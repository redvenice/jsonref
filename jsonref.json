And I was so sad, because I wasn\u0027t sure my parents supported a theater career.\u0027Wanting to please her  parents, Earhardt enrolled at Florida State University to study orthodontics. But \u0027in my heart, I was drawn to PR,\u0027 she wrote.The debutante and Alpha Delta Pi sorority sister said that changed to broadcast journalism after a trip to New York with a church group.Earhardt said she\u0027s woken up at 3am to wait outside the Today show to hold up a bright pink sign that said \u0027Will you marry me Matt Lauer?\u0027The then-college student even appeared on the Today show when Al Roker spotted the pink poster board proposal. She told Extra that Roker had \u0027made this big joke about will you marry this girl, and he said \u0027yes.\u0027 \u0027And he said, \u0027I want to register at Tiffany\u0027s.\u0027  Earhardt joined Fox \u0026amp Friends as co-host in 2016, pictured with fellow cohosts Steve Doocy (left) Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade (right) in New York in January          Seasoned pro: Earhardt began working for the network in 2007 and has been a frequent contributor and substitute host on Fox \u0026amp Friends (above with Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy and Kris Jenner in October 2014)This was many years before Lauer was fired from the show after he was accused of sexually assaulting and harassing several female colleagues.  Almost a decade after her proposal to Lauer, Earhardt found herself sitting in Roger Ailes\u0027s office, overlooking Rockefeller Center, interviewing for a job at Fox News. \u0027All I could think was how did I get here?\u0027 she wrote.Earhardt joined the network in 2007, soon landing her own slot, \u0027Ainsley Across America,\u0027 on Sean Hannity\u0027s show, before she became the host of a new morning wake show called Fox \u0026amp Friends First in 2012. She joined Fox \u0026amp Friends as co-host in 2016.It was that year that women began coming forward to accuse Ailes and others at the network of sexual harassment.But in her decade at the network, Earhardt said she\u0027d never seen any such behavior. \u0027I\u0027ve never been in a situation like that, thankfully,\u0027 she wrote. A fellow anchorwoman at the station, Deborah Knapp, described Earhardt as \u0027very loyal\u0027 and \u0027naive\u0027. \u0027I can see how she wouldn\u0027t be aware of that,\u0027 she added.  Earhardt held up a sign that read \u0027Will you marry me Matt Lauer?\u0027 Spotting her in the crowd, Lauer joked that he would and that he wanted \u0027to register at Tiffany\u0027s\u0027. This was years before he was fired amid sexual assault and harassment allegations           She also recalled her interview with then-Fox boss Roger Ailes in 2007 Ailes was fired in 2016 after women accused him of sexual harassment but Earhardt, 41, says she never saw any of that behavior at the networkEarhardt, a 41-year-old mom-of-one, who is married to former Clemson University quarterback Will Proctor, said despite the recent scandals to hit the network and the critics who have dismissed her a blonde, make up loving \u0027Barbie\u0027, she \u0027love(s) my life\u0027.   \u0027I have my dream job. I have this wonderful schedule where I work full-time and also get to be a full-time mom.\u0027She admits she knew little about politics until joining Fox, but her conservative, traditional Christian views match those of its viewers.Earhardt said that wanted to better reflect both sides of the aisle, and had even invited Hillary Clinton on the show during the 2016 election - although Clinton had always declined.She said that wished there wasn\u0027t so much ision in the country. But in the next breath, she complained about the backlash Fox often receives from Democrats and liberals over its partisanship and failure to hold the president to account - often ignoring negative stories about Donald Trump or quickly changing the topic to something more on topic for Fox fans, such as immigration. \u0027I feel like the left wants to destroy Fox News,\u0027 she said, adding that the feeling wasn\u0027t mutual.When asked if Fox wanted to destroy the left, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t feel I do.\u0027\u0027I think that makes America wonderful, that we have different opinions.\u0027She also doesn\u0027t believe that biased or partisan shows like Fox contribute to the country\u0027s polarization.          Earhardt is married to former Clemson University quarterback Will Proctor (pictured with her)          She is a mom-of-one to two-year-old daughter, Hayden (pictured with her) \u0027I don\u0027t feel like that,\u0027 she said. \u0027You can choose what channel you want to watch.\u0027Aside from her work, and her family, Earhardt said her Christianity is the biggest focus of her life.She begins each chapter of her new memoir, The Light Within Me: An Inspirational Memoir, produced with a ghostwriter, with a passage from Scripture.In it she describes growing up in a large religious community, going to Lutheran services with her family, and receiving regular letters from \u0027Jesus\u0027, which she suspects were sent from her father, reminding her to acknowledge her faith.She even had a religious experience while studying at USC after transferring to study journalism. While on a trip to the mountains with friends. While the group was having fun, smoking marijuana and playing music, she said she walked to the back steps and started speaking to God.\u0027I want this void in my life filled forever,\u0027 she said. \u0027I want it filled with you.\u0027 After that she stopped drinking and began writing \u0027love letters\u0027 to God in her journals.Now living in New York\u0027s Upper East Side with her second husband and daughter, she says she is hoping to have a break from work to spend some time with her family.But says, \u0027if God tells me to write another book, then I will.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/23/4EE985ED00000578-0-image-m-68_1533681396602.jpg","title":"ITV launching streaming app new 15 minute shows compete Netflix Amazon Prime","story":"    A new streaming service can be watched exclusively on smartphonesOriginal content will include sitcoms, dramas, reality shows and documentaries, but not live TV. It is hoped the service will launch by Christmas of 2019. NewTV has raised £780million from investors and is led by Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney\u0027s DreamWorks Animation, and Meg Whitman, the ex-chief executive of Hewlett Packard.Mr Katzenberg reportedly once offered £58million to the creators of the popular US drama Breaking Bad to make three more episodes which would have been released in short segments online over the course of a month.

She’s also a very beautiful, very famous and very successful movie star who for the past 12 years has been married to a very handsome, very famous and very successful movie star  Angelina Jolie always like to remind us she\u0027s \u0027more\u0027 than an actress. She’s a Special Envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, regularly embarking on trips to war-torn countriesEXCLUSIVE: Rosé-colored glasses! Brad and Angelina\u0027s Chateau...Brad Pitt is pictured at law office amid bitter custody...Share this article    This week Angelina launched a savage public attack on her husband Brad Pitt, the father to their six children. The message was crystal clear: Brad’s a deadbeat dad. Furious Pitt hit back immediately, saying he’d loaned his wife $8 million for a house in which to live with their children, and given her $1.3 million for bills. That’s a lot of money for 18 months of childcareFriends told the New York Post he had fulfilled all financial obligations to his kids, including payments for therapists, travel expenses and round-the-clock bodyguards.The friends added that Jolie is being ‘ridiculously unreasonable’ and is ‘fuelled by anger’.They also said how hurt Pitt is by her decision to make this damning ‘deadbeat dad’ allegation in open court rather than in front of a private judge as the rest of the orce has so far been heard.I’m sure he is.It’s hard to imagine a worse thing for any father to be accused of then failing to take proper care of his children.It’s also hard to imagine a worse thing for any child than reading, or seeing on TV, that their father is a mean tightwad who refuses to take responsibility for them.In any orce, a lot of mud gets slung.No marriage ends happily, whatever absurd PR spin some celebrity couples try to put on their ‘conscious uncoupling’.But when children are involved, the right thing to do, indeed the imperative thing to do, is to keep the mudslinging behind closed doors.If you’re going to shout insults at each other, do it when the kids can’t hear it.If you want to make very damaging legal claims about each other, then don’t do it in open court.This is particularly important for anyone famous because once this stuff gets into the public domain, then it stays there for your children to read for the rest of their lives.Angelina Jolie knows this better than anyone, as she’s now been married three times.  Angelina should know that once it\u0027s in the public domain it\u0027s there for your children to read forever. She\u0027e been married three times (seen here with first husband Johnny Lee Miller) and she lived through her own famous parents\u0027 bitter orce after Jon Voight cheatedShe also knows from her own parents’ bitter orce (her mother Marcheline Bertrand left her father Jon Voight when Angelina was a toddler, after he cheated) how scarring it can be to have lurid details of your parents’ break-up set in permanent internet stone.So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?And why would she further compound the children’s unhappiness by making it hard for him to see them when he wants to?Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids.But Jolie has apparently been resisting this so vigorously that the orce judge reportedly warned her in June to stop it or risk losing primary custody.He was also said to have ordered her to provide Pitt with a cell phone number for each child, to allow him to call whenever he wants, barred her from reading the children’s text messages from their father, and laid out a summer schedule for each child to see him.I don’t know the truth about what’s gone wrong in the Brangelina marriage – only they do.          So why would she decide to publicly humiliate her own children’s father like this?  Unlike most ‘deadbeat dads’, Pitt has been fighting to see more, not less of his kids. But Jolie has apparently been resisting this vigorously. I don\u0027t know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious mannerBy his own admission, Brad wasn’t a perfect father or husband and seemed to have hit some kind of mid-life crisis by the time they split.Nor do I know why Angelina is now behaving in such an irrational and vicious manner. Though some fear her rage may not be entirely unconnected to the fact his new girlfriend is a stunning and brilliantly clever MIT professor, Neri Oxman.However, what I do know is that Angelina’s decision to publicly attack him this week can only turn out to be incredibly damaging to their children.And it sits very uneasily with her claim that those children ‘will always come first’.But then what Angelina says and does are often two very different things.For example, she once said: ‘To be intimate with a married men, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn’t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.’Then she fell in love with Jennifer Anniston’s husband Brad Pitt on the film Mr and Mrs Smith, and stole him from her.So Angelina’s halo, which she ruthlessly ensures has an almost permanent glisten to it, may not shine quite so brightly when she looks away from the mirror.There’s also another weird aspect to her court action this week.Angelina Jolie has always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life.           Angelina’s halo may not shine quite so brightly anymore . Also, she\u0027s always proudly affirmed herself as a tough, independent woman who doesn’t need a man to help her get on in life. So WHY now look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?The true embodiment, you might think, of modern feminism.And she’s been remarkably successful at it, making more money from movies and endorsements than almost any actress in history.So why would she now want to make herself look so grasping, whining, needy and man-reliant?If Angelina Jolie really thinks Brad Pitt is a useless deadbeat dad, then what better way to prove it then to tell him to stuff his money where the sun don’t shine and provide for her kids herself?She can certainly easily afford to if she wishes.Instead, she’s chosen to deliberately, and what may well be falsely, embarrass the father of her children in public.That’s such a weak, cheap shot Angelina – especially for a humanitarian who says she always puts her children first."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/19/4EF4FE5100000578-6044653-image-a-24_1533838484154.jpg","title":"Lions lionesses playing London Zoo match Gareth Southgates lions","story":"    Having a gnawsome time trying to get at the catnip, this Asiatic lioness tries to get its claws into a Boomer ball filled with the herb during a photocall at the ZSL London Zoo, ahead of World Lion Day (August 10)          Not so cuddly now: a lioness growls at the approaching Bhanu, right. Asiatic lions are up to 2.9m in length, from nose to tail, and the males weigh about 160-190kg, while the females weigh 110-120kg.

Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that I respect the process of justice.\u0027 But, as criticism mounted over her use of the word \u0027banter\u0027 in her evidence, an apologetic Mrs Harris responded: \u0027I understand that banter was an entirely inappropriate, indeed offensive, word to use.\u0027I honestly do not remember making such a comment, and hearing it alleged in court struck me to the core.\u0027It is a word that many LGBT people have heard to justify homophobic abuse for too long. And I apologise — unreservedly and unequivocally — for my use of it.\u0027Miss Clarke, who is still unemployed, is planning to lodge a complaint with Ipsa and the Labour Party, says: \u0027That\u0027s all well and good, but where\u0027s my apology?\u0027For nine years I was loyal to Carolyn and kept quiet, but not any more. She has to go.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/15/4D9DC75F00000578-0-image-m-148_1529935362789.jpg","title":"Voyeur 57 caught taking upskirt pictures tourists underwear outside Buckingham Palace","story":"    Richard Sivier, 57, was caught secretly filming and taking pictures of tourists outside of Buckingham Palace (stock image)A woman pushing a child in a buggy was among his targets, Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court was told. When he was approached by police, Sivier confessed to \u0027upskirting\u0027 and told them he had been carrying out his \u0027hobby of sorts\u0027 for 18 months in Cambridge and London.Denise Johnson, prosecuting said: \u0027On 20 June at 11:15am police officers, on Spur Road in the Buckingham Palace area, received a call about a man filming up skirts.Women teachers \u0027are being upskirted by sex pest pupils\u0027 with...Wolf-whistling and cat-calling will NOT be treated as hate...Share this article\u0027They saw Mr Sivier and decided to follow him.\u0027He began to film a woman who was about 25 years old, walking with another man, and he then positioned his bag near her.\u0027The officers saw that there was a lens poking out of the bag and the female did not seem to know what was going on.

Experts at the University of Warwick said the hard-sell language and tactics used by the gambling companies created the impression that viewers should rush to have a betThe researchers in applied psychology were also concerned that some adverts were designed in such a way that punters were likely to misjudge the probabilities of winning. One bookmaker advertised a bet ahead on England versus Tunisia, which included: \u0027England to win by three or more goals, Harry Kane to score, and over 11 corners\u0027. The odds were 16-to-1, but customers would only win if all three elements turned out to be correct.The academics said because each part of the bet feels likely to happen, people overestimate the chances of all three elements occurring. In fact, anyone who took up the bet lost, because while Harry Kane scored twice, England only won by a single goal margin. Betting firm William Hill warns it may have to close 900...Betting firms who target youngsters in adverts will face...Share this articlePrevious research by the group found these bets come in less often than fans think and have very high profit margins for the bookies.The research report entitled \u0027Impulsiveness and urgency: Gambling advertising and the 2018 soccer World Cup\u0027 was written by Dr Philip Newall, Mr Ankush Thobhani, Dr Lukasz Walasek and Professor Caroline Meyer.Dr Newall said: \u0027Technology and legislation have transformed the UK\u0027s gambling scene.

Struggling to cope: Trolleys in NHS corridors as shown in the BBC series HospitalHealth bosses say the NHS is in the midst of a ‘summer crisis’ with soaring temperatures leaving hospitals running at ‘boiling point all year round’.Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the heatwave had led to increases in attendances and admissions in those suffering from dehydration, particularly the frail elderly.He warned the increased pressure on services was likely to be bad news for the coming winter, when trusts face their busiest time.‘The summer months are traditionally the time acute hospitals and frontline staff have to recharge the batteries – this year we have had no respite and draining conditions,’ he said.The surge in attendances has been blamed for worsening waiting times, with more than 4.3 million patients waiting to start treatment.Urgent referrals for cancer treatment have now been breached for 30 months in a row, with just 79.2 per cent of patients seen within 62 days – well below the target of 85 per cent.In A\u0026ampE, the number of patients being seen within four hours fell to 89.3 per cent, compared to 90.7 per cent in June and 90.3 per cent in July 2017.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: ‘The summer has provided no respite for NHS staff who are now working flat out to meet unsustainable levels of demand both in the summer and the winter. This is a symptom of an NHS running at boiling point all year round.’ NHS England said: ‘As temperatures soared, the NHS saw an unprecedented summer surge last month.‘Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in ten people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours.’÷ Nearly a fifth of children and young people referred for an eating disorder wait four weeks or longer for treatment, according to figures yesterday.The share of ordinary cases being seen within four weeks – the NHS target waiting time – was 79.9 per cent in the three months between April and June.

He has swum in a glacial lake on Everest and braved the freezing waters off Antarctica. He was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five of Earth\u0027s oceans, and has swum the length of the Thames. And now he aims to become the first person to swim the full length of the Channel — that\u0027s 330 miles.The narrowest distance across the Channel is a mere 22 miles. Since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim it in 1875 (though he went off course and ended up swimming 39 miles), 1,800 people have emulated him, including Pugh in 1992.But no one has ever swum its full length — the equivalent of 15 Channel crossings, from Land\u0027s End to Dover, in just cap, goggles and swimming trunks.          United Nations Environment Programme Patron of the Oceans Lewis Pugh at the Speedo and Surfers Against Sewage Marazion Beach Clean UpUnder Channel Swimming Association rules, that — plus as much grease as he wants — is all Pugh is allowed to wear. He mustn\u0027t touch his support boat, the Aquila, during his daily swims, or ever swim behind it or behind another person, because he might then benefit from the slipstream.Pugh started at Land\u0027s End on July 12 and after 28 days has completed about 180 miles, following the coastline at a distance and generally, when not swimming, spending all his time on the support boat, which must drop anchor whenever he finishes a swim.

He has also been struggling with a shoulder injury and yesterday saw a physiotherapist at AFC Bournemouth.So why is he doing it?

Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that I respect the process of justice.\u0027 But, as criticism mounted over her use of the word \u0027banter\u0027 in her evidence, an apologetic Mrs Harris responded: \u0027I understand that banter was an entirely inappropriate, indeed offensive, word to use.\u0027I honestly do not remember making such a comment, and hearing it alleged in court struck me to the core.\u0027It is a word that many LGBT people have heard to justify homophobic abuse for too long. And I apologise — unreservedly and unequivocally — for my use of it.\u0027Miss Clarke, who is still unemployed, is planning to lodge a complaint with Ipsa and the Labour Party, says: \u0027That\u0027s all well and good, but where\u0027s my apology?\u0027For nine years I was loyal to Carolyn and kept quiet, but not any more. She has to go.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/15/4D9DC75F00000578-0-image-m-148_1529935362789.jpg","title":"Voyeur 57 caught taking upskirt pictures tourists underwear outside Buckingham Palace","story":"    Richard Sivier, 57, was caught secretly filming and taking pictures of tourists outside of Buckingham Palace (stock image)A woman pushing a child in a buggy was among his targets, Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court was told. When he was approached by police, Sivier confessed to \u0027upskirting\u0027 and told them he had been carrying out his \u0027hobby of sorts\u0027 for 18 months in Cambridge and London.Denise Johnson, prosecuting said: \u0027On 20 June at 11:15am police officers, on Spur Road in the Buckingham Palace area, received a call about a man filming up skirts.Women teachers \u0027are being upskirted by sex pest pupils\u0027 with...Wolf-whistling and cat-calling will NOT be treated as hate...Share this article\u0027They saw Mr Sivier and decided to follow him.\u0027He began to film a woman who was about 25 years old, walking with another man, and he then positioned his bag near her.\u0027The officers saw that there was a lens poking out of the bag and the female did not seem to know what was going on.

Struggling to cope: Trolleys in NHS corridors as shown in the BBC series HospitalHealth bosses say the NHS is in the midst of a ‘summer crisis’ with soaring temperatures leaving hospitals running at ‘boiling point all year round’.Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said the heatwave had led to increases in attendances and admissions in those suffering from dehydration, particularly the frail elderly.He warned the increased pressure on services was likely to be bad news for the coming winter, when trusts face their busiest time.‘The summer months are traditionally the time acute hospitals and frontline staff have to recharge the batteries – this year we have had no respite and draining conditions,’ he said.The surge in attendances has been blamed for worsening waiting times, with more than 4.3 million patients waiting to start treatment.Urgent referrals for cancer treatment have now been breached for 30 months in a row, with just 79.2 per cent of patients seen within 62 days – well below the target of 85 per cent.In A\u0026ampE, the number of patients being seen within four hours fell to 89.3 per cent, compared to 90.7 per cent in June and 90.3 per cent in July 2017.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: ‘The summer has provided no respite for NHS staff who are now working flat out to meet unsustainable levels of demand both in the summer and the winter. This is a symptom of an NHS running at boiling point all year round.’ NHS England said: ‘As temperatures soared, the NHS saw an unprecedented summer surge last month.‘Thanks to the hard work of staff, nine in ten people were seen, treated and admitted or discharged within four hours.’÷ Nearly a fifth of children and young people referred for an eating disorder wait four weeks or longer for treatment, according to figures yesterday.The share of ordinary cases being seen within four weeks – the NHS target waiting time – was 79.9 per cent in the three months between April and June.

He has swum in a glacial lake on Everest and braved the freezing waters off Antarctica. He was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five of Earth\u0027s oceans, and has swum the length of the Thames. And now he aims to become the first person to swim the full length of the Channel — that\u0027s 330 miles.The narrowest distance across the Channel is a mere 22 miles. Since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim it in 1875 (though he went off course and ended up swimming 39 miles), 1,800 people have emulated him, including Pugh in 1992.But no one has ever swum its full length — the equivalent of 15 Channel crossings, from Land\u0027s End to Dover, in just cap, goggles and swimming trunks.          United Nations Environment Programme Patron of the Oceans Lewis Pugh at the Speedo and Surfers Against Sewage Marazion Beach Clean UpUnder Channel Swimming Association rules, that — plus as much grease as he wants — is all Pugh is allowed to wear. He mustn\u0027t touch his support boat, the Aquila, during his daily swims, or ever swim behind it or behind another person, because he might then benefit from the slipstream.Pugh started at Land\u0027s End on July 12 and after 28 days has completed about 180 miles, following the coastline at a distance and generally, when not swimming, spending all his time on the support boat, which must drop anchor whenever he finishes a swim.

The airline has cancelled about 400 flights as a result.Ryanair faces renewed pressure from unhappy workers after it agreed to recognise trade unions for pilots and cabin crew in December – something the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, had previously said he would rather cut off his hands than agree to. Strikes were partly to blame for profits falling in the first quarter of its financial year.But after making deals with unions in countries including the UK and Italy, the airline has failed to engage with workers, unions claim. Pilots and cabin crew have responded with a string of strikes seeking better terms and conditions. Cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain walked out for 48 hours last month.Unions have alleged Ryanair is using other tactics to deter workers from striking.While most EU countries allow companies to dock pay from striking staff, union sources said Ryanair threatened to strip crew of productivity bonuses and warned that their promotion chances would be affected, which would be in breach of labour laws.In a letter from Ryanair’s chief people officer, Eddie Wilson, to Spanish crew, the airline promised that “no one can be punished or victimised” if they chose to strike. But one cabin crew member showed the  a subsequent letter that said they would lose their monthly productivity bonus.The letter continued: “All no-shows are recorded in your absence record and are taken into consideration along with all relevant factors of performance when assessing promotion and transfer opportunities.”The Independent Transport Workers Federation (ITF), an umbrella body for trade unions, said Ryanair could be hit with lawsuits for allegedly breaching labour laws in several countries.“Unions in countries directly affected by all the latest actions against Ryanair workers are pursuing a mixture of legal claims and investigations with the appropriate government agencies,” said ITF’s general secretary, Stephen Cotton. “They are having to claim once again that Ryanair are infringing their members’ fundamental rights in breach of labour laws in their country.”A Ryanair spokesperson said: “As with any company dealing with industrial relations disputes and strike action, employee attendance is recorded so that pay can be adjusted accordingly. Participation in a strike does not affect promotion or transfer decisions and this was also confirmed to our crew.”O’Leary has said he is willing to deal with short-term disruption rather than give in to demands that undermine the low-fare, low-cost business model that has made Ryanair Europe’s biggest airline.But investors are showing signs of doubt. Ryanair shares have lost a fifth of their value in the past year while its low-cost rival easyJet, which has long-standing union agreements, saw its share price rise by a fifth.Most equity analysts argue Ryanair will be able to get through the turmoil. Gerald Khoo at broker Liberum said: “There is space for Ryanair management to reach sensible agreements so that Ryanair will have the same profitability in the long term.”HSBC aviation analyst Andrew Lobbenderg argues that Ryanair’s industrial relations problems call into question its low-cost model and its governance. Its troubles may lie partly in the lack of challenge by board members to their “high-profile, charismatic CEO”, Lobbenberg said.“We foresee higher wages, social costs, reduced productivity, flexibility and higher overhead costs,” Lobbenberg wrote in a note to investors. “The evolution towards employment practices more in line with industry norms will structurally weaken profitability and thus poses deeper questions to management and the board.”Until recently, Ryanair was able to ide its workforce by striking different deals across the countries it flies between. Containing the strikes may be difficult for a company whose historic failure to recognise unions leaves it with little experience to draw on for a major dispute.Tony Dunden, professor of human resource management and labour relations at Manchester University, said: “The idea of riding it out is typical of a small entrepreneurial mindset rather than a more sophisticated management process. The key problem is the potential for escalation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff15973bc24e2527cb588d088f23661330ecfaa9/251_1882_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8149cafc0e873976cc0f7e3d077237dd","title":"eternal city dome rome monochrome photography in pictures","story":"The Royal Institute of British Architects has thousand of black and white photographs of the Eternal City.

Theresa May and other ministers have gone on a sales drive with European leaders for this approach, while Jeremy Hunt warns from the sidelines that the two sides are heading for no deal by accident and Liam Fox goes further by saying that a no-deal outcome is more likely than a deal. This looks like what it is: a coordinated strategy to try to push the European commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, into a more accommodating response.There are two big problems with this strategy. First, it is difficult to see that there is enough in the government’s Brexit white paper to encourage the EU to run with such an approach. Unless the UK is prepared to make more concessions, too much of the give is on the EU side and too much of the take is on the British one. Yet if Mrs May makes concessions, she will struggle to get such a package through parliament without splitting her party.The second big problem is the clock. The wake-up calls about what is at stake for different sectors and regions of Britain in the Brexit endgame now come thick and fast. This isn’t a conspiracy but a statement of realities. This week, there have been several warnings which, in a more thoughtful and responsible political culture than Britain’s, would be treated as seriously shocking. They should not be dismissed as “project fear”, though that will not stop unscrupulous leaver propagandists from trying.On Monday, for example, Britain’s police chiefs said they feared a “substantial risk to public safety”, by losing access to cross-border detention processes and databases if the UK crashes out in March. The same day, the health department itself said that fewer EU care workers would mean more UK women giving up work to take over. On Tuesday, the National Farmers’ Union warned that the UK could run out of food at this time next year if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. And a group representing the million-plus Poles in Britain voiced fears that they could become illegal immigrants and urged Theresa May to ringfence their rights. But it continues. On Wednesday, pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca said a no-deal Brexit threatened the trade in vital cancer, heart and lung medicines. The same day, the pound fell to its lowest level against the euro this year, hitting British holidaymakers in their pockets. Some of those currency market losses were recouped on Thursday, but not before one of the UK’s biggest recruitment agencies had announced that Brexit uncertainties are slowing the jobs market as companies hunker down and refuse avoidable risks.It has now taken the CBI to do what a responsible government would have done 18 months ago – to set out detailed proposals for a balanced post-Brexit immigration strategy. Ministers will say they can’t do this because of the negotiations, but if they had thought out an immigration policy before invoking article 50 too soon they would be in a stronger position. The fact remains that Brexit is a choice by Britain, and Britain alone. The EU does not want it to happen and is dedicated to ensuring that the EU27 do not pay the price for Britain’s wrong decision. There are only three outcomes now. No deal is one of them. A Norway-type compromise is the second. And the reversal of Brexit is the third. As the CBI report says, this is not theoretical. It is about the nation’s future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0511ac795d0d59eafb1ff13a931fe27d0c576d03/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1799ff53d83b64a5f6ec3e06b7b97bf8","title":"puke pasties and poo the secret stinky world of cinema ushers","story":"They sign up for pick’n’mix and free films, but have to deal with rutting teenagers, rotting food and cups of excrement. Who knew the movies were so gross?Cinema’s real superheroes are not the vigilantes in Lycra who caper around on the big screens, but the underpaid employees stalking the aisles armed only with popcorn sweepers. Each season presents ushers with distinct challenges. At Christmas, parents use cinemas as a creche as they go present-shopping come spring, they let their Easter-egg-stuffed offspring vomit in the cup holders but the six-week summer holiday stretch is the most intense, when a combination of boredom and blockbusters turns everyone feral.A decade ago, I was part of a teenage cohort working for minimum wage at a small cinema in Cornwall. I learned many valuable lessons, such as how to answer the question: “What do you mean: ‘It’s sold out?’” with no trace of sarcasm. I learned about the toxic powder that could turn liquid sick into a scoopable solid. I discovered that humanity was even richer than the green (The Incredible Hulk), moneyed (Sex and the City) and melodramatic (Mamma Mia!) tapestry on screen. There were ways of making life easier, such as reminding tourists used to chain multiplexes that our films actually started at the time advertised. Telling sweet old ladies where a period drama was set meant they didn’t wait until the end of the credits to find out, thus hastening their exit and allowing us to clean up sooner. Not that fans of The Duchess made much mess compared with the Iron Man aficionados.Other behavioural oddities were less preventable: as well as “sold out”, “reserved seating” was apparently a difficult concept to grasp. Like most cinemas, we turned a blind eye to food brought in from outside. But we had to enforce a specific ban on pasties, which aren’t only messy, but also smell uncannily like BO. This made asking customers whether they were smuggling in a large Rowe’s steak pasty an awkward conversation – maybe they just had poor hygiene. I once found an empty seafood platter under a seat and felt for the neighbour of whoever sat there slurping down whelks like wet, fishy popcorn. On witnessing a blowjob in progress in the back row, I sprinted down the hallway to ask the manager what to do. “Stop them, obviously!” I legged it back: it was all over. Never had I been so grateful for the speedy satisfaction of teenage boys.But after speaking to a crop of current and former ushers, I think we got off lightly. One employee of a Hertfordshire cinema shudders to recall a recent “week of bodily fluids” that left staff capable of identifying a comprehensive range of effluents at a glance. Gary from Manchester explains that the ushers would often consume the sweets that customers left behind, but never the drinks. “Not after the time we found that someone had left behind a hot wee in one Pepsi cup and a steaming shit in another. Was Transformers: Dark of the Moon so interesting that they couldn’t have left to go to the toilet?”You sign up for a cinema summer job envisaging free films and pockets stuffed with stolen pick’n’mix, not, as a distressing amount of ushers lament, confronting cinemagoers’ desire to poo anywhere but the toilets. As if bringing a baby to the cinema weren’t antisocial enough, some parents change their nappies in a screen. “As I was hurriedly collecting filth for minimum wage, my foot knocked against something weighty under a seat,” says Rory, also from Manchester. “I reached under, picked it up and held it up to the light. I realised I was holding a used, full nappy. I can confirm that we provided baby-changing facilities.” The environmental catastrophe that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson tackles in San Andreas pales in comparison with the used sanitary towel that Holly from Letchworth Garden City found after a screening of the 2015 disaster movie.People have been misbehaving at the cinema for as long as cinemas have existed. Patrons of the silent film era had to be reminded to remove large hats and were asked not to whistle. “We’re not observable in the dark, so we feel less inhibited in a variety of different ways,” says Cary Cooper, a specialist in organisational psychology. “You think you can get away with totally inappropriate behaviour that you wouldn’t do if it was light.” It is worse in “island cultures” such as Britain, he says, where we are “more inhibited to confront people about their breaking of the norms”.Every week, listeners write in to Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo’s BBC Radio 5 Live Film Review to complain about cinemagoers contravening the code of conduct that the pair created in 2010. (“No rustling”, “no slurping”, “no shoe removal”, etc.) “I think it was probably linked to the explosion in mobile phone use,” says Mayo. “I’ve been in films where people have been taking photographs of the crowd – with flash – during the film. All these kinds of things wouldn’t have been possible or thought of a few years ago. It’s the digital revolution that has changed everything and I think that’s the fuel behind the rage we tap into every week.”Mayo wonders whether cuts in cinema staffing have led to a rise in unchecked bad behaviour. “The very thought of an usher coming in and telling people to be quiet or put their phone away – it would be incomprehensible.” The code is intended as a stand against slipping standards, even though he knows that most of the show’s listeners conform to Cooper’s bystander effect, seething silently rather than confronting offenders.One type of cinema delinquency has a more complex social history than simply chucking popcorn around. “Just as the cinema generated new opportunities for working-class courtship, so did it have a similar impact on queer culture,” writes Matt Houlbrook in Queer London: Perils and Pleasures of the Sexual polis, 1918-1957. When homosexuality was illegal in Britain, many gay men held clandestine assignations in cinemas. “Indoors yet public, commercial yet open, music halls and cinemas sustained a sexual culture unlike anywhere else,” writes Houlbrook. “None of the outdoor locations where men found sex were as safe. In none were the sexual opportunities as concentrated.”Wishing to escape parental scrutiny but lacking the cash for hotels, teenagers also made a sexual sanctuary of the cinema. “Mothers of America  let your kids go to the movies!” Frank O’Hara wrote in his poem Ave Maria. “They may even be grateful to you  for their first sexual experience  which only cost you a quarter  and didn’t upset the peaceful home.”A chilling number of ushers mention finding sex toys – some still packaged, some not. Knickers and used condoms are regularly left among the popcorn crumbs. One usher recalls a colleague finding a bloodied teenage girl in the toilets. “She was physically OK, although maybe emotionally and mentally scarred.” Rough sex in the seats had caused her partner’s foreskin to tear. “He was, reasonably so, panicking. When we said we had to call the ambulance and even their parents, they freaked out even more. Turns out they weren’t dating – he was her boyfriend’s best mate.”One way of tackling cinematic misdemeanours, says Cooper, would be to turn up the lights a bit. But where would be the fun in that? It is possible that highlighting the poor ushers left to pick up your popcorn (or pants) might deter patrons from acting up, he says, citing the success of similar safety campaigns on motorways. “It does inhibit that behaviour when you make it human.”So, this summer, try your best not to subject the underpaid ushers to horrors beyond having to watch Hotel Transylvania 3 eight times a day. Arrive on time, put your mess in the bin and, for God’s sake, use the toilets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa58f290852ba3234d62d6d731449c45226c3f7/0_91_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03efcba13dbf34a61d767575e203ae69","title":"everton make four major signings in end to transfer window","story":"Everton produced a remarkable end to the transfer window as they made three significant additions to Marco Silva’s squad in Yerry Mina, Bernard and André Gomes.Bernard was first to sign on deadline day after receiving a work permit to move to the Premier League following five seasons at Shakhtar Donetsk.The Brazil winger, a free agent having allowed his contract with Ukraine’s champions to expire at the end of last season, signed a four-year contract at Goodison Park. Bernard wanted £200,000 a week earlier in the summer but the 25‑year‑old ultimately lowered demands that had deterred interest from West Ham, Chelsea and Milan, among others. While Bernard was finalising his transfer at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground a club delegation led by the director of football, Marcel Brands, concluded deals for Mina and Gomes in Barcelona.Mina, the Colombia centre-half who scored against Jordan Pickford at the World Cup, was a priority signing for Silva amid concern over his central defensive options. Despite interest from Manchester United and Lyon in the 23-year-old, and after a six-week pursuit by Everton, the defender was finally secured on a five-year deal for an initial €30.25m (£27.2m) plus €1.5m in add-ons. The fee represents a healthy profit for the Spanish champions, who signed Mina from Palmeiras for €11.8m (£10.6m) only in January and obtained a buy-back option in the deal. His arrival takes Everton’s spend on permanent transfers this summer to £86m.During negotiations for Mina, Everton were offered Gomes on a season-long loan, the Portugal midfielder having struggled at Barcelona since his €35m (£31.5m) arrival from Valencia two years ago. Everton agreed a €2.25m (£2.02m) loan fee for the 25-year-old, who currently has a minor injury but passed a medical held in Barcelona, and will pay his wages in full for the season.Everton’s new manager wanted two central defenders before the deadline and will find out on Friday whether he is successful in his bid to take Kurt Zouma from Chelsea. The France international, who spent last season on loan at Stoke City, had also been linked with Old Trafford but had been in line to become Everton’s fourth recruit of the day after paperwork was submitted moments before the 5pm deadline.While Brands landed Everton’s main targets the club were less successful in reducing an already over-sized squad. Muhamed Besic was lined up for a £6m return to Middlesbrough only for the deal to collapse late on while Everton rejected several loan offers for Yannick Bolasie, who they want to sell on a permanent basis. Both could leave on loan later this month, however. Nikola Vlasic is another who could depart with CSKA Moscow interested in a loan deal for the Croatia winger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9573afed4d854b55dc1defd4b886a81dc032690/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=609d3578154a17b9cfb48b4ceaa2f91f","title":"transfer window premier league club by club verdict","story":"Arsenal, West Ham and Wolves were busy while Everton and Fulham left it late, Manchester United fell short and Spurs did not sign anyoneArsenal’s biggest move of the summer was replacing Arsène Wenger with Unai Emery, but they have also strengthened their squad with five new signings. Bernd Leno will challenge Petr Cech in goal, while centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos and full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner will add experience at the back. Uruguay’s Lucas Torreira and 19-year-old Matteo Guendouzi are intriguing additions in midfield. Jacob SteinbergIt was not straightforward but Eddie Howe eventually secured his No 1 target with Jefferson Lerma, the Colombia midfielder, joining for a club-record £25m fee. The Cherries did not go wild this summer but in Levante’s Diego Rico they have provided long-serving left-back Charlie Daniels with serious competition, while Howe can unlock the raw potential of David Brooks, the 20-year-old Wales international midfielder who joins from Sheffield United. Ben FisherChris Hughton focused on adding competition in defence, signing Leon Balogun and Bernardo after watching the pair impress in the Bundesliga, and Brighton also broke their transfer record to sign Alireza Jahanbakhsh from AZ Alkmaar. The Iranian winger scored 21 goals in the Ereisie last season. It was a productive summer for the Seagulls, with full-back Martin Montoya arriving on deadline day. JSIn: Alireza Jahanbakhsh AZ Alkmaar, £17m Yves Bissouma Lille, £15m Bernardo RB Leipzig £9m Florin Andone Deportivo, £5.3m Percy Tau Mamelodi Sundowns £3m Martin Montoya Valencia und David Button Fulham und Dan Burn Wigan, und (loaned back) Billy Arce CSD Independiente, und (loaned to Extremadura).A fruitful final week eased Sean Dyche’s frustrations after a difficult summer. The Burnley manager strengthened in central defence with Ben Gibson, added to his collection of England goalkeepers by ending Joe Hart’s 12-year association with Manchester City and, while unable to re-sign Jay Rodriguez, secured the Championship’s leading goalscorer from last season in Matej Vydra. Andy Hunter Neil Warnock’s early signings, a quartet who have excelled in the Championship, fit his mould of working with hungry players. They failed to lure Marko Grujic back from Liverpool and the deadline day arrivals of midfielders Victor Camarasa and Bournemouth’s Harry Arter do not mask how light the newcomers are in terms of Premier League experience and firepower. BFChelsea’s summer was fraught and political, with recruitment delayed until Antonio Conte had left and Maurizio Sarri arrived. Jorginho will implement the new head coach’s philosophy on the pitch. Thibaut Courtois’ fractious departure was costly, with a world record fee required to secure Kepa, available for £17.9m in January. Keeping Eden Hazard was key, but a penny for the thoughts of Ruben Loftus-Cheek over the loan signing of Mateo Kovacic. Dominic FifieldMoney was tight at Selhurst Park, with a restrictive wage bill that restricted expenditure and hefty payments due to Liverpool for Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho. Losing Yohan Cabaye was a blow, and replacing Ruben Loftus-Cheek was awkward. So to bring in four players for an outlay of £9.5m, plus wages, was impressive. Max Meyer has a point to prove, and Vicente Guaita was one of the best goalkeepers in Spain last season. DFHaving spent most of the summer trying to reduce the wage bill and squad size, Everton went into overdrive on deadline day with three eye-catching signings. Brazil international Bernard arrived on a free transfer while a club delegation flew to Barcelona to complete deals for defender Yerry Mina and André Gomes, the latter on loan. AHFulham’s business, on paper at least, looks hugely impressive. A squad bolstered by loanees last season appears to have been upgraded. Securing Jean Michaël Seri from Nice was a coup, Alfie Mawson has aspirations to break into the England squad, while André Schürrle is a World Cup winner. Aleksandar Mitrovic returns and five players, including full-back Joe Bryan, forward Luciano Vietto and Marseille midfielder André Frank Zambo Anguissa were signed on a frantic deadline day. DFThree players who did well last season – Terence Kongolo, Florent Hadergjonaj and goalkeeper Jonas Lössl – made loan transfers permanent. German World Cup winner Erik Durm has arrived to strengthen left-back. The question is whether Huddersfield have added enough creativity much depends on how the young forwards Adama Diakhaby, Ramadan Sobhi and Isaac Mbenza perform. Paul DoyleInterest from Manchester United in Harry Maguire was headed off and means that, with the Turkish centre-back Caglar Soyuncu arriving on deadline day, the Foxes’ defence looks healthy. Jonny Evans, signed earlier in the summer, adds experienced competition. Riyad Mahrez departed but Claude Puel has added creativity in James Maddison and Monaco winger Rachid Ghezzal. Nick AmesA proposed £53m deal for Lyon playmaker Nabil Fekir collapsed before the World Cup and was never revived, but otherwise Liverpool enjoyed a hugely productive window. Jürgen Klopp’s midfield was strengthened with Naby Keïta and Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri will improve his attacking options and crucially, Klopp finally addressed his goalkeeping problems with the £65m signing of Alisson. AHIf it ain’t broke, why fix it? Even without the arrival of Riyad Mahrez, Pep Guardiola’s formidable squad was almost certainly strong enough to defend their title. City will trust Mahrez’s ability to thread those visionary passes in tight situations, and the winger could make the difference in Europe. Moreover, finally fit-again £50m full-back Benjamin Mendy will seem like a new signing. Louise TaylorExpect toys to be flung out of the pram and tears before bedtime. José Mourinho did not get Harry Maguire – or any of the centre halves he wanted in order to challenge City and Liverpool for the title. At least he made Fred a red and it will be intriguing to monitor the midfield relationship between the Brazilian and Paul Pogba. It needs to be better than that between Mourinho and Ed Woodward. LTExpect cries of “where’s the money gone” from Rafa Benítez as Newcastle ended the window showing a healthy profit on player dealings. Swansea centre half Federico Fernandez’s £6m deadline day move was necessary, selling Aleksandar Mitrovic for £22m is amazing business and Newcastle do look stronger than this time last year. Maybe, just maybe, a takeover beckons. LTMark Hughes has pruned his squad yet they finish the window stronger than they started it – especially after a late loan move for Danny Ings. Mohamed Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong should inject some pizzazz into what was becoming a tired squad, and the club have also signed goalkeeper Angus Gunn and centre-back Jannik Vestergaard. Hughes has also kept hold of James Ward-Prowse, Matt Targett, Alex McCarthy and Ryan Bertrand. BFDaniel Levy left it late again, but there was no last-gasp splurge from Tottenham this time. They became the first Premier League side not to sign a player in the summer window since its introduction in 2003, with Aston Villa unmoved by interest in Jack Grealish, and also failed to sell Toby Alderweireld, Mousa Dembéle and Danny Rose. JSWatford’s window started well, with a flurry of useful squad-strengthening activity and the permanent arrival of Gerard Deulofeu, but then turned very quiet, save for a late £1m move for Domingos Quina. The failure to sign a high-profile striker despite their evident need for one is puzzling, and overall the impression is of a club that has stood still. Simon BurntonWest Ham completed most of their business early, with Manuel Pellegrini in a hurry to make extensive improvements to his new side. They broke their transfer record to sign Felipe Anderson from Lazio, signed Ryan Fredericks and Jack Wilshere on frees, and finished a busy window by signing Lucas Pérez from Arsenal and Carlos Sánchez from Fiorentina. JSJoão Moutinho, Leander Dendoncker and Adama Traoré are the stand-out names from a frantic summer that also saw key players from their promotion season nailed down to permanent deals. Wolves have moved decisively although they arguably still lack a prolific forward – Raúl Jiménez will look to change that – and it was a big call to let set-piece specialist Barry Douglas join Leeds for what looks a cut-price fee.

She posts them to her Instagram. Here are a few of the best ones.Yann: “Alexandre and I met on Facebook through friends. We then talked on Skype for two months and we fell in love. Alexandre was kicked out of his house and he came to live with me and my family. My parents were not aware that we were in love or that I was gay. But my mother guessed it, because we were looking at each other lovingly. One day she searched my room and found all the letters we wrote each other. In my family, we don’t speak about our feelings. She had a hard time accepting it. The day she gave me her blessing, I immediately asked Alexandre to marry me. We got married two weeks ago. We are the second gay couple to get married in Elbeuf!” Alexandre: “I decided to take Yann’s last name. I am completely estranged from my family except for my father, but he died in April. I was brought up in a foster family who I’ve since taken to court for mistreatment. And when I finally went back to my mother’s house, she ended up throwing me out because I was gay. Today, I am at peace. With Yann, I feel confident. I love Yann’s body and his childish side. I am always doing little things for him, like every night, I pour him a bath with candles, and I bring him breakfast in bed. We want at least four children.”“At the time, there was no mixed couple in Dunkirk. One day, we even got arrested by the police because he is black. My mother rejected me and wanted to send me to a correctional facility. So I left home with nothing, just my purse. And when we wanted to get married, the first priest we asked refused, saying black people were like cockroaches. We’ve loved each other for 53 years. And people now fight to get into the Caribbean nights we organize!”“I was Jeanne’s neighbor. I lived right there, the fifth house on the right. When her husband died, I offered to help her mow her lawn. I was married with children and she had a little girl. I would address her in the formal form, ‘vous’. Nothing happened for 10 years. One day, I declared my love. And it happened. I left my house. Even after we had slept in the same bed for a month, I was still calling her ‘Madame Dufeutrel’. She died two months ago. She was the love of my life. In the morning, we would listen to the radio and dance together in the kitchen. I go to the cemetery every day to talk to her.”“He had the reputation of being a great charmer. All the girls wanted him. He would always go out with end-of-the-line duchesses, or dancers with long legs. I, on the other hand, was a tiny girl with no money. He made accessories for a circus company, and I was an equestrian performer. I would go naked on the horse’s back, stand on it, or ride sidesaddled. I fell in love with him because I wanted security. But it turned out to be the opposite: he harassed me mentally and physically, and denigrated me as an artist. I directed comedians and acrobats, but he would go behind my back to tell them my artistic direction was all wrong. He would break everything I did. “I started telling people what was going on, and no one helped me. They would say: ‘But you have such a strong character.’ We stayed together for 17 years until one day, he tried to strangle me with the canvas I was working on and throw me out the window. I left him. “What he did was about having power over my role as a woman and as an artist – but never as a mother, which is strange. Our son understood everything that was going on he was the one that would bring me a glass of water after my husband would choke me. “I think I’m an inveterate romantic. I could fall in love so easily. I would love to raise a second child. I have been given the green light to adopt one.”“I always have been very well-behaved and really good at school. I am an only child. I was always a loner and concentrated on my studies. No boys, no friends. Just my studies. “I went to the village fair. There, I saw a man leaning at the bar, drinking a beer. He was classy he was beautiful he had style. We talked for hours. I wanted to see him again. I found out where he lived and went to see him. We fell madly in love. I was 17. He was 55. “The problem when you are 17 and that you fall in love with an older man is that you ask yourself: do I have a psychological problem? Do I have an oedipal complex? “I had no experience. He was my first love. Months became years. “We kept our relationship secret. When I was off at university and he came to pick me up at the train station, I would hide in the trunk of his car so that nobody would see us. Until one day, I was walking hand in hand with Jean-Pierre in a nearby town, and I bumped into my father. My father said: ‘It’s easy. It’s either him or me. If it’s him, you take your stuff and I don’t want to see you anymore.’ I moved in with Jean-Pierre and didn’t see my father for seven years. I am younger than Jean-Pierre’s kids, but they’ve always accepted me. “At 25, I started feeling unwell. Breast cancer. Breast removal. Chemo. It’s metastatic cancer, meaning the cancer will always be there. It will never heal. I start receiving treatment. We open a restaurant. Two years later, my bones are hurting. And there it is: bone cancer. I start another round of treatment. Ever since I turned 27, there have been ups and downs. I’ve undergone intense chemo and I am in a trial program. Last year I almost died, and I told him, if I survive, let’s get married. I did. We got married in an old washhouse. I could die at any time. But there is this phrase that I’ve told myself ever since I got sick: ‘I have lived it’ – I have lived that love. That emotion with the person you love, that butterfly feeling in your stomach, that beating heart, that feeling of going to pieces or of being so strong. If you don’t feel that, what is life worth living for?”“I lost my wife last November. Her name was Marie-Jeanne. I met her at a village ball. We didn’t live in the same town, so I would write her letters all the time so we could meet up every weekend. I would talk to her about mundane things, if I had a cold, for instance. I would write that I kissed her tenderly. She was a simple girl just like me. A girl from the countryside. We were together for 47 years. I loved her.“Marriage is like a business. I built the house. She cooked and raised the children. One of them is mentally disabled. He lives in a special center. When they told him his mother had died, he cried. “I thought that when he would come back to the house, he would look for her everywhere, open the doors, like he used to do. But he didn’t. He didn’t ask for her. He knew. “She’s buried in the cemetery down the village. I still have to put her stone marker with her name, the year she was born and died. I am also going to add a little cross. “There are moments where I really get depressed, when I am really low. Oh la la, you can’t even imagine. I miss her. She was a good cook because she was from the Landes, where there are a lot of good cooks. “In the winter, we would watch television, then sit near the fire and fall asleep in our respective chairs. We were happy. I always hoped it would last forever. It didn’t. “Please forgive me if I cry.”“I named my cabin ‘The Villa of the Ones Deprived of Love’ because I was the least favorite child in my family. It used to be that in farmers’ families, there were maybe six children. They would send the one they loved the least out into the mountains to herd sheep. And that was my case. They had very obvious preferences – especially Mom. But moms do what they can. “How do you survive that? First, you have a terrible adolescence. It was endless. I was in pain. I was shy. It was not a place for teenagers. I would come back to the village once a week, get some bread and go back to the mountain with my donkey. I would miss everything: the balls, all the activities. “But then you adapt. And I was happy. I have dedicated my whole life to the sheep. And I don’t regret it at all. “I am not mad at my parents. “I have a daughter. She is 22. Until she turned 14, it was wonderful. Then, for some reason I can’t explain, she rejected me. We haven’t spoken in 10 years. I am really disappointed. “I don’t like humans. They are twisted. When I see what they are capable of, I am ashamed. I would have rather been a dog. That is why I work with animals. And I love waking up every morning. “I am with Katia now. She is from Paris. She is a good person. I met her when she was 17 and I was 25. She was my employee. She loved me, but it wasn’t reciprocal. I was with someone else at the time. And we spent 30 years without seeing each other. But we met again and we got married 10 years ago. I never got married with the others. Why? Because they didn’t ask. She just had an operation, so she is in Paris, resting. Do I love her? I don’t know. Love is a weird word. I care about Katia. That must be love. She cares about me too – a bit too much. “She is the one I should have kept when I was young, because we could have done things together. But I was too stupid at 25. We could have had babies together. I am about to retire but there is no one to replace me. If I had had kids with Katia, one of them could have taken over and I could have retired.“I am going to have to sell my flock. I haven’t found anyone to replace me.”“I have never had any partners in my life. I have never kissed a girl. “It sucks, because I am 24. “I am not sure why. My mother was depressed – she didn’t give me any hugs, she did not like to give warmth to other people, and so I got used to it. For me, hugging people was not very normal, and I didn’t feel very comfortable with it. “I was once kissed by a girl she made the move. I liked it, but it was uncomfortable for me. I was 15 and I didn’t really know what to do. She did everything – she could have kissed a plastic object and it would have been the same. “To give a kiss is a more symbolic thing than to have sex. I’m not sure if it has anything to do with romance. It’s a mind thing. One side of me wants to have this symbolic kiss with that one person, the mother of my children. And there is the other side, the animal side, of me that says: ‘Oh I don’t give a fuck, just go into the club and fuck ’em all.’ But then I don’t do it because the first side is just stronger. I am too sensitive. “I think girls want a dominant, strong type of guy, not the sensitive guy who is too emotional, like me. I am always overthinking things. “I want to love one person. “I think I have waited for too long, now. I am afraid to fail. I have a friend of mine who I fell in love with two years ago. I was like: ‘I like you a lot,’ and she said she liked me too, but she had another boy, and she’s not a polygamist. She did not break my heart – it’s more like I broke my heart, I had big expectations and put too much pressure on myself. I wrote her a poem. I was proud of it, but I’ve never gotten the chance to give it to her. “Most of the time, I am happy. I am sad in the evenings. It’s sad to be alone it would be nice to sleep and wake up next to somebody and be like: ‘Good morning, it’s grey outside.’”“I moved from Syria to France to become a biological pharmacist and a jazz singer. I was working in a lab and this guy calls me to open the door. I will always remember how he was dressed: grey jeans, a camel leather jacket, a beautiful bag that he had bought in Poland – very stylish, very minimalist – and sneakers. For a year, I wasn’t interested, and then it just hit me. I would walk through the halls to bump into him, and I finally asked him out.“I remember our first kiss. I was sleeping at the International House and he dropped me off with his scooter. I kissed him quickly on the lips and ran away. I was thinking: ‘I did it!’ He told me he drove so fast after that. Six months later, we moved in together. “Nicolas was a brilliant man, very intelligent, too intelligent. He pushed me to sing. He would always tell me things I had forgotten about myself. He knew me so well. He loved to organize special moments for his friends. He had a truck because he was a surfer. One day, he decided to organize a cheese fondue dinner party in the truck! “He got diagnosed with cancer on 21 June 2014.“He wanted a child. I didn’t want one. It was a difficult decision, but I came to realize that if anything were to happen to him, at least I would have a memory of him in our child. “It’s the best thing we could have done.

He came to my place the next day and he never left. “It wasn’t love at first sight with Thierry. His web profile was too perfect, and a lot of men had lied to me. He said he cooked he doesn’t. But he does do the cleaning. He tells me he loves me, that he thinks I am pretty. We can’t live without each other. It has been two years. “I want to do everything for him. All his problems are mine. I need to solve them. If I walk by him three times, I’ll kiss him at least once. I have never met a man who loves me like he does.“I will not blame him if it has to end. Because even if we only spend 10 years together, I know it will be intense and beautiful. I think life is worth it because I can give love. I don’t need to receive it.

The transferral of a long-in-the-tooth breakfast-show presenter to a grandfatherly mid-afternoon slot, his replacement a younger, female livewire.Or not quite. Sadly, it is not yet time to pass around the collection tin for John Humphrys: the news concerns the very mildest changing of the guard at Radio 6 Music. From 2019, Lauren Laverne will take over the breakfast show from Shaun Keaveny, who after 11 years (more than Moyles less than Wogan) moves to weekday afternoons, joined by news presenter Matt Everitt. Mary Anne Hobbs gets Laverne’s weekday mid-morning slot, and Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie nab Hobbs’ weekend breakfast gig.Otherwise, it’s a classic 6 Music cabinet reshuffle. It speaks to the station’s core contradiction: its remit is to “celebrate the alternative spirit in popular music from the 1960s to the present day” yet its presenters are all firmly establishment. The average age of its 22 DJs is 52. Only one is under 40 – Tom Ravenscroft, at 38. For all its praiseworthy emphasis on new music (apparently a key doubling-down of the reshuffle), 6 Music struggles to introduce new presenters because it relies on stable brands – largely pegged to the very white history of British indie culture – rather than minting new stars.Yet the station’s complacency makes a certain sort of sense: the lack of room for new talent indicates the success of 6 Music’s well-established brands. Note that Steve Lamacq, the station’s most popular broadcaster outside of the breakfast show, is the only untouched daytime slot. Rajar figures released in May show that 6 Music now attracts a record 2.53 million weekly listeners aged 15 and over (from 2.34 million in the previous quarter and 2.35 million last year), with all of the daytime shows reaching more than a million listeners weekly for the first time. Why fix what isn’t broken – especially when listeners baulk at change? Who can forget the horror at George Lamb’s short-lived show? Attempts at GLR-style quirk (Natasha Desborough on weekend breakfast, Jon Holmes at the weekend) were similarly brief.Clearly 6 Music’s remit is one the commercial sector can’t fill: Capital isn’t poaching their talent, nor the lad-centric Radio X, nor TV. Though that speaks as much to the problem as the positives. Like Radio 2, 6 Music is a cultural endpoint with no clear next step for the majority of its older presenters. It trades in comfort and familiarity, new versions of old sounds, rather than pursuing a genuine cultural “alternative spirit”. The “alternative” it celebrates is the mainstream – look no further than David Cameron’s  festival selfies for proof. In essence, 6 is the old Radio 1 evening slot writ large for people who, due to jobs and kids, can no longer listen to the radio between 7pm and midnight. Sloughing off older presenters would force listeners of a certain age to reckon with their identity – and mortality – and the fact that what was once their youthful alternative now simply … isn’t.It’s not just a problem for 6 Music but across all of culture – it always has been and it always will be. The station’s approach to change means that one day, millennials – no longer synonymous with “young people”, as agonising as that might be – will also find their youth preserved in aspic on a national radio station, a public service if ever there was one. That too will eventually be sent to the knacker’s yard – Stormzy and Mitski alike considered irredeemably washed – and death will soon beckon. If there’s any consolation, at this rate the immovable John Humphrys will still be going strong on Radio 4, ensuring an eternal flashpoint for youth’s unbridled rage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13ac1d6c95696bca81f141fd4036d15fe2f094c3/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84f055a94f095ac6b4d18bb3e2cbde8b","title":"im already stockpiling readers preparing for a messy brexit","story":"We hear from readers who have plans in place in case Britain runs out of food after a no-deal BrexitBritain could run out of food by this time next year if it cannot maintain the flow of goods after Brexit, the National Farmers’ Union has said. After it emerged that the government was drawing up plans to stockpile food in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British Retail Consortium and drug manufacturers issued more warnings about possible supply shortages, we asked for your views.About 300 readers got in touch, with more than half saying they had already started stockpiling or were seriously considering doing so, and the rest sharing their concerns about shortages after a no-deal Brexit. The most popular food items people wanted to store were staples such as flour, olive oil, dried pasta, rice, powdered milk, coffee and tinned items such as tomatoes and sardines. Many readers also highlighted “luxuries” such as chocolate, and there was mention of stocking up on over-the-counter medicines such as painkillers and antihistamines.Many respondents acknowledged that people would have to be in a relatively privileged position to be able to plan ahead. Here are some of your reasons for stockpiling and views on the practicalities of putting together an “insurance policy” in the larder.I am trying to do my best to avoid political rhetoric and look only at facts. While I still have faith that the people behind the politicians, the civil servants, industry leaders, lawyers and indeed the administrators of the EU are working hard to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the facts around reverting to WTO regulations leave me concluding that April 2019 could be a very sensible time to be self-sufficient, so I’m already stockpiling.My first purchase was an additional shelving rack for the garage and several plastic storage crates, to ensure the “Brexit supplies” are kept separately to everyday food. Each time I go to a supermarket, 2-3 times a week, I am doubling up on all non-perishable or long-date items and throwing a few extras into the trolley. So far I’ve bought mainly tinned goods: soup, different types of beans, tuna and sardines, chopped tomatoes. Also, jars of olives, capers and lots of dried pasta. I plan to spend around £100 a month until we know more about what might happen in March. The chest freezer will be filled with meat, but at the moment I’m looking to ensure we have the absolute basics rather than luxuries. I have also bought flour, yeast etc and will endeavour to learn to bake bread. I have bought ibuprofen, toothpaste and toilet paper as part of doubling up on non-perishable goods. In the event that food supplies are not affected, I will donate any stockpiled items to food banks. So far, my one “luxury” touch is three-packs of Boost chocolate bars at £1 each and with long dates.I am very worried about a no-deal Brexit, while also acknowledging that the chances of this are remote, despite what Liam Fox may publicly utter. I liken it to the tech billionaires who have bought up land in remote parts of New Zealand in case of global nuclear war: the probability is tiny, but the consequences are truly terrible, so it is worth a proportionately small investment in insulating oneself. Adam Roberts, 35, LeedsThere are too many people who seem to have forgotten about (or are too young to remember) the late 1970s and early 80s – 3 million unemployed, serious economic dislocation, and riots stemming from deprivation mixed with a simmering frustration and fury at an out-of-touch government.We also seem to have enough idiots at the helm who are quite willing to drive this country off an economic cliff-edge, knowing that they personally have good financial cushions to land on and who really aren’t bothered about the “collateral damage” they’ll inflict on others. Plus I don’t think they really understand the practicalities of how goods, including food, are distributed andor stored these days. I mean, what exactly is the government going to stockpile and where? I don’t believe this country has the capacity to stockpile any serious food supplies. David Bates, 54, BermondseySince the day of the advisory referendum I’ve been more keenly aware of the need to prepare, but what really kickstarted it was headlines about the government starting to stockpile. It comes down to a simple question: do I trust the government to take care of my family in the event of a crisis, or do we need to take responsibility ourselves? The way I see it, we still have a little time to get a head start on things.Even if nothing happens from Brexit, it’s handy to have a month or two’s supply of tinned food in the house in case we get snow like last year, or you’re ill or lose your job. There are plenty of situations where it’ll come in handy. The key is to only store what you enjoy eating, and actually use the stockpile, don’t just shove it in the shed and forget about it. I’ve got cartons of passata, tinned tuna, carrots, potatoes, onions, pulses, water chestnuts, plum tomatoes, curry paste jars, coconut milk, tomato puree, rice, pasta, water, orange juice, squash, spaghetti hoops, soups, stews, tinned fruit, herbs and spices. I’ve also got a good amount of DIY tools, buckets, lightbulbs, matches, candles, firewood, bleach, Dettol, first-aid items and common medicines. It’s an insurance policy of sorts. I recognise that I’m in a fairly privileged position to be able to do this: not everyone can afford a few hundred quid on unnecessary tins. But I have to look after my family, and I would encourage everyone else to do the same if they can. If you don’t end up needing it, you can eat it or donate to a food bank, because God knows they’ll need it. If you do need it, you’ll be glad of it. Thomas, ShrewsburySo far Brexit proceedings have been disastrous, in my opinion, and I fear we have not yet seen the worst of it. Food shortages will only be one of many trials ahead of us and I have already started to stockpile tinned food. I normally don’t use much, but any port in a storm.I’ve got tinned veg, fruit, pulses, corned beef, spam, sardines, salmon – things I could put a reasonably balanced meal together with. Cordon bleu it won’t be! Healthy? Not overflowing with vitamins, but not bad. I’m too young to remember rationing, but living in the north-east of England in the 50s was not a land of milk and honey – people bought bacon by the slice and butter by the ounce from the dearly beloved Co-operative Stores, which sold food loose from sacks and barrels. People nowadays couldn’t cope with that. If I have to, I’ll dig up my garden and grow my own fresh veg. Fresh fruit is what I would miss most of all, and you can’t stockpile that. Anne Neale, 62, CullercoatsI am making the assumption that most locally produced goods will be fine but anything that comes from further afield will not. So I am planning to buy a two- to three-month supply of staples – pasta, rice, flour, pulses. I assume that British milk will be just fine, but will probably buy some powdered milk and UHT just in case. I will buy additional supplies of canned fruit and tomatoes, tea and coffee.I have been thinking about buying a small chest freezer and running a cable down our small back garden to the shed so we can stock up on frozen veg – broccoli, green beans, spinach – as well as frozen berries, orange juice and fish (guessing Cornish mackerel and Scottish will not be affected, unless all the fishermen decide to move to Spain). We buy our veg from an organic veg co-op, so fingers crossed they will carry on with their UK box. Lettuce is not freezable, so l will grow my own! Victoria Whitford, LondonThis is less theoretical for me than for some – I have started stockpiling, just a couple of items every week. Although I of course hope the nonsense in parliament will resolve itself, and better yet Brexit will be stopped altogether, I have a young son to support and can’t afford to be caught up in the panic buying that will undoubtedly occur when a no-deal is near.So far I am buying tinned food including beans and tomatoes, rice and pasta, tinned fish and bottled water. I will also buy tinned meat. I hasten to add I’m not a “prepper”, I’ve never done this before in my life and never saw myself needing to do so. But my family is too important to me for me to take such a risk. I only wish the politicians would think in the same way. Ed, 33, GloucestershireWe’ve been considering stockpiling for a while as part of wider concerns about food supply chain disruption and as part of a drive to ensure that we lower our household waste, making us more resilient as a household. Brexit emerged as a final prompt as it appears to be a credible trigger, at least for short-term supply issues.I am most worried about Brexit disruption in the initial period, assuming a no-deal (food and medicine primarily), but longer-term I worry about the diminishing opportunities for my children in this country and an erosion of the standards and (some admittedly imperfect) safeguards on food, manufacturing, workers’ rights and environmental standards.I also worry about the effect Brexit is having on our culture – it feels as though the toxicity it has unleashed and the resurgence of the far right is far from played out. I don’t think stockpiling will in any way protect us from those longer-term and chronic issues. It provides a bit of a comfort blanket, but no real aid. I’m not panicking about Brexit but I am taking it seriously.

False choices and sloganeering must be avoided at all costs,” he said.In a report, published on Friday, the CBI argues that the nation’s needs are more complex than simply ensuring that the UK could attract the “brightest and best”.It calls for new rules for EU citizens to keep open the pipeline of migrant workers in all sectors including agriculture, hospitality, construction, the NHS and the creative industries and an easing of the policy for non-EU workers to give small businesses, unable to afford the visas or deal with Home Office red tape, a chance to plug any gaps arising from Brexit.“Openness and control must not be presented as opposites. Public attitudes towards migration and the impact it has on communities are far more nuanced,” said Hardie.The CBI’s report on immigration comes weeks after a cabinet split on post-Brexit immigration policy, with the former home secretary Amber Rudd’s plans to give EU citizens preferential treatment reportedly scrapped in June by her successor, Sajid Javid.The CBI report – Open and Controlled, A New Approach to Migration – concludes that a root and branch change is needed in Britain’s immigration approach following what it says was an “extensive” consultation with employers and trade associations representing 124,000 firms.It argues that May’s long-held immigration target of 100,000 migrants a year is not viable that rules on visas for non-EU workers are too expensive and too restrictive and a new EU citizens-only policy needs to be developed to keep the economy on the road.“Scrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration idend to support public services will add to public confidence,” said Hardie.“The building blocks of a successful new migration system for the UK begin with an honest and open debate that has been absent from politics. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Get it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the NHS, pick fruit or deliver products to stores around the country. This would hurt us all – from the money in our pockets to our access to public services.”While recognising that immigration “has also given rise to legitimate public concern about the pressure it creates on public services and on society”, the report says leaving the EU will mean “momentous change” for business which should be addressed properly by the government.Shifting the tone of the debate to focus on the positive benefits of migration will help build public trust, it says.The CBI argues that immigration has “delivered significant economic benefit to the UK” over the past 50 years and maintaining access to people and skills was “a high priority for business in the UK as it prepares to leave the EU”.The report reflects findings from research and surveys of 18 different sectors, one of the largest consultations of its kind. It says a pragmatic approach to migration will secure Britain’s future as a country open for business and foreign-inward investment.The CBI argues that simply extending the current approach to non-EU citizens to all migrants will be unworkable for business as the current tier-2 visa system involves a cap on numbers coming to Britain each month and is tilted in favour of higher earners.In April, Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, revealed he knew of at least 400 doctors who had been blocked from entering the UK to take up job offers because of the cap.It recommends registration for all EU citizens migrating to the UK following Brexit and to restrict their stay to three months unless they can prove they are working, studying or self-sufficient.This mirrors existing freedom of movement rules under EU law but would bring the UK into line with most other nations within the bloc by giving countries the means by which to monitor migration through registration.It also recommends that the government should reinstate controls on access to in-work benefits but continue to exempt EU workers from a health charge that applies to non-EU workers.It also wants the government to ringfence the rights of EU citizens to secure their place in the country in the event of no deal, echoing calls from campaigners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928af9349673772f79fb1ec195906363b5e5943f/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0df6c8cd1e39ee7408dfa15d6796ef66","title":"salt not as damaging to health as previously thought says study","story":"New research reignites a row with scientists who want to reduce salt intake to near zeroSalt may not be as damaging to health as is usually claimed, according to a controversial new study which suggests campaigns to persuade people to cut down may only be worthwhile in countries with very high sodium consumption, such as China.The World Health Organization recommends cutting sodium intake to no more than 2g a day – the equivalent of 5g of salt – because of the link to increased blood pressure, which is in turn implicated in stroke.But no country has ever managed to get population salt or sodium intake that low, the authors of the study published in the Lancet medical journal point out. Their research, the Canadian academics say, shows it may be pointless to try in countries like the UK and the US.The study by Prof Andrew Mente from the Population Health Research Institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University and colleagues is large, involving more than 90,000 people in more than 300 communities in 18 countries. But it immediately reignited a simmering row with other scientists who are on a crusade to reduce our salt consumption to near zero.Mente and colleagues found that the harmful effects of sodium – raised blood pressure and stroke – only occurred in countries like China, where the liberal use of soy sauce leads to sodium levels over 5g a day, the equivalent of 12g of salt. And they found that very low levels of salt actually led to more heart attacks and deaths, suggesting moderate salt intake may be protective.“Our study adds to growing evidence to suggest that, at moderate intake, sodium may have a beneficial role in cardiovascular health, but a potentially more harmful role when intake is very high or very low. This is the relationship we would expect for any essential nutrient and health. Our bodies need essential nutrients like sodium, but the question is how much,” said Mente.Two years ago, the same team published a study with similar results, also in the Lancet, looking at iniduals. It was lambasted by critics, who called it “bad science” and its findings were rejected by the American Heart Association.The latest observational study – not a randomised controlled trial which compares different groups of people – looks at communities rather than iniduals. It immediately came in for heavy criticism. The chief complaint was that it did not accurately measure the amount of sodium in people’s urine, which needs to be done over a 24 hour period.“The authors have not addressed any of the serious criticisms from the wider scientific community of their 2016 study,” said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, and founder of the salt-reduction campaign Cash (Consensus Action on Salt and Health). “These criticisms include the use of ill participants in the study, leading to reverse causality (ie those suffering with heart disease don’t eat much food, and consequently eat less salt, but it is the illness that leads to death rather than lower salt intake), and the use of spot urine measurements.”Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, said campaigns to lower salt intake have been beneficial in some countries. “Intakes of salt in the UK have fallen over the past 30 years from over 12g per day to 7 to 8g per day, and this has been accompanied by a fall in average blood pressure of the population. Japan used to have a very high prevalence of high blood pressure and high rates of stroke, and took action to cut salt intake in the 1970s and now has much lower rates,” he said.But it is not easy to persuade people to forgo salt, say Franz Messerli and Louis Hofstetter, experts from Switzerland and New York in a commentary on the Lancet findings. They cite Sir George Pickering, regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, who wrote more than half a century ago: “The rigid low-sodium diet is insipid, unappetising, monotonous, unacceptable, and intolerable. To stay on it requires the asceticism of a religious zealot.”The new study measured potassium as well as sodium levels in people’s urine and found that higher potassium, which is found in fruit and vegetables, cut rates of stroke, heart disease and death. “Perhaps salt-reduction evangelists and salt-addition libertarians could temporarily put aside their vitriol and support the hypothesis that diets rich in potassium confer substantially greater health benefits than aggressive sodium reduction,” they write."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253304808496e8ffb1c03a10849651f86ef54edb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1e2e11e089c0e0497eaa183404d7db","title":"blue light from phone screens accelerates blindness study finds","story":"Light from digital devices triggers creation of toxic molecule in the retina that can cause macular degenerationScientists say they have found how blue light from smartphones, laptops and other digital devices damages vision and can speed up blindness.Research by the University of Toledo in the US has revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light triggers poisonous molecules to be generated in the eye’s light-sensitive cells that can cause macular degeneration – an incurable condition that affects the middle part of vision.Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and more energy compared with other colours, can gradually cause damage to the eyes.Dr Ajith Karunarathne, an assistant professor in the university’s department of chemistry and biochemistry, said: “We are being exposed to blue light continuously and the eye’s cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it.“It’s no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye’s retina. Our experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.”It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells, in the retina.Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, it can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set off a chain of reactions that leads to toxic molecules being created in the photoreceptor cells.Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: “If you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.“Photoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they’re dead, they’re dead for good.”The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cells.Karunarathne said: “The retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.”The scientists found that a molecule called alpha-tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.Karunarathne said: “That is when the real damage occurs.”For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Up to 15 English councils are at risk of going bust, according to the National Audit Office, and councils are increasingly moving to “bare minimum” levels of service.On Wednesday the Northampton South Tory MP, Andrew Lewer, said ministers needed to urgently “learn the lessons” from the financial collapse of Northamptonshire county council if they were to prevent more councils slipping into insolvency.The details of the cuts faced by Northamptonshire are likely to emerge over the next few weeks, with the “radical” reductions expected across all areas, from social care to roads maintenance. It is likely there will be large-scale redundancies among the council’s 3,400 staff.In children’s services, where spending has been particularly high, the council is likely to find ways of controlling the surge in the numbers of children being taken into care or subject to a child protection plan in recent years.Adult social care will also come under scrutiny, and it is likely the council will look to raise or introduce fees and charges for services. Support for people with learning disabilities will also come under scrutiny.Eligibility thresholds for free home-to-school transport for young people are likely come under review, although any restrictions could prove unpopular in a largely rural county, and could be subjected to judicial review.There will be pressure on the council to go ahead with its plan to close or sell off 21 out of its 36 libraries, although this is currently subject to legal challenge. The council will look also at reducing road repair and winter gritting services.Northamptonshire will attempt to renegotiate contracts with private suppliers, including a number of private finance initiative agreements. It will attempt to sell off more council-owned buildings.Labour abstained from an earlier council vote to accept a section 114 report from the council’s finance director, which warned that huge cuts were needed to balance the books. Labour said it would not vote to “harm the people of Northamptonshire”.The council is technically insolvent, having received two section 114 letters – effectively saying the council cannot meet its financial obligations – in the past six months. There have been only two other such notices in the whole of England since 1988.The latest section 114 notice, issued in July by the finance director, Mark McLaughlin, criticised the council’s leadership over the past four years, saying it had taken poor decisions and failed to tackle the growing black hole in its finances.It said the council had inappropriately used reserves and cash from the sale of buildings to fix day-to-day revenue problems, and had adopted savings plans it knew were unachievable on the assumption it would be bailed out by government.Meeting the challenge of balancing the budget would “require a depth of insight, perspective and leadership” that had not been apparent in the council’s previous budget deliberations, the letter said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80136800b48b51a309b4e7b12efd44ba49ecaf20/444_0_4262_2557/master/4262.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78590c4ed76a41b9665d1ebd453aad42","title":"adam peaty fourth gold medal european championships medley relay","story":"• Peaty leads off GB team in 4x100m medley relay• Britain’s Ben Proud takes gold in 50m freestyleA hat-trick of quadruples or a fourpeat times three. Whichever terminology, it illustrates the mutual affection between Adam Peaty and the European Championships that concluded on Thursday in Glasgow with the Olympic champion collecting his fourth gold in the 4x100m medley relay.Add in a world record as the cherry on top of his endeavours and the 23-year-old has erased any doubts his dominance was in peril following the end of his four-year winning streak at the Commonwealth Games in April. Unbeatable again, and unrelenting, it has been a strident statement of intent as the season ends and ambitions switch towards the world championships next summer in South Korea and the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.“Sometimes you get too caught out in the outcomes,” said Peaty, who linked up with James Guy, Nick Pyle and Duncan Scott for Great Britain’s victorious time of 3min 30.44sec with Russia and Germany landing silver and bronze. “That’s why people were saying there’d be world records as soon as I did the heats. I got four golds but I wanted to focus on the process and take each gold medal as it comes.“Even though I was a bit slower here, I knew I had to go out fast. I knew I had to spook them. That’s what sport is about: using your head, using your tactics. It’s not always about posting the fastest times in the world. Sometimes it’s down to the race and getting the best out of yourself and the worst out of someone else.”Ben Proud was also golden, winning the 50m freestyle in 21.34sec. Disappointing, he said, the mark of a perfectionist after recording the third‑quickest time in history in qualifying for the final.“Looking at the competition it was a good enough swim to get my hand on the wall first but I can’t be doing that in major championships. I am very happy with 21.11 last night and I guess 21.3 is fast enough to win the gold but when I have to go against the rest of the world that’s not going to be fast enough.”Max Litchfield continued to rebound from the shoulder injury that kept him out of the Commonwealth Games by taking silver in the 400m inidual medley behind Hungary’s Daniel Verraszto. There was a second place also for Imogen Clark in the 50m breaststroke with her time of 30.34sec outside her UK record from the semi-finals as she trailed Russia’s Yuliya Efimova.She was one of several breakthrough performers with the 18-year-old Holly Hibbott winning bronze in the 400m freestyle and Freya Anderson, one year her junior, rounding off her own graduation into the senior ranks by teaming up with Georgia Davies, Alys Thomas and Siobhan-Marie O’Connor for bronze in the last event, the women’s 4x100m medley, won by Russia.With Guy also landing 100m butterfly bronze, it left GB second to Russia in the table with 24 medals: nine golds, seven silver and eight bronze. Many of the older faces kept delivering. New faces revealed themselves.“You see how some of them are fearless and maybe in four years’ time, some of them will be standing here with four gold medals as well,” Peaty said. “Some of them are only 17 or 18. It proves now we’re not just a Generation Z. You have the back-up coming through for Tokyo and beyond. Hopefully, I can lead a good team into Tokyo.”Jack Laugher will chase a third European ing gold in Edinburghon Friday in the 3m springboard synchronised event tandem with Chris Mears after winning the 3m springboard competition.

It’s a different type of training. It doesn’t really involve a ball or too much running, but it’s a lot of explosive stuff, a lot of surfing and being out on the water,” he said. “You need time off but you’re only going to get a short pre-season after a tour so you need to make sure you’re in good shape.”After falling out of favour with England following a breakthrough 2008 campaign, Cipriani moved to Australia but set about winning his place back upon joining Sale in 2012. And having finally done so, he concedes hanging on to it is an altogether different challenge.“You’ve seen me for the last six seasons – I’ve been hungry and my focus hasn’t changed at all,” he said. “Is it dangerous to have got something tangible? Is it better to be in the chasing pack, or is it better to be in the pack, to try to go forward?“My philosophy hasn’t changed I’m trying to become a better rugby player and I’m in the right place to keep learning and play well. I’ve got back in, right now I’m in there and I’ve got to do everything I can to stay there.“I’ve trained myself over the last six years to focus on training tomorrow and focus on what’s happening in the next week. I take the view that I have to keep performing in every single game to have even a chance of reaching that end goal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/188973995c5f6ffddf2a20f92aa31ab4a1e3fc78/0_261_3102_1861/master/3102.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff607056914928beb35fcec062aefcb","title":"england ed smith dawid malan india washout","story":"Ed Smith is looking to create a pool of England Test players who can offer a range of options both home and away as he offered a more detailed explanation of the decision to drop Dawid Malan.The national selector spent two hours with Malan on Wednesday discussing the reasons for the 30‑year‑old batsman’s omission from the second Test against India here. The first day was washed out without a ball bowled or the toss taking\u0026nbspplace.Malan, who has been replaced by the 20-year-old Ollie Pope, averaged 27 from 15 Tests but showed significant competence on the bouncier pitches of Australia during the Ashes defeat, top-scoring for England and hitting a fine maiden century in Perth.England’s official squad announcement on Sunday included the eyebrow-raising line from Smith that “it may be that his game is better suited to overseas conditions”. But the national selector insists this should be taken as a source of encouragement, rather than a slight, with squads in future set to be more tailored towards inidual abilities.“I spent a couple of hours with him face to face and the message is very simple: he has had a full calendar year of Test cricket and he knows where he is at. He has shown he can play very well at Test level with that excellent 140 at Perth.“Moving forward we talked about how his strengths could come into play but in no way did I mean that line as an implicit criticism. He has scored 10,000 first-class runs in England and shown he can play well on different surfaces.“But, in an England shirt, one of the things he has done distinctively is play very well in very alien conditions, so I wanted to reaffirm to him that one of the things we are looking at is having the right players for the right conditions, which is not horses for courses. I bridle at that, because you wouldn’t play someone who can only play well at one ground – that is not going to happen. We are not interested in going back to picking one player for one Test.”The washout which was confirmed at 4.50pm and left the England and Wales Cricket Board needing to refund around £2m of tickets through its insurance.

But having spent the best part of three weeks training at altitude in St Moritz the 25-year-old believes she is back to her best.“I’ve no fears at all with my achilles now,” she said. “It was a little bit irritated this summer but having massages at the camp helped. I’ve not missed any training so it’s really good. The hay fever is fine, too – there wasn’t any pollen up in St Moritz at all. It’s nice to be here feeling well.”Muir does not have particularly fond memories of the European Championships, having been dumped out in the first round in Zurich four years ago. “I was third on times going into Zurich and I didn’t make the final. Now I’m a completely different athlete both physically and mentally – I’ve improved so much in both those areas.“I have always been shy as a person and I’m a lot more confident than I was before. I wasn’t used to being in the spotlight and having that pressure to do well. I maybe let the pressure get to me a little bit and it’s taken me a few years to learn how to deal with it and perform.“I’ve overcome that hurdle now and take it all in my stride and always perform better with that pressure. I’ve gone from not making the final to hopefully winning the championship. It’s crazy how far you can come in four years but I’m really proud of myself.”During the past two years Muir has set a number of British and European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m, and won bronze and silver medals at the world indoor championships in March.But she has never won an outdoor medal even though she came mighty close at the 2015 and 2017 world championships and 2016 Olympics.The 1500m in London last year was particularly heartbreaking, with Muir close to tears after missing out on a bronze medal by seven-hundredths of a second to South Africa’s Caster Semenya.She insists that failure has only inspired her to strive for more success. “I think about it every now and again but if anything it’s driven me to work even harder,” she said.“I’ve always worked hard but it’s given me that extra motivation to get on the podium on the outdoor stage and these championships present that opportunity.“I’ve proved myself indoors but outdoors the medals have been stuck on delay. So it would be great to win that title. That would be a big confidence booster ahead of next year.”Muir also admits the absence of Sifan Hassan, the pre-race favourite who has elected to run only the 5,000m, makes her chances even better. “It will open things up because she is one of the best athletes in the world,” Muir said.“We’ve raced each other a lot and the head to head is close. But there is no extra pressure. I’m relaxed, and if I’m relaxed I perform well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aae9a19a6b46065ecd9820c3d1ca93981c697a4c/18_96_5264_3159/master/5264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=201a44a4e437759e9385900aa5a5c121","title":"tiger woods us pga championship rickie fowler","story":"• Woodland surprise leader by one shot after shooting 64• Woods ends with level-par 70 after poor startAs Rickie Fowler delivered his latest statement of major championship intent Tiger Woods provided a reminder of the attribute that once made him so dominant in the same environment. Talent, after all, is nothing without fortitude.At the position of three over par after two holes Woods was in danger of being a US PGA footnote. His latest tournament obituary was being penned.Often lost in discussion of the 42-year-old’s remarkable career is his ability to scrap like a seasoned street fighter. Woods retrieved all of his shots before signing for a level‑par 70 that will have him glancing towards the leaders on Friday as opposed to fearing a missed cut.“It kept me in the tournament,” Woods said of his recovery. “I could have easily gone the other way, being three over through two. A lot of things could happen, not a lot were positive but I hung in there and turned it around. I was able to grind out a score.”His determination was typified on the 15th, his 6th. Having found dense shrubbery twice he played a chip to within 3ft of the cup to save par. Rory McIlroy’s drive, clean approach and two putts appeared bland in comparison.Fowler has been in this position many times. An opening round of 65 was notable for his accuracy as the 29-year-old hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation. By close of play, Fowler had been headed by Gary Woodland’s 64. There was an element of surprise to that Woodland has no top 10s in his last 27 major appearances.If, as has been widely mooted, the course layout in Missouri more resembles a standard PGA Tour event than a major then Fowler has great cause for hope.He is yet to win one of the big four but has far less trouble converting promise into tangible reward on standard tour weeks.Cruel history, including at this event in 2014 when he was denied by McIlroy, has taught him not to look far ahead.“I’m definitely happy but on Thursday you can’t win the tournament, you can definitely take yourself out of it and lose it, so we took care of what we needed to take care of today and we move on,” Fowler said.Ian Poulter has the same aspiration as Fowler in seeking to crown years of eminence with a major triumph. His 67 kept the dream firmly alive. After a spell in Europe and having seen the dismal weather forecast for St Louis in the early part of this week, Poulter arrived a day before competitive action started.Deep emotion would be attached to a Jason Day victory. The Australian was rocked by the pre-tournament news that his close friend and compatriot Jarrod Lyle had died from leukemia at the age of 36. Lyle and Day began competitive careers in the United States at the same time.“I received a text about Jarrod. It’s hard because you sit there, you know him, he’s a buddy of yours and he’s not there anymore,” Day said after his 67. “He’s never going to come back. That’s the hardest thing to sort of come by.“I lived across the street from him when we first started out in Orlando. He was a good buddy of mine. It’s heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and two kids.”McIlroy matched Woods’s score. The third member of this marquee group, the defending champion, Justin Thomas, is one under. McIlroy missed a series of opportunities to produce a better score but railed against the widely held notion that Bellerive is there to be butchered.“I didn’t hear any of that from the players,” he said. “That’s from people that aren’t playing in the tournament, that haven’t played the course and they really don’t know.”McIlroy wore a protective strapping on his right arm but played down any suggestion of a serious problem.There was a denial, too, from the PGA of America regarding the tournament being affected by the hacking of the association’s computer files. The hack was accompanied by a ransom demand via a bitcoin address in the same week Tommy Fleetwood’s Open winnings were paid into someone else’s bank account.The European Tour got the wrong Tommy Fleetwood. It used to be such a simple game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e45885240053a7681a87a16596ffd78ec13e122/0_203_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c22f52ac64d1a01c8625fe99e7eb7b33","title":"ad libido review taking female pleasure into her own hands","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghFran Bushe’s comedy uses glitter and smart songs to advocate better understanding of sex for womenFran Bushe wants to fix sex. Armed with glitter, songs and a diagram of her vulva, she’s on a mission to kickstart her own libido and change how we think and talk about female pleasure – and its opposite – in the bedroom. After trying and failing to enjoy sex for 15 years and facing a parade of unhelpful advice from GPs, Bushe is taking matters into her own hands.Though, of course, it’s not that simple. Bushe wants a quick fix, a happy ending, but much of her solo show is about how life – and sex – don’t work that way. At least not in the sexually unequal society we still live in. Ad Libido is unapologetically personal, to the extent of including intimate snippets from Bushe’s teenage diary, yet it also lightly suggests the external pressures that many women feel when making decisions about sex. Often throughout Bushe’s quest it becomes as much about soothing the feelings of male partners as trying to make sex pleasurable for herself.All of this is surprisingly funny. There are hints of Bryony Kimmings’ solo work in the irreverent approach to exposing subject matter, though Bushe also injects the piece with her own distinct brand of humour, from dolphin gags to talking vaginas. The DIY charm of the glitter curtains and overhead projector belies the sophistication of the show’s construction, which makes serious points using silly means. This is perhaps clearest in the songs, which combine knowing absurdity with smart and audacious rhymes. Bushe’s sharp musical skewering of a male friend’s offer to cure her with his sexual prowess is particularly entertaining.In a world in which studies on viagra vastly outnumber research into female sexual dysfunction and two thirds of heterosexual women report being sexually unsatisfied, this is implicitly a campaigning piece. Bushe wants all of us – women and men – to start talking honestly about what happens between the sheets. We as a culture might be finally beginning to have more sophisticated conversations about consent, but Ad Libido makes it clear that we need to go further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f44e7d47a8126e3f30352a24d2d5e314c3dcde/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2edfad96b41de0c9f7272baa5fd19bcc","title":"from virgin to tesla why companies go cool on public ownership","story":"There are many reasons why entrepreneurs get frustrated by the demands of the marketsElon Musk’s announcement that he was considering taking Tesla off the stock market should not have been a total surprise.If Musk goes through with his plan he will join a long line of entrepreneurs who have floated their businesses only to become frustrated by the demands of running a public company. Virgin’s Richard Branson, Hugh Hefner of Playboy and Michael Dell of the computer maker have all taken their companies private in the belief that they would fare better out of the glare of the markets.Other well-known brands taken private by founders after a spell as a public company include Iceland, Caffè Nero and Matalan – but Tesla is of a completely different scale and would require Musk raising tens of billions of dollars in funding.The main reasons for taking a company private include:A public company is just that – owned by external investors – mainly through pension and other investment funds that buy shares. Management therefore has to be publicly accountable and subject to scrutiny by investors and in the press. Most chief executives accept that attention but some company founders resent being in the spotlight. After Virgin floated in 1986 Richard Branson, an extrovert when it comes to marketing his products, never warmed to the task of explaining his finances and decisions to the City and two years later he took Virgin private again.The City and Wall Street face regular criticism for demanding constantly rising profits and not thinking enough about a company’s long-term health. If a publicly listed company’s targets are missed, the share price reaction can be swift and punishing. Explaining his thinking to Tesla employees, Musk said: “As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term.”Musk’s view echoes that of many entrepreneurs who have floated their companies and thought better of it. Since reversing his decision to take Virgin public in the 1980s, Richard Branson has often criticised institutional investors for demanding quick returns instead of investing for the long term. Malcolm Walker, Iceland’s founder, has said a profit warning in 2001 would have been treated as a blip if the company had been privately owned but that as a public company it was seen as a disaster. Iceland returned to private ownership in 2005 with Walker at the helm. “Now we’re a private company once again I don’t give a shit what the City thinks,” he said in 2010. “It’s not ‘how will it affect profits?’ it’s ‘will it be right for the business?’ Bugger the profits. The profits sort themselves out.” Once a company’s shares are publicly traded its management has to report results up to four times a year to be pored over by analysts at investment banks and fund managers who hold the shares. Many chief executives despise analysts but are savvy enough to hide their irritation. Musk, on the other hand, has grown increasingly tetchy with analysts’ questions about Tesla’s finances. In May he complained about “boring bonehead questions” and took a question from a YouTuber instead of answering a detailed query. “These questions are so dry they’re killing me,” he explained. On his next analyst call, on 2 August, Musk apologised to the people he was rude to. A private company can have anyone it wants on the board but public companies require directors who are more or less independent and can represent the interests of wider investors. Public companies are under increasing pressure to increase the ersity of boards and for directors to challenge management on strategy, pay and other matters. That can be frustrating for entrepreneurs who believe they know best and that the company is still their baby. When Matalan’s founder, John Hargreaves, took his budget retail chain private in 2006 one of his non-executive directors said: “He was a fish out of water trying to run a FTSE company with corporate governance.”Investor short-termism can be frustrating for entrepreneurs in the best of times. But if the company needs a major overhaul there is more temptation for its founder to say goodbye to critical scribblers. Michael Dell led a $25bn private equity-backed buyout of Dell in 2013, saying the company he founded in 1984 needed room to invest in better products and rebuild for the cloud computing age. The single-mindedness required to build a business from scratch often rubs up badly against the legal constraints and governance standards of a public company. Musk is an extreme example. No orthodox chief executive would tweet abuse at a er who had helped save the lives of boys trapped in a flooded cave as Musk did. But a founder with a big stake in a public company will almost always be frustrated by the processes and limits of a public company. When Sports Direct floated in 2007 some commentators questioned whether Mike Ashley, who opened the company’s first shop in 1982, was suited to public markets. Ashley has run the company more like a private enterprise, employing relatives, holding management meetings in the pub and buying stakes in rival companies. Despite recurring speculation, Ashley has insisted he has no plans to take the company private."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4389e0b0c07a3c7976b5d1470d1936fa403634e2/0_476_5694_3417/master/5694.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6f0d19cc328a12718a06c04cd556ae","title":"samsung launches galaxy note 9 big screen larger battery bluetooth stylus camera","story":"Top-of-the-range Android smartphone has new Bluetooth stylus and intelligent dual camera system with dual aperture lensesSamsung’s latest flagship Android smartphone is the productivity-focused Galaxy Note 9: a larger, longer-lasting version of its stylus-touting phablet.Announced at an event in New York the Note 9 resembles last year’s Note 8, replete with glass front and back, curved edges and slide-out S Pen stylus.The 6.4in Quad HD+ Super AMOLED screen is slightly bigger than last year’s model.

The game has been available on Apple’s iOS devices since April, as well as traditional consoles and computers, and will eventually be available directly via Epic’s website for other Android devices. Fortnite is also now available on Samsung phones from the Galaxy S7 on.The new and improved S Pen stylus, a selling point of the Note series, now connects to the phone via Bluetooth so that it can also be used away from the device, for activating the camera shutter or similar. It still fits neatly into the bottom of the phone, however, and comes in a range of contrasting colours depending on the colour of the phone.A dual 12-megapixel camera system matching that on Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, including its variable aperture lens and a 2x optical zoom camera, is mounted in the back of the Note 9. New also is an intelligent camera system that uses AI to perform object recognition and detect blinks, notifying the user immediately if a shot is blurry or any other issues.Below the camera is a repositioned fingerprint scanner which, like the Galaxy S9+, is now lower down the back and therefore should make it a lot easier to use.Laura Simeonova, an analyst covering mobile phones and IoT for CCS Insight, said that while the Note’s hardcore, loyal fan base will see the new features as enticing, “Samsung will be wary of comparisons with the launch of the S9 portfolio and accusations of less underwhelming improvements on previous models.“It remains to be seen whether these will be enough to impress those outside the fiercely loyal Note user base.”The Note 9 will also be able to use Samsung’s Android-on-a-desktop mode called DeX, as with the Korean firm’s more recent top-end smartphones, but without the add-on dock, instead simply requiring a cable plugged into the bottom of the phone and into a monitor.The phone will come in four colours: black, blue, grey and purple. It will ship with Android 8.1 Oreo, not the recently released Android 9 Pie, and it will be available with either 128GB of storage costing £899 or 512GB of storage for £1,099. Pre-orders start today and will ship on 24 August.“Some of the new features such as the new version of Dex combined with the S-Pen’s remote control functionality for presentations, should continue to catch the attention of business users and enterprises beyond the Note’s current consumer base,” said Simeonova. “The device will be available from 24 August, which is likely to give it over a month before we see any new iPhones or the new Pixel devices from Google slated for October 2018.”Samsung also launched an updated smartwatch, called the Galaxy Watch, and a smart speaker called the Galaxy Home powered by the company’s own Bixby voice assistant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1979edc14fe1582768a5b1fc9cac0597498e41d5/303_582_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86407751d77c520a490d64ab951c3589","title":"best gaming pc under 1000 pounds","story":"BML wants to buy her son a gaming PC that will also be good for school work, but doesn’t want to pay over the oddsMy son has an Xbox but would like a gaming computer. I would like a PC that he can use for his school work. He is starting his GCSEs this year. I don’t want to spend more than £1,000. Could you recommend something which will do both jobs? BMLPC manufacturers love the gaming market, which is growing strongly and worth more than $30bn a year. Most PCs outperform their users, and the processor goes to sleep between keystrokes. Gamers, by contrast, never have enough power, and will pay more for better performance. This translates into higher prices and better profit margins. They also like cases that look like props from science-fiction movies.You will also need to buy a monitor, but your son will be able to use it with his games PC and his Xbox, liberating the family TV set. He will also be able to use it for schoolwork, and for many other purposes including VR and movie editing.There are lots of good gaming laptops, led by the Asus ROG (Republic of Gamers) range and MSI (Micro-Star International), with Gigabyte among the interesting challengers. The main drawbacks are that gaming laptops are expensive and most of them are not really portable.Desktops have several advantages over laptops. First, you get more power for less money, partly because they can run hotter, faster processors. Second, they are easier to upgrade. If you don’t have the budget for a top-of-the-range PC, you can add more memory and – most importantly – a faster graphics card later. Third, as I never tire of repeating, desktops have better ergonomics and are better for your health.Fortunately, all the largest Windows PC manufacturers now offer off-the shelf gaming PCs at reasonable prices. HP and Dell got into the market early by taking over specialist suppliers. Dell bought Alienware in March 2006. HP responded by buying Voodoo in September 2006. Lenovo belatedly entered the market in 2015 with its Y Series laptops and desktops, adding Razer Editions to get the attention of serious gamers.HP, Dell and Lenovo are now the world’s three largest PC suppliers. They have huge buying power, economies of scale, and wide distribution. You can probably find at least one of their systems locally at John Lewis, Currys PC World or Argos. In fact, Argos offers 106 gaming PCs – half of them desktops – which illustrates the strength of the marketThere’s not a lot to choose between them, as you’ll get much the same parts. Your son may have a preference, based on appearance or street cred, while you should look at service and support options.Until recently, the quad-core Intel Core i7-7700 was the processor of choice for gaming, with the Core i5-7400 as the less powerful but cheaper option. They have now been replaced by two six-core chips, the i7-8700 and the i5-8400. Any of these four should be fine.The minimum memory requirement is 8GB, and it’s generally enough. However, 16GB is popular and 32GB is usually an option.Serious graphics cards start with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050Ti, which has its own 3GB or 4GB of fast memory. After that you can climb through the 1060, 1070 and 1080 models with 6GB or 8GB of memory, before getting into dual graphics cards that cost more than most PCs. AMD’s Radeon RX 570 and RX 580 are also good upgrades, but not as common.When it comes to storage, my recommended minimum is a 128GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD for the boot disk plus a 1TB traditional hard drive for storage. Serious gamers usually want bigger SSDs, from 256GB to 1TB.One money-saving alternative is a Seagate FireCuda (PDF), which packages some Flash memory with a traditional hard drive. Another is adding 16GB of Intel Optane memory. Both are better than having a solitary hard drive.If there’s a choice of power supply, 400W-500W is good, with 850W and similar options for high-end and dual graphics cards.If you shop around, get as close to this spec as you can …Remember, you can play games on almost any PC. When you buy a games machine, you’re paying extra for things like high-resolution graphics, shadows and lighting effects, a high frame-rate, and fast response times. You can tune different games to your PC’s performance or use quick settings such as low, medium, high and ultra. Higher settings provide more realistic images but lower frame-rates. There’s an excellent YouTube video that uses Deus Ex: Mankind Divided to illustrate the differences.It’s probably a good sign of a competitive market that I couldn’t find any real bargains, even at Argos. Lower prices generally turned out to involve compromises such as shipping a slower SSD or none at all, fitting a FireCuda drive, or reducing the graphics card’s memory and so on.I spent my own money on an i5-8400 when it came out last year, and I still can’t see a better alternative for gaming at less than £1,000.Have you got a question?

If successful it would become the first new branch of the armed services to be created since 1947.However, any proposal to create a new service would require congressional action and is likely to come under close scrutiny, especially from Democrats.To prepare for the new force, Pence announced that the administration would put together an elite squad of service members to fight wars in space, known as the Space Operations Force and drawn from all parts of the military like the existing special forces.There will also be a United States Space Command, which will develop doctrine and tactics for fighting wars in space.And the administration plans to create an assistant secretary of defense for space, a position that would eventually turn into a head of the independent Space Force.The defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has endorsed plans to reorganize the military’s current space-war fighting forces and create a new command, but has previously opposed launching an expensive separate new service. But he said this week he was in agreement with the White House.Retired astronaut Capt Mark Kelly called the proposed space force a “dumb idea”, saying it would duplicate work already done by the air force.“There is a threat out there, but it’s being handled by the US Air Force today. It doesn’t make sense to build a whole other level of bureaucracy,” he told MSNBC. Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz said Republicans were too afraid to tell the president the idea was a bad one. “Although ‘Space Force’ won’t happen, it’s dangerous to have a leader who cannot be talked out of crazy ideas,” the Democrat tweeted. But Alabama representative Mike Rogers said he was “thrilled” with the announcement. “We in the House have been warning for years about the threats to our space assets and the unacceptably slow pace to develop more capable space systems,” he said.Pence said the White House is already talking to congressional leaders about getting the new branch approved.“America will always seek peace, in space as on earth, but history proves that peace only comes through strength. And in the realm of outer space, the United States Space Force will be that strength in the years ahead,” he said.

While the rate of women who gave birth addicted to opioids in Hawaii matched the national average, the rate increased 53-fold in West Virginia.“These findings illustrate the devastating impact of the opioid epidemic on families across the US, including on the very youngest,” said Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Untreated opioid use disorder during pregnancy can lead to heartbreaking results. Each case represents a mother, a child and a family in need of continued treatment and support.”The report, compiled by the CDC, jibes with other research which has shown a disturbing rise in infants exposed to drugs and forced to withdraw at birth. It may also reflect a greater awareness of the condition among doctors, researchers warned.Between 1999 and 2014, researchers found that the number of mothers who went into labor at a hospital with an opioid addiction increased from 1.5 mothers per 1,000 deliveries to 6.5 per 1,000.The new government data comes from a subset of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Cost Utilization Project, called the National Inpatient Sample. Only 28 states report to the project. Nevertheless, every state that had more than three years of data showed an increase in the number of mothers addicted to opioids at delivery.States with the highest increases each year were Maine, New Mexico, Vermont and West Virginia. The lowest increases were in Hawaii and California.In Vermont, the rate of women who presented with an opioid addiction increased 97-fold, from 0.5 cases per 1,000 in 2001 to 48.6 in 2014. In West Virginia, the rate increased 53-fold, from 0.6 cases in 2000 to 32.1 in 2014.Comparatively, in 2000 in Hawaii, 0.6 women per 1,000 went into labor addicted to opioids. In 2014, that rate increased to 2.4 women per 1,000. That is still a four-fold increase over 14 years, but far below Vermont’s 2014 rate.“Even in states with the smallest annual increases, more and more women are presenting with opioid use disorder at labor and delivery,” said Dr Wanda Barfield, director of the CDC’s ision of reproductive health. “These state-level data can provide a solid foundation for developing and tailoring prevention and treatment efforts.”Researchers believe, in part, regional variation is reflective of opioid-prescribing trends. In West Virginia, doctors wrote 138 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people in the state in 2012. That could later translate to high rates of women addicted to opioids when they give birth.Further, steep increases have forced doctors to rethink how they provide care for such infants. On average, infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome stay in the hospital for 17 days, according to a recent review in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).But their mothers are frequently released. That means mothers who go into labor addicted to opioids are often struggling not only with addiction, but with how to visit their infants that remain in the hospital.Further, while untreated addiction can powerfully affect families, so can opioids prescribed for treatment. Many infants born to women in treatment on so-called replacement therapies, such as methadone and buprenorphine, will also suffer neonatal abstinence syndrome, according to NEJM. Replacement therapies are widely accepted as the most effective means of treating opioid addiction.While all available data shows the problem is widespread, gaps in understanding remain. Only nine US states require hospitals to collect data on infants exposed to drugs, such as opioids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65678b8d9ab23bd29a0f4ec6babfc6ee0aef9c4f/0_81_619_371/master/619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9311c07454d5a7a0af04179e413060e","title":"ricanstruction puerto ricos artists storm maria","story":"Hurricane Maria and its aftermath inspired musicians, visual artists and comedians to produce work and help relief effortsHurricane Maria shattered normal life in Puerto Rico, but the island’s thriving art community was ready to respond.Musicians, visual artists, comedians and artistic collectives orchestrated fundraisers, relief brigades and grant programs to assist people affected by the hurricane – while sharing stories and creating works inspired by the storm.A look at some of the artists responding to the hurricane:Comic creator Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez was at New York Comic Con promoting his Puerto Rican superhero La Borinqueña a few weeks after Maria struck when his table suddenly became a home for people grappling with the hurricane’s destruction.“They were crying and talking about how they hadn’t heard from their families,” Miranda-Rodriguez told Entertainment Weekly. “I became emotional as well, since I hadn’t heard from my own family either. It became more than just an opportunity to promote my own book, it became a safe space.”This comedy troupe seized on Puerto Rico’s new normal and poked fun at things like the new hairstyles bred from the lack of consistent electricity and clean water including the “messy bun” and “dirty braid” in the After Maria show. Their existing characters from a Housewives spinoff were also brought to the post-hurricane world, including two wealthy women struggling with the shortage of luxuries after Maria.Lucienne Hernández, a member of the group, told WNYC the entire group was depressed after the hurricane. “So I think that we as performers used this, I think, as a therapy, and people also,” Hernández said. “And that’s the relationship that we have with our audience, trying to laugh about the situation, you know, that’s part of our culture, that’s just how we are.”Puerto Ricans Raquel Berríos and her partner, Luis Alfredo Del Valle, were movers and shakers on the New York City music scene when Maria hit. The overwhelming scale of destruction drew them back home two months later. “For about a month and a half we were in a daze,” Berríos told Flaunt. “You were here surviving and we were over there thinking, ‘what can we do?’”On the island, they started the Prima fund with musician Ani Cordero, who grew up between San Juan and Atlanta. The fund gives $500 grants to help artists who like so many others faced hardship from losing their jobs – or were challenged by things specific to their industry: like having their equipment damaged in the storm or losing money from cancelled shows.San Juan art space Beta-Local was one of several artistic groups to use its network to channel relief efforts such as food distributions and workshops for children while schools were closed. Director Michael Linares told Frieze in April: “If the space needed to become a provisional hospital, so be it.” Because the group has ties to arts groups in the US, it received donations from the Warhol Foundation, the Rauschenberg Foundation, the Hiic Federation and Lin Manuel-Miranda, that were then funneled to nearly 100 artists across Puerto Rico.The singer-songwriter Luis Fonsi was responsible for 2017’s song of the summer, Despacito, and was Puerto Rico’s official spokesman for tourism when the hurricane hit. In the wake of Maria, he became a worldwide ambassador for the island, where devastation included the site of his viral Despacito video, the San Juan barrio La Perla.In March, Fonsi welcomed people back to the island in a set of fresh tourism videos and in June, his world tour stopped in Puerto Rico for two nights. He told the crowd: “There is nothing like returning home. I have been counting the days for the last few months for tonight to get here and step on that Puerto Rican soil and receive that warmth that is only felt in this beautiful land.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff85178607505bc1664009d967dd48dcae74075/397_693_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c713fcd3ea2d1f052d5a2901c8d340","title":"buddhist monks in the himalayas get ready for winter in pictures","story":"About 5,500m (18,000ft) above sea level in the Indian Himalayas sits the Tangyud Gompa Buddhist monastery, where snow can leave the monks in complete isolation for seven months a year.

Between 2015 and 2016, average daily consumption per metered household fell by 8.4 per cent. Nationally, homes used an average of 383 litres per day in 2015. This fell to 351 litres in 2016. In Dublin, usage rates fell from 373 litres to 351 litres on average over the same period. The average among the highest users was 1,310 daily litres but this had dropped from 1,665 litres in 2015. Gerry Brady, senior statistician in the Environment and Climate Division of the CSO said this significant overall decrease is most likely the product of ongoing repairs to domestic water pipes. These have been carried out by Irish Water since 2015 and target pipes running from the external mains supply to household taps. Internal repairs, carried out by homeowners, have also helped reduce consumption. “We know there was a well-promoted First Fix Free scheme and average consumption has decreased among the largest users,” Mr Brady said. “The reduction has been in the big, big users. All that to me says it has to be from the leak repairs on the customer side, not in the mains.”This “First Fix Free” programme has been targeting leaks identified by water metres looking for constant or comparatively high levels of use, an indicator that water is leaving the system before it reaches the end user. The number of metres installed around the country rose from 497,238 in 2014 to 691,453 in 2016. Their rollout has been a source of grievance among those opposed to the related introduction of metered water charges and has since been scaled back. Those familiar with the technology say it appears to be working when it comes to plugging holes in supply. The CSO data shows that in 2016, 37 per cent of total water use was accounted for by just 10 per cent of households. About 75 per cent of total consumption was accounted for by 99.1 per cent of users. However, just 0.9 per cent of households used the other 25 per cent. That latter, disproportionately high figure is most likely explained by remaining customer-side leaks in the system by the end of 2016, sources have said. The issue of supply has been highlighted in the recent spell of prolonged dry weather, leading to significant water use restrictions around the country including hosepipe bans. Irish Water estimates that almost half of all water produced for consumption is lost on the supply side. However, identifying the source of leaks has proven historically difficult as most are underground. The arrival of water metering technology has allowed it to more accurately pinpoint problematic areas.In Dublin in 2016, the lowest average daily consumption was in the areas of Chapelizod and Palmerstown. This had dropped since 2015 from an average of 290 litres to 274. The highest level of use in the capital in 2016 was in the areas of Firhouse, Jobstown and Tallaght, at 569 litres. Outside the capital, Co Cavan had the lowest overall average consumption level at 298 litres (down from 313 in 2015 when it was again the lowest consumer outside Dublin). In 2016, Co Offaly had the highest average use at 398 litres. It replaced counties Kerry and Tipperary which had the highest consumption levels in 2015 at an average of 430 litres. Between the two sets of figures, Co Offaly consumption fell from 413 litres while Kerry and Tipperary fell to 355 and 363 respectively.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3591324.1533845232!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse paid private investigators 117 000 to monitor consultants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe investigators were hired to monitor inidual doctors’ hours.

The figures were obtained by the Medical Independent following a Freedom of Information request to the Department of Health. The department said the decision to hire private investigators to monitor the amount of time consultants spent working in the public and private sector was made by the HSE and its solicitors.They were hired to gather evidence for a High Court case between consultants and the HSE, over an alleged breach of the consultants contract in terms of salary increases during the financial crisis. The consultants took legal action after a decision by the then minister for health, Mary Harney, in April 2009 not to pay the final phase of increases provided for under the terms of the 2008 medical consultants’ contract.The case was settled by the State in June. The settlement comprised €182 million in back pay, and ongoing costs of €62 million a year from next January, with arrears to be paid from June onwards. The HSE confirmed the amount paid for private investigators in the case, but a spokeswoman said the health service would not be providing a breakdown on the spending, or say how long the investigators were used for.The private investigators were hired to monitor inidual doctors’ hours, amid concern that some consultants were not fulfilling their contracted hours in the public system and were instead treating private patients."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"New report says compost could contain bacteria known to cause pneumonia\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquove done this for 23 years.

Photograph:  Sebastien CourdjiPool via ReutersThe British government asked Ireland to ease off on its emphasis on peace in Northern Ireland as one of the main issues at stakes in the Brexit talks.The request, from representatives of the UK administration, was made in recent months because British prime minister Theresa May was said to be hurt and concerned her credentials as a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement were not being taken seriously, sources disclosed. However, Dublin did not accede to the call because of a view that the peace process should remain central to the Brexit negotiations.The revelation comes as Mrs May steps up preparations for the UK leaving the bloc without a deal. She is reported to have instructed her officials to make contingencies in such a scenario to ensure the Border is free of customs checks and police.It is understood the request came in meetings between figures from the Irish and UK governments as Mrs May was preparing to secure the backing of her Cabinet for her vision of a future relationship with the European Union after Brexit.The UK government published its white paper on its preferred future relationship last month, which set out a common customs area between the EU and UK, as well as Britain remaining aligned to the European single market for goods.However, its key measures have been met with opposition from the EU. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has also said that the integrity of the EU single market – and the accompanying commitment to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital – must be respected. On the message from the British government on the emphasis on peace and the Irish border, a source said: “Successive Irish and British governments have protected a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland and we need to make sure that continues, regardless of Brexit.” This includes a need for no hard Border.Another Dublin figure said the UK government felt that the peace process and Irish Border were being seen as mostly of concern to “nationalists, Dublin and the EU”, but were equally a concern of unionists and Mrs May’s minority Conservative administration, which has a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In a letter to members of the Conservative Party in recent days, Mrs May said she “remained clear that no deal is better than a bad deal – and we are stepping up our ‘no deal’ preparations”. Among her commitments, Mrs May said: “There will be no hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We will remain one United Kingdom with a single internal market.” She said the two options on offer from the EU – a “standard” free trade agreement “with Northern Ireland staying in the customs union and parts of the single market” or UK membership of the customs union and single market – are “unacceptable”. The wording of the so-called “backstop” arrangement – which would guarantee no hard border even in a no deal Brexit scenario – is one the main sticking points in EU-UK talks, which Mrs May said have reached an “impasse”. The EU has said that without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement – threatening a “no-deal” Brexit where the UK crashes out of the EU next March.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tim O’BrienA family who bought a former Garda station within the Dublin commuter belt for €6,000 from the Office of Public Works has said it may rent out the building as holiday accommodation.The former Garda station at Crossakiel, Co Meath, which was sold in June 2015, was just one of 42 former Garda stations sold between 2014 and 2016. Their sale netted the State €3.228 million.The former station at Crossakiel is a small pitched-roof building with just three rooms including kitchen and toilet facilities. It appears well maintained and in good condition. It is located on a hill looking towards the Loughcrew Cairns, a tourism attraction.According to Peter McCann of local auctioneers Martin Shortt, the former station is firmly within the Dublin commuter belt, being “five minutes” or about the same number of kilometres from the northern end of the M3 motorway to Dublin.Mr McCann is seeking €185,000 to €190,000 for a house in a development called The Cairns, across the road from the former Garda station. At €6,000 the price paid is comparable to three months rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin 2.Jim Murphy, who bought the building, told The  his family may use it for holiday accommodation, perhaps for people attending weddings at the Crover House Hotel on Lough Sheelin. The building is currently used by Mr Murphy and his family as storage.It is understood the OPW initially asked Mr Murphy for €10,000 for the building in early 2015. But, despite the attractive price, the family did not jump at the deal. Mr Murphy said the electricity cables for the premises came across from his own house and the two properties shared the same sewage facilities. “There was lots of clauses in the sale – they really couldn’t sell it to anyone else,” he said.The €6,000 sales price figure, along with the figures for the other 41 stations sold between 2014 and 2016, was given to Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe, in reply to a written parliamentary question in July. Mr O’Callaghan criticised the sales, saying they had generated “small money” and “deprived the public of strategically important buildings”.Among the stations on the list was Ballacolla Station in Co Laois which was sold in September 2016 for €15,000 Ballinahown in Co Westmeath which made €20,00 in January 2016 and Rathowen station in Co Westmeath – some 98km from Dublin city – which sold for €15,000 in June 2015.The former station at Baldwinstown in Co Wexford, a five-bay, two-storey building listed on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, was sold for €75,000 in March 2014.At the upper end of the scale was Lauragh Garda station, near Glanmore Lake and Derreen Gardens, on the edge of Kenmare Bay in Co Kerry, which made €115,000 in February 2016. The building, which sits well back from the road, was refurbished by the OPW in 2007 at a cost of €57,370 which included a tarmacadam drive.In 2008 Lauragh Garda station was refurbished again at a cost of €58,617 and works included reslating of the roof of an outhouse, fitting of doors, tiling, bathroom works and installation of intruder and of fire detection alarms. In 2010 the OPW spent €9,988, which was described as “works to galvanised gates”. In all the refurbishment cost more then €125,000 before the station was sold for €115,000.It is understood the OPW was obliged under the terms on which it acquired the property, to offer the premises to the Derreen Estate. Jamie Bigham, whose family owns the estate, said it was “a matter of public record that the estate had to get it back”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3591393.1533845865!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"low water and poor visibility blamed for cruisers grounding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screen grab image from the crew camera of the volunteer crew members removing a boat from Slate Rock in June. Shannon boaters have been warned to be careful of reduced water levels and adverse weather conditions after an unusually high number of rescues this summer – including a total of 10 people who were taken from Lough Ree at the weekend.On Saturday, Lough Ree RNLI was called out to assist five people on board two private vessels which had run aground east of Inchenagh Island at the northern end of the lough.Conditions on the lake at the time were very blustery with a force four wind, very heavy rain showers and choppy waters. When the lifeboat crew arrived on scene, a boat was still aground, while the second vessel, a barge with one person on board, had freed itself and did not require assistance.The boat had two adults and two children on board and, having determined all on board were okay and the boat was not taking on water, the lifeboat crew towed the vessel into safe water where it was able to continue under its own power to Portrunny.Later that day, the Lifeboat crew were called to assist three people on board a boat that had run aground in Bantry Bay on the northeastern shore.On Sunday afternoon the Lifeboat was called out again, this time to two people on board a vessel that went aground near Inch Cleraun on the Western side of the lake. The boat was towed into Portrunny harbour.Waterways Ireland recently warned boaters of low water levels in areas south of Jamestown, Co Leitrim and north of Tarmonbarry, Co Longford.On Thursday of this week, inland waterways enthusiasts reported on social media that water levels were just two feet deep in parts of the navigation channel in an area of the lake known as Hexagon Shoal.Michael McDonnell, who operates a Viking Tour boat based in Athlone, said boats grounding on submerged or partly submerged rocks on the lake was now becoming an almost daily sight and, should the dry spell continue, conditions were likely to get worse.While he said water levels in Lough Ree were in fact holding up “surprisingly well”, compared to elsewhere, he added “there is only so much water to come down the river”. “The low levels will spread,” he said.Lough Ree Lifeboat Station press officer Sarah Bradbury said much of the rainfall in recent days would be soaked up by the ground and it would require higher levels of consistent rain to have a significant effect on water levels.She said many of the groundings in recent days may have been caused by boaters losing visibility in sudden downpours and mistaking their location. Ms Bradbury said the advice for boaters was to pay careful attention to maps and charts and to slow down in downpours, but not to the extent where the boat could be blown off course. She said many hand held mobile phones could now also be used to ascertain the position of boats in real time .“We would like to remind everyone to respect the water, when out on the water always wear your life-jacket and carry a means of communication, either a mobile phone or a VHF radio, so you can request assistance if needed.”Damien Delaney of the Lough Ree Lifeboat Station said the lifeboat was called out four times in three days earlier this month to help a total of 15 people, including children on boats in the lake. The station later issued a warning to boat users to be aware that water levels may be lower than usual and to keep to the centre of navigation where possible.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"opw cannot explain conflicting figures for garda station sales","story":"The OPW has said it cannot explain why the sale prices given by a senior government Minister for some former Garda stations differ from the sale prices recorded on the State’s Property Price Register.In a number of cases sale price figures provided by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe, to Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan in the Dáil, differed from the prices recorded on the register. The register is maintained by the statutory Property Services Regulatory Authority and records the sale price as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of stamp duty. In addition to the discrepancies, many of the Garda station sales listed on Mr Donohoe’s list of 43 properties have yet to appear on the Property Price Register. In one example, Lauragh Garda station in Co Kerry was, according to information provided by Mr Donohoe, sold on February 16th, 2016, for €115,000. Yet the figure recorded on the Property Price Register was €50,000. Jamie Bingham whose family own the Derreen Estate near Kenmare which bought the property, said he could not explain the discrepancy. “I have no idea why that might be,” he said. In another case, Cloone Garda station in Co Leitrim was said by Mr Donohoe to have achieved a sale price of €50,000, but the reported price on the Property Price Register was €40,000. Mr O’Callaghan, who tabled the Dáil question on the sale of Garda stations, said he too could not explain the discrepancy in the State’s figures. He will ask a further question in the Dáil about it, he said. The OPW said the Residential Property Price Register “holds the date of sale, price and address of residential properties purchased since January 2010, as declared by the purchaser to the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of stamp duty”. It added: “The data is provided by persons conveyancing a property on behalf of the purchaser. Therefore, the data entered on the register in this case is not a matter for the OPW.” A spokesman for the Revenue Commissioners said it could not comment on inidual tax cases. The Property Price Register is maintained by the Property Services Regulatory Authority. In a statement last night, a spokeswoman for the authority said the register contains two entries under the address of Lauragh Garda Station, one dated February 2016 with a sale price of €50,000 and a second entry dated February 2017 also with a sale price of €50,000. “This Register is compiled from data which is filed, for stamp duty purposes, with the Revenue Commissioners,” she said.“The data is primarily filed electronically by persons doing the conveyancing of the property on behalf of the purchaser. The PSRA does not in any way edit the data. It simply publishes, in a fully transparent manner, the data from the declarations which are filed with the Revenue Commissioners. Barry Ward, a barrister, however suggested last night the discrepancy in the figures may be connected with the fact the residential property price register is focussed specifically on residential properties and many of the rural Garda stations sold may have included both residential and commercial elements. The commercial elements wouldn’t have been captured on the register. Since 2014, including Garda stations, the OPW disposed of 32 properties by public auction, 42 properties were sold by private treaty and three properties were transferred to other State bodies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584276.1533214652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"united ireland the south of ireland doesn t want us and can t afford us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties. Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578359.1532700124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the history of the kettle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat, which is just another form of energy the heat then boils the water. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien During the recent heat wave I realised just how assimilated to Ireland I have become. No, it wasn’t because I complained that the temperature was too high just three days in. It was because I kept making cups of tea, hot cups of tea. Somehow in 17 years a beverage I just about tolerated in cold weather became suitable refreshment for any weather. This got me thinking about the technology that I use to make my tea. I imagine that almost every household in Ireland owns an electric kettle. They are, to my continued surprise, not very popular in the United States. One of the earliest uses of electricity to power a small household appliance, the kettle hasn’t changed very much in over 50 years.An electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat (just another form of energy), the heat then boils the water. Heat is generated by passing an electrical current through a material that provides resistance. The bottom of the kettle is generally where heat is created, replacing the fire over which it might have been boiled. The use of electricity to produce “clean” heat in the home expanded in the 1880s with a particular focus on cooking technologies such as electric stoves. However, it was not until the 20th century that the availability of household wiring and the lower price of electricity made home electrical appliances more attractive. Small appliances were connected at a lamp socket, in place of the lamps that represented the first use of electricity in homes.Early electric kettles look exactly like standard kettles except with a flex attached. They were not as efficient as current kettles, taking perhaps 20 minutes to boil. One model, the Prometheus kettle from the turn of the century, can still be found as an antique. In 1929, the ESB advertised a copper “electric automatic safety kettle” that looked much like the Prometheus of 30 years before. They enticed customers with the promise that the kettle “will not get black” and was “absolutely clean because electricity heats without flame”.The automatic safety element the ESB advertised was one of the first modifications of the design. Prior to its introduction, it was possible to boil the kettle dry causing the kettle to fail and risking an electrical fire. Yet the safety device created its own problems. A person whose kettle had stopped working was tempted to investigate the cause of the failure themselves. Death by electrocution often followed. A series of articles in the British Medical Journal as late as the 1960s suggested that women over 60 were particularly vulnerable to electrocution “due to the use of scissors in the investigation of the connectors of electric irons and kettles”. One doctor even described the electric kettle with its safety device as “a booby trap for old ladies”.Unbeknown to the old ladies and indeed their old doctors, a modified safety switch was already available. The new switch, one that we tea drinkers are familiar with from its happy click, was operated by steam and turned off the kettle once it had boiled. The kettle did not boil dry nor did it short circuit and those thirsty for tea were not tempted to poke at wiring with the nearest available pointed object. By the 1960s the electric tea kettle was a standard, and safe, home appliance.If you are intrigued by the history of household technologies then I recommend a visit to Johnstown Castle in Co Wexford. The gardens are beautiful for a walk and you can even feed the peacocks. But if you fancy a break from the heat, or you’re lucky enough to get a rainy day, the museum is well worth a visit. Billed as an agricultural museum, this is in many ways really a museum of the history of technology. There is plenty of technology relating to farming from early tractors to milking machines to pesticide spreaders. On the very top floor, almost at the end of the exhibition is an exploration of household technologies. You can compare model kitchens pre and post electrification and read about a variety of different home electrical devices and their introduction. And then you can go downstairs to refresh yourself with a cup of tea and an excellent scone.

The game records the player\u0027s sense of direction and navigational ability.Due to its popularity, the game has turned into the world\u0027s biggest dementia research experiment.“We’ve found that the environment you live in has an impact on your spatial navigation abilities,” said the study’s lead author, Professor Hugo Spiers.“We’re continuing to analyse the data and hope to gain a better understanding of why people in some countries perform better than others.”For the current study, researchers restricted the data to those who had provided their age, gender and nationality, and were from countries with at least 500 participants.As part of their analysis, the research team corrected for video game ability by comparing participants’ main results to their performance in tutorial levels, which assessed peoples\u0027 natural ability with video games.The researchers suggested people performed better in wealthier countries as well because they had better education standards, health and an ability to travel. TA country\u0026#39s GDP had a significant effect on peoples\u0026#39 navigation skillsHowever, countries with an national interest in orienteering or sport relying on navigations, such as the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia, also played a factor, they suggested.“Our findings suggest that sex differences in cognitive abilities are not fixed, but instead are influenced by cultural environments, such as the role of women in society,” said study co-author Dr Antoine Coutrot, who completed the research at UCL before moving to the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).Gender equality has previously been found to eliminate differences in maths performance in school. The current study is the first to connect gender inequality to a more specific cognitive measure.The study was conducted by researchers at UCL, the University of East Anglia, McGill University, Bournemouth University, ETH Zurich and Northumbria University.“The data from Sea Hero Quest is providing an unparalleled benchmark for how human navigation varies and changes across age, location and other factors. The ambition is to use these data insights to inform the development of more sensitive diagnostic tools for diseases like Alzheimer’s, where navigational abilities can be compromised early on,” said Tim Parry, Director at Alzheimer’s Research UK, which funded the analysis.Please review our commenting policyEngland gets newest mountain as Lake District hill reclassified Man charged with failing to keep his pig on a lead in NorwichNHS trusts relying on the same agency workers for years on end New MPs\u0026#39 expenses controversy as watchdog to stop publishing details of tax-payer funded homesV\u0026ampA museum launches lingerie line inspired by cushion covers Tory chairman accused of trying to \u0026#39kneecap\u0026#39 Boris Johnson as party investigates burka commentsEU leaders \u0026#39open to Brexit compromise\u0026#39, but Theresa May warned they may be setting a trapPuerto Rico says Hurricane Maria death toll may be 1,427 - despite official figure of 64Comment: Donald Trump is no one\u0026#39s fool as Russia is finding outTrump administration calls for \u0026#39Space Force\u0026#39 to be established by 2020Monks should be stripped of control following sex abuse cover up at two Benedictine schools, report findsMale, pale and stale university professors to be given \u0026#39reverse mentors\u0026#39Steer clear of potentially deadly stingrays off southern France, bathers warnedComment: What\u0026#39s the point of recycling if it just ends up propping up the Polish mafia?Not so Glorious Twelfth: Grouse shoots cancelled across Britain after stocks hit by extreme weather Muslim women on the burka Social media giants using \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 persuasion techniques to keep children hooked, psychologists warn Germany lifts ban on Nazi symbols in video gamesSex scandal at American \u0026#39megachurch\u0026#39 causes leaders to quit after ten women accuse founder We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/09/TELEMMGLPICT000171239111_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"fathers like harry kane turning birth competitive sport","story":"Harry Kane announced the birth of his second child, Vivienne Jane, on Twitter this weekThanks for the support, chaps, but childbirth isn’t a contest​ Pity the modern man.

We wrote to the provincial health secretary asking him to restrict these two drugs from the area.

Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmission, threatening the health of humans and wildlife.”Vultures\u0027 removal of carrion leaves less food for other scavengers, such as dogs. A collapse in vulture numbers in India has been blamed for a huge rise in the feral dog population at the same time and a rise in rabies cases. Vultures strong digestive juices also allow them to eat diseased carrion, cleaning up carcasses that may be infected with deadly microbes.Where will the next pandemic come from? | The candidatesThe most common NSAID, diclofenac, was banned from veterinary use in Pakistan, India and Nepal in 2006. But vets have continued to use residual stockpiles and the similar drugs aceclofenac and ketoprofen have continued to pose a threat to the Gyps group of vultures, including white-backed vultures and long-billed vultures. Tens of millions are thought to have died in the past two decades across South Asia alone, cutting populations by somewhere between 95 and 99 per cent.Mr Iqbal said conservationists will conduct spot checks at vets to see if the restrictions have really cut back on the availability of the drugs, or whether they are still available on the black market.He has been carrying out research on vultures for more than 20 years. He said: “The populations are still declining. If this decline continues, we are afraid that these species will become extinct.”To try to stem the birds\u0027 decline, the PVRP has set up a breeding centre in Punjab province and a “vulture safe zone” in Sindh where some of the last colonies of white-backed and long-billed vultures can be found.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security England gets newest mountain as Lake District hill reclassified Man charged with failing to keep his pig on a lead in NorwichNHS trusts relying on the same agency workers for years on end New MPs\u0026#39 expenses controversy as watchdog to stop publishing details of tax-payer funded homesDo men have a better sense of direction?

Anything were you are deliberately trying to get every penny out of a person can be seen as exploitative.”He said that teengers and children were particularly susceptible when it came to developing problems with overuse.“Children’s brains are still developing and when young people do things they find it more exciting,” added Dr Griffith.The signatories of the US letter said they published it “to call attention to the unethical practice of psychologists using hidden manipulation techniques to hook children on social media and video games”.Their main concern was that psychologists were helping to develop “persuasive design” techniques that exploit vulnerabilities in human psychology to keep people scrolling and playing.The longer people use social media, the more they can be advertised to. With video games, the more gamers play and become invested the more likely they are to spend money on microtransactions in those games.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreIt added that “such design capitalises on children’s developmental vulnerabilities” such as fear of rejection and need for social acceptance, to which children were particularly susceptible.The letter cited research that showed that girls who spend more time using social media or smartphones were at greater risk of depression.It also said that the same techniques in video games were contributing to boys playing for hours on end to the detriment of their academic and employment prospects.The signatories warned: “The great majority of parents have no idea that the social media and video games used by children are developed by psychologists and other experts who use advanced behavior change techniques to pull kids into these platforms and keep them there as long as possible.”The letter added: “The APA (American Psychological Association) has not yet addressed how psychologists and their behavior change tools are used by the tech industry to manipulate children for profit.”Duty of Care CampaignPlease review our commenting policyEngland gets newest mountain as Lake District hill reclassified Man charged with failing to keep his pig on a lead in NorwichNHS trusts relying on the same agency workers for years on end New MPs\u0026#39 expenses controversy as watchdog to stop publishing details of tax-payer funded homesDo men have a better sense of direction?

Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.”In recent years, studies have shown that even an increase of a few hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air we breath causes people to test lower for cognitive skills.

Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.Joseph AllenCarbon dioxide levels reached as high as 1,400 parts per million on five percent of airline flights the European Aviation Safety Agency tested, according to data it released last year. The average was 603 parts per million, just slightly higher than levels found in the air.Airliners replenish oxygen in a plane at high altitudes by pulling in the thin air and pressurising it, mostly by scooping it from the front end of jet engines.No passports, more turbulence and standing cabins – 18 ways flying is going to changeBecause earlier studies showed people performed more poorly on tests of brain function at levels as low as 1,000 parts per million, the researchers thought it would make sense to examine pilot skills and carbon dioxide.Thirty airline pilots were recruited to fly multiple three-hour segments in a special flight simulator in which carbon dioxide levels could be manipulated.Performance on 21 manoeuvres ranging from making a steep turn to handling an emergency engine fire, decreased as carbon dioxide levels rose, according to the study.Flight examiners certified by the Federal Aviation Administration rated the pilots’ performance.At 700 parts per million, pilots were 69 percent more likely to correctly perform the manoeuvres compared to when they were breathing carbon dioxide at 2500 parts per million.

One example was when a captain on a Colgan Air flight made a series of abrupt manoeuvres in 2009 near Buffalo, causing a perfectly good commuter plane to plunge to the ground, killing 50.At the very least, Allen said, regulation agencies like the FAA might want to study the issue and compare the growing research on the effects of carbon dioxide with the existing US regulations on aircraft design.England gets newest mountain as Lake District hill reclassified Man charged with failing to keep his pig on a lead in NorwichNHS trusts relying on the same agency workers for years on end New MPs\u0026#39 expenses controversy as watchdog to stop publishing details of tax-payer funded homesDo men have a better sense of direction?

Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/16/perseids.jpg","title":"perseids meteor shower when where explained how to see date time","story":"Created with Sketch.View should be visible across the worldClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Perseid meteor shower, one of the high points in the celestial calendar, occurs each year as the Earth ploughs through dusty debris left by Comet Swift-TuttleThe Perseid\u0026nbspmeteor shower is to pass over the UK and the rest of the world, lighting up the sky with a stunning celestial sight.And the display could be even brighter than ever, since a new moon will mean that the shooting stars have a clear stage for the world to see them.The Perseid meteor shower, one of the high points in the celestial calendar, occurs each year as the Earth ploughs through dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle.Perseids meteor shower around the worldHundreds of astronomy lovers enjoy the meteor shower in the aboriginal town of Atalayita in Canary IslandsA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridA shot of the Perseid meteor shower in 2008Shooting star illuminates the night sky near SieversdorfA streak appears in the sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower above a roadside silhouette of a Spanish fighting bull, conceived decades ago in Spain as highway billboards, in Villarejo de SalvanesA shooting star of the Perseids meteor shower burns up in the atmosphere in this photo taken near Salgotarjan, some 100km northeast of BudapestIn this photo taken with long shutter speed, a meteor sparks, lower right, while entering the earth\u0027s atmosphere behind an olive tree during the Perseids Meteor Shower, in Fanos villageStars and meteors are seen in a wide angle picture of the sky over MadridA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridHundreds of astronomy lovers enjoy the meteor shower in the aboriginal town of Atalayita in Canary IslandsA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridA shot of the Perseid meteor shower in 2008Shooting star illuminates the night sky near SieversdorfA streak appears in the sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower above a roadside silhouette of a Spanish fighting bull, conceived decades ago in Spain as highway billboards, in Villarejo de SalvanesA shooting star of the Perseids meteor shower burns up in the atmosphere in this photo taken near Salgotarjan, some 100km northeast of BudapestIn this photo taken with long shutter speed, a meteor sparks, lower right, while entering the earth\u0027s atmosphere behind an olive tree during the Perseids Meteor Shower, in Fanos villageStars and meteors are seen in a wide angle picture of the sky over MadridA multiple exposure picture shows a Perseids meteor shower in the sky, near the municipality of La Hiruela, on the mountains of the Sierra Norte de MadridAs the particles, ranging in size from a grain of sand to a pea, hit the Earth\u0027s atmosphere at 60km (37 miles) per second, they burn up and streak across the sky.Once darkness falls on August 12, sky-watchers can expect to see one of the shooting stars every few minutes.The Perseids reach their peak in the early hours of August 13 when up to 70 per hour should be visible.Dr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: The shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.Unlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.To make the best of the meteors, observers should avoid built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.The shooting stars will appear to come from a single point, or radiant, situated in the constellation Perseus, that climbs higher as the night progresses.Greater numbers of meteors are visible when the radiant is high. But the most spectacular long-lasting meteors, known as Earthgrazers, can be seen when the radiant is still low above the horizon.Lucky observers may see the occasional meteor sailing across the sky for several seconds, leaving behind a trail of glowing smoke.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg","title":"brexit new poll public final say no deal scenario","story":"Created with Sketch.Just one in four trust parliament with the decision as ‘no deal’ looms according to 10,000 strong poll sampleClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Half of Britons want final say in no-deal scenario, major new poll findsHalf of Britons want a referendum on leaving the European Union if Brexit talks collapse and the country faces leaving with no deal, a major new poll has revealed.The huge study carried out by YouGov, which surveyed a weighted sample of more than 10,000 people, found just a quarter want parliament to be given the final decision.The key finding comes as concern over a no-deal Brexit increases, precipitating a slump in sterling\u0026nbspamid news that the UK government is stockpiling food and medicine.The findings are\u0026nbspalso a major boost to the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum, which commissioned the poll, and The Independent’s own Final Say campaign – which has attracted more than half a million signatories to its petition.The survey also shines a light on views of Brexit’s progress, with large majorities thinking talks are going poorly, that the process of leaving has been a mess, that the country would end up with a bad deal and that the British government would bear responsibility.Former president of YouGov Peter Kellner said: “If the Brexit negotiations with Brussels break down, a two to one majority of voters want the public, not parliament, to decide what happens.“Even people who voted Leave tend to prefer a new referendum, by 39-34 per cent. This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly. Support for a new referendum would go well beyond the ranks of those who want to stop Brexit.”The pollsters asked “should the final decision be made by MPs voting in parliament or the public voting in a new referendum”, if the UK had to choose whether to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this messHalf, 50 per cent, said the decision should be given to the public voting in a new referendum. Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Populations of the invasive species have been discovered across the US eastern seaboard.An east-Asian species of tick capable of swarming animals and sucking their blood so fast they die has established itself in the US, with eight states on the eastern seaboard reporting the presence of the pest.Public health officials have said they are concerned about the growing presence of the Asian longhorned tick, (Haemaphysalis longicornis), which carries and transmits unpleasant diseases in its homeland.In the US none have yet been found with any human diseases. In Asia, however, the species carries a virus that has been known to have a fatality rate of up to\u0026nbsp30\u0026nbspper cent.Woman suffers facial paralysis after being bitten by tick in gardenViral photo of ticks on muffin terrifies the internetTravellers to the US face threat from mosquito-borne diseasesRetired woman ticks off bucket list goal after man asks her on dateThough the invasive species has already spread to the densely populated New York suburbs, at the moment the greatest threat remains to livestock pets, and wild animals.The ticks can attack en masse and drain animals of blood so quickly they die – a cause of death known as exsanguination.Initially\u0026nbsphard to see with the naked eye, following a blood meal\u0026nbspthe ticks swell up to about the size of a baked bean, and females can then lay hundreds of eggs.Populations of the ticks can explode rapidly as the species is able to reproduce asexually – giving rise to an army of ravenous clones.“One tick can crank out females in fairly large numbers,” Thomas Yuill, a retired pathobiologist at the University of Wisconsin, told the New York Times.Tadhgh Rainey, an entomologist at the public health department of Hunterdon County\u0026nbspin New Jersey, was first to report the discovery of large numbers of the tick, in a paper published in May this year.“All life stages were found on the sheep, which had no history of travel outside the country,” he said.\u0026nbspIn a subsequent interview he said the owner came to his department with ticks on her hands and wrists.\u0026nbsp“I thought she’d have a few,” Mr\u0026nbspRainey said. “But she was covered in them, easily over 1,000 on her pants alone.”New Jersey wildlife officials are calling for anyone who spots the bloodsucking arachnid to contact them immediately.“This tick is a known pest in deer and has a wide host range, thus can infect a range of wildlife species,” said department officials, who described the pest as “exotic”.The diseases the ticks have been known to spread include Rickettsia japonica, the bacteria which causes oriental spotted fever, and Theileria orientalis, a parasite that causes cattle theileriosis – in which cattle suffer fever and sometimes breathing difficulties and weight loss.Studies have also indicated that some populations of the tick in China may harbour a virus that causes SFTS – severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.The disease, first identified in 2009, causes fever, vomiting, hemorrhaging, and organ failure, and initially had a fatality rate of 30 per cent, though that has fallen significantly since its identification.World news in picturesA Palestinian girl smiles as she waits to receive aids at a United Nations food distribution centre in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern GazaAn Israeli soldier rides an armoured vehicle during an army drill after the visit of Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, IsraelUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic nominee in New York’s 14th Congressional District.Ms Davids, a lawyer who spent a year as a White House fellow as\u0026nbspBarack Obama handed off to Donald Trump, campaigned on a conventional Democratic platform, including expanded health care access, gun control and opposition to the current president\u0027s\u0026nbsptax breaks.A member of Ho-Chunk Nation, a Native American tribe in Wisconsin, Ms Davids was backed by Emily’s List, a national organisation dedicated to electing Democratic women.In a statement she called Mr Yoder “a pawn for Donald Trump.”“Now, we turn to the general election and set our sights on defeating Kevin Yoder, an extremist who has tried time and time again to undermine health care access and give tax breaks for the largest corporations,” Ms Davids said in the statement, The Kansas City Star\u0026nbspreported.\u0026nbspA spokesman for Mr Yoder, who has been endorsed by Mr Trump and has a significant financial advantage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Democrats believe they have a chance to pick up the seat, which represents the Kansas City area and its environs, as part of its larger quest to regain control of the House in the November general election. In a statement, Ben Ray Luján, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, called Ms Davids “a strong voice for working families” who is “ready to bring that fight to Congress.”“After this hard-fought primary win, Sharice emerges even stronger in her historic bid to flip this competitive seat,” he said.Trump-endorsed Kris Kobach in governor\u0027s race that came down to wireRepublicans survive scare to hold Kansas in special electionFirst Muslim woman to be elected to Congress in US historyHistory made as Democrats choose black woman for governor\u0027s race In a recent interview with The New York Times, Ms Davids said her background would be an asset in the House.“Having LGBT people sitting in the room while decisions are being made, and sitting there as peers, will shift the conversation,” she said. “I think it’s important that the lived experiences and the point of view of LGBT folks be included in conversations that affect all of us.”While Ms Davids would be the first congresswoman to have been an MMA fighter, she would not be the first member of Congress with octagon experience.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

We must have American dominance in space.The Pentagon and US Department of Defence have been tasked with creating the new force to ensure what Trump called American dominance of space.It will be the sixth branch of the US armed forces — alongside the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.Trump said he wants to counter Russian and Chinese developments in space tech.And he said he wants US agencies to implement a state-of-the-art framework for space traffic management.Announcing the decision on June, 18 2018, Trump said: We are going to have the Air Force, but we are going to have the Space Force — separate but equal.The United States already has some space fighting infrastructure and much of its military set-up has input from space technology — from long-range missiles to satellite tracking.The Colorado-based Air Force Space Command in 1982 includes more than 36,000 personnel around the world that provide space and cyber capabilities for the Defense Department.The Space and Missile Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base in California, designs, buys and oversees most of the Pentagons space systems.Trump said in the East Room of the White House: My administration is reclaiming Americas heritage as the worlds greatest spacefaring nation.The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers.“Im hereby directing the Department of Defence and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.”At the time, Mr Trump said Space Force would be separate but equal to the Air Force.Mr Trump backed his Vice President after he had finished speaking with a message on Twitter that read: Space Force all the way!  Previously, Mr Mattis had disapproved of creating a sixth branch of the military.Mattis wrote in a letter to the House and Senate armed services committees: “I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organisational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint war-fighting efforts.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425758573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dambusters bounding bomb kent beach","story":"James Crouch, 36, was set to fish for crabs with four-year-old Freddie, when he noticed the test bomb in Reculver, near Minnis Bay.The prototype barrel-shaped Vickers type 464 bomb - codenamed Upkeep - is believed to have been dropped by RAF crews ahead of the 1943 bombing mission Operation Chastise.RAF serviceman Guy Gibson and his crews released the bombs in a bid to target the heart of Nazi Germany.Before they completed the immense task of blasting Adolf Hitlers dams in the Ruhr Valley, they conducted a series of test-runs across Britain, before May 16-17.While they honed their skills, Guy Gibson and his 617 crews dropped four-tonne bombs filled with concrete were dropped in the likes of Wales, the Lake District and Kent.James said: It was mechanical and had obviously been there a long time because there were barnacles on it. We looked at it and thought it could be a bomb.Its amazing. It is great to find such a piece of history when you are out looking for crabs. Its exciting.Eight aircrafts were lost and 54 Commonwealth airmen were killed.Guy Gibson led 19 RAF Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron into the heart of Nazi Germany on the night of May 16-17 1943.They dropped bombs on three dams in the Ruhr Valley, in a bid to cause havoc in Hitlers industrial centre.The team blasted the dams, leaving water to swarm the surrounding ocuntryside, and much of Hitlers armement factories.Guy, the brave Wing Commander, made the first attack on Mohne Dam, but his bomb exploded short. Two aircrafts were shot down, but the RAF serviceman continued to attack as German soldiers fired.He was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.The Eder Dam was the next target, before the Sorpe Dam.The skilful nature of the mission was the inspiration for the 1955 film, The Dam Busters.They were dropped in top-secret test runs across Britain, including Wales, the Lake District and Kent.Only 11 of the 19 bombers that flew off to attack the Möhne, Edersee and Sorpe dams returned back to base.Dambusters expert Dr Hugh Hunt, a Reader in Engineering Dynamics \u0026amp Vibration at the University of Cambridge hailed the discovery as a piece of good British war history.Dr Hunt said: They did lots of testing around the county with these bombs filled with concrete because they could not use explosives.What has happened [to this bomb] is the steel has rusted away and you are left with the concrete.Some would have been recovered immediately after the tests they did as they did not want anybody to find out about the mission.In the years after the war it would have been hushed up. They did not do testing in places for very long because they did not want to spoil the surprise. They tested at night.This is quite an important find. I hope it goes somewhere useful.A similar prototype Dambusters bomb sits outside the Petwood Hotel in Lincolnshire, which was once home to the of the legendary RAF 617 “Dambusters” Squadron.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: HM Coastguard is currently investigating reports of ordnance found at Reculver, Herne Bay.At the moment the ordnance is covered by water but a Coastguard Rescue Team will be sent to investigate at the next low water, which is currently expected to be around 5pm today."},{"url":null,"title":"egypt ancient sphinx discovery valley of the kings","story":"The roadworks between the ancient temples of Karnak and Luxor have been halted after a large statue was discovered featuring a “lion’s body and a human head”.The relic could date as far back as 2500 BC and the reign of Pharoah Kafre.The Director General of Antiquities Mohamed Abel Aziz said the statue was still in the ground and was embedded in the soil but there are plans to excavate it but this could take some time.However the excavation could take some time due to the age of the statue and the chances of damaging it after thousands of years.A sphinx is a mythical creature usually depicted in Egypt as having a human head with the body of a lion.Egyptian sphinxes are usually depicted as male but Greek ones are often female.The Egyptian ones are seen as benevolent, but possessing incredible strength, and seen as s and can often be seen outside the entrance to temples.Many believe the head of the sphinx at Giza to be a the pharaoh Khafra.The oldest known sphinx though was found near Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and is believed to date to 9,500 BC.In Greek mythology, the sphinx was said to ask all passersby the riddle: Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?The sphinx then is meant to have devoured anyone who could not answer.Oedipus, according to legend, finally solved the riddle by replying: Man—who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age Khaled al Anani, the national heritage chief, encouraged people to go and visit the site to see the new discovery.Mr Abel Aziz confirmed the new find had similarities to the “classical” Great Sphinx of Giza which stands 66ft tall in front of the Great Pyramids."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425698298.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"saudi supercars london streets","story":"Every year the fabulously rich pay thousands just to bring in their four-wheeled toys as they take a holiday in the capital.Taking to the posh parts of Londons streets are high performance cars like Bugattis, McLarens and top end Mercedes as well as Rollers.As expected, flash cars from the likes of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as well as Kuwait have already been spotted.The season though is a godsend to traffic wardens with many flash cars simply parked up on double yellows outside some of Londons poshest shops.Although if youve paid a few thousand to transport your motor over from the Middle East, a mere parking ticket is probably their equivalent of spare change."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000301759643.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"womens refuges sun on sunday save our shelter campaign","story":"Ministers confirmed refuges can continue to claim housing benefit, which makes up half of their cash.Four in ten shelters faced closure amid plans to devolve funding to local authorities — taking them out of the welfare system.But the Ministry of Housing announced benefits will remain in place for all support housing.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire praised our sister paper’s three-year Save Our Shelters campaign.He said: “I commend The Sun on Sunday for its support of victims of domestic violence.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was protecting myself.“I would say, I took the decision of what I did very quickly.“As soon as this episode started I knew that myself or other people could be a target of these men.One had already told me what he would do. I felt under threat by these two.“He had ran at a close friend of mine with a bottle.As soon as I decided to get involved I felt that I was under threat and what I did was in defence of myself.”Stokes, nursing a bad back, switched between sitting and standing to give evidence.He told of his lager and vodka intake that night as he and England teammates celebrated a one-day win over the West Indies last September.Stokes was then asked what led to the fight, which left Mr Hale and Ali knocked unconscious and needing hospital treatment for facial injuries.The cricketer said he noticed Ali and Mr Hale and friends Mr O’Connor and Mr Barry shouting at each other in the street.Stokes told the jury: “Mr Hale and Mr Ali were shouting homophobic comments towards these two. I said you shouldn’t be taking the p*** because they are gay.“I was told by Mr Ali, along the lines of, ‘Shut the f*** up or I’ll bottle you,.”The court also heard from student Max Wilson who had filmed the incident on his phone from his digs overlooking pubs and clubs in the city’s Clifton Triangle.He said he passed the video to The Sun who in turn gave it to police.Mr Cole told Stokes: “We’re going to ask you about the Sun footage. Were you enraged?”Stokes replied: “I find it a difficult question to answer.”In bodycam footage following his arrest, Stokes was seen mouthing something to teammate Hales, 29.Asked what he was saying, Stokes told the court: “I was telling Hales, ‘Leave, get out of here, don’t get involved’.“I’m the one sat in a police car with cuffs on. It’s on me.”In his evidence Stokes denied earlier being homophobic to Mr O’Connor and Mr Barry outside Mbargo but claimed they were bantering about his bad dress sense.He said they were making comments about his clothes — including a pair of £695 white Buscemi hi-top trainers — shortly before the fight broke out.The star was again watched by wife Clare, 28 — mum to their two children — who has been sitting in the public gallery throughout the trial.He was previously accused by the nightclub bouncer of homophobia by mimicking the gay pair and flicking a cigarette butt at one.Asked by his barrister, Gordon Cole QC: “Were you mimicking them?”, the 6ft 2in all rounder replied: “No”.Mr Cole asked: “Was any of it homophobic?”Stokes replied: “No, definitely not.The only comments between myself and the gay couple was what we were wearing.I get told that quite a lot by my teammates that I dress the worst in the team.”Mr Cole asked: “Did you get angry about what was said?”Stokes replied: “No.”Mr Cole added: “Enraged?”Stokes said: “No.”Mr Cole held Stokes’ white designer trainers, which have a gold padlock on the heel, in the air for the jury to see.That prompted Judge Peter Blair to say: “They are Italian white leather I believe.”Asked if he remembered flicking a cigarette at the gay men, Stokes replied: “I don’t remember flicking a cigarette towards anyone as described.“It looks like I have done something in the direction in one of these gentlemen.”Mr Cole asked: “Do you remember throwing anything?” Stokes replied: “No.”The cricketer said he could not remember the first person he contacted after his arrest.He told the court: “I was stuck in a bit of a problem as I wasn’t sure who to contact.Being a cricketer I have a manager who looks after my stuff.”Stokes and Ali deny affray. The case continues.But Stokes denied offering that much money or saying anything about his teeth.He added: “I said to him ‘Come on mate I’ve got s*** tattoos as well’.“I’m constantly getting told from teammates that I play with that I’ve got s*** tattoos.”He also denied giving the doorman a V-sign.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Inside was a rolled up scroll of paper – a real-life message in a bottle. It read: “Hugh Craggs, Yacht St George RTYC, Will any finder please enclose message bearing date, name of finder, of ship, destination, do a rebury and send a postcard to Hugh Craggs 50 Ruskin Ave Manor Park London E12.” It was dated Aug 1, 1924. Grant, 26, from Toronto, was keen to find out more about Hugh so, after the discovery in May, he asked for help on discussion website Reddit What emerged was an amazing tale of fantastic voyages, cannibals and pirate treasure, and how a teenager who set sail from London almost a century ago seeking adventure sure found it. In 1922, 18-year-old Hugh and his three brothers lived in East London with his mother Imogen, after the death of his father John, an inspector with Scotland Yard who was also a published poet. Hugh, an assistant in the hosiery business, longed to escape his dreary life.  He tried to join Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Antarctic expedition, but was not chosen. Then on a train one day he saw an advert for a steward on an expedition to be led by Dr Cyril Lockhart Cottle, and funded by Sir Jeremiah Colman of the famous mustard family. They were to set sail on a schooner called Malaya. Leaving the train at the next station he wired Dr Cottle and arranged to meet him, bubbling with so much enthusiasm he won over the adventurer, beating 2,000 other applicants. In a newspaper interview just before they embarked, Hugh said: “I’ve been longing to go on a trip of adventure for years. It’s come at last. “We are to be away for about three years. I expect to find all the things I’ve read about. Wild beasts, we’re looking for wild animals, savages, fights with natives, we’re ready for anything.” There is even a British Pathe News reel entitled ‘Dr Cottles’s Expedition To Cannibal Islands’ showing the 90-tonne Malaya before the voyage moored in a London dock. The prime purpose was to look for new species of porpoises and dolphins. Sadly they would do this “by harpooning them”. Dr Cottle said: “We shall probably go to Vigo then to the Canaries, to the West Indies, on to Colon through the Panama Canal from there to scattered South Sea islands. We may call at Samoa, North New Guinea, Singapore and North Sumatra. Parts of North Sumatra are totally uncivilised, peopled by man-eating natives.” Within days of leaving Britain, the Malaya ran into “mountainous seas for 12 hours” before seeking shelter in the Canaries. A newspaper reported the only casualty was its chimpanzee mascot which “came to an untimely end, having strangled itself”.  In the Daily Mirror of June 15, 1922, the chief officer Dr Sinclair of Glasgow had explained before embarkation: “It is a docile, clever and intelligent animal which sits at table and passes the salt or pepper as required.” The trip to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador, where he left that message was to last more than three years. It seems travelling became a bit of a drug for young Hugh who did not return to Britain. Instead he disembarked in Colon, Panama, in February 1926.  He then moved to Cristobal, Panama, in 1929 where he became a banker and married an American called Gay, with whom he went on to have a daughter. But his adventurous spirit endured and Hugh had a dream of finding the  incredible Lima Treasure.  This is revealed in the 1935 book Rough and Tumble by Bob Roberts. In it another adventure-seeking sailor recounts: “In Cristobal we ran up against a young man named Hugh Craggs..[who]appeared vastly interested in our doings. “Craggs started talking of Cocos Island [around 350 miles off Costa Rica]. When serving in the Malaya he had spent 47 days there. The place fascinated him. “Stories of treasure said to have been buried there he had investigated and disproved so far as was humanly possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poverty stricken single mum goes","story":"NewsPoverty-stricken single mum goes SIX DAYS without food so her children can eat during summer holidaysSadie Drew, 30, struggles to feed her children outside of term time and without free school mealsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy ColesMike SmallcombeJohn Bett19:51, 9 AUG 2018Updated00:30, 10 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-four says she went SIX DAYS without food so her children could eat during the school holidays.

But when schools break up Sadie is left to find the extra food, and to make up the deficit she once went nearly a week without food. Now, Sadie is using her local CPR food banks to help feed the kids. Have you been struggling to feed your children after benefit cuts? Email webnews@mirror  She said: Kids don\u0027t stop eating, boredom kicks in and they replace that with food, and they just eat. Whereas in school they have certain snack times, and they are getting education, they are busy and their minds are ticking all the time. When that\u0027s not happening, they are just hungry all the time. It doesn\u0027t help when benefits cut you down from \u0026pound168 a week to \u0026pound116. It was tax credits, they decided they overpaid us two years ago, and they are taking it back at astronomical rates. Sadie says she feels no shame about using the food bank, because the welfare of her children is at stake.  My kids need to eat, and pride goes out the window when it involves children. If it was me, I\u0027d starve. I have done it for my children. Before I knew about the Foodbank and that I could get help, I was a single mum to my two girls and I didn\u0027t eat for six days straight. Without this place, it would be a major struggle. Don Gardner, who runs the CPR food banks at Camborne, Redruth and Pool, said children would go hungry this summer because their families relied on free school meals. On the first day of the holidays this year we gave out over 800 meals out in two hours, he said. That was a big afternoon we had. It made a very big dent in our stock. Two years ago we did 3,000 meals during the school holidays. We expect an increase in users because during term children are offered free school meals, and then suddenly mum\u0027s got two or three children at home and got to feed them for six weeks. And we\u0027re prepared for that.

Mark Murray bought a 99p multipack of Cheese Curls from Aldi in Lowestoft, Suffolk. The 26-year-old from the nearby market town of Beccles suspected one of the packets - supposedly containing about 14g of Cheese Curls was seriously underweight. The clip starts with Mark holding the yellow packet and commenting: “Got a packet of crisps from Aldi, a multipack, you can see there’s air in it, it’s not been opened.” Mark then opens the packet, which he upends, dropping a single curl on to the table. He then turns the opened packet to the camera to prove no other curls are lurking inside.  He comments: “One Crisp. Thanks Aldi.”  He uploaded the video on Facebook yesterday (Tues) after posting on Aldi’s facebook page.  He sarcastically captioned the footage, “Full up from my lunch now.” On social media, Jason Downing said: “This is the best thing ever.” Robert Daley commented: “And that’s why you don’t shop at Aldi! S*e!” Julia Murray said: “Hahahah I can’t stop laughing ‘cor, one crisp, thanks Aldi.’” "},{"url":null,"title":"brave psychiatric nurse left horrific","story":"NewsBrave nurse left with horrific burns after being attacked with boiling water by patientWARNING - GRAPHIC PHOTOS: Christie, whose skin was red and blistered, was visibly shaken and upset after the terrifying ordealShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByCatherine MurphyDanya BazaraaNews Reporter17:13, 9 AUG 2018Updated18:28, 9 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A brave psychiatric nurse was left with horrific burns after being attacked with boiling water by a patient.

The 25-year-old from the Wirral was shown being rushed to hospital where she was treated for her severe burns during last night\u0027s episode of 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE.   On arrival, Christie was shaking and visibly upset, the Liverpool Echo reports .  She was taken to St George\u0027s Hospital in South West London, where she was given painkillers and morphine to try and control the pain. Remarkably however, Christie admitted being attacked isn\u0027t something new and patients have attacked her in the past, before claiming to still enjoy her job despite these types of incidents.  Christie works as a mental health nurse at Princess Royal University Hospital in Kent, after being inspired by watching her grandparents working in the same profession. Describing the moment she was attacked, Christie said: We had to give her anti psychotic depot medication and we had to restrain and give it and then she had obviously come back and attacked afterwards. Christie\u0027s boyfriend Nathan, who received a call following the incident, admits he would prefer her to get a \u0027normal office job.  He said: She found a role in Kings College, London and she got accepted for it which was such a good moment. I didn\u0027t have too much exposure to mental health before Christie started working on the wards. I didn\u0027t know what she was getting herself into, it\u0027s really hard. I don\u0027t know why she wants to do it, I just couldn\u0027t do it myself. When she first started she found someone dead actually, which when you have just qualified it is a terrible experience.

Dad AP Pathak, his wife and their three-year-old son were flying from London to Berlin when they were removed from the plane. The family claim they were racially abused by a flight attendant and they were kicked off because the boy wouldn\u0027t stop sobbing. But it is claimed that the plane was forced to turn around for safety reasons because the parents failed to buckle their son into his seat despite numerous requests.  Mr Pathak, a bureaucrat with India\u0027s government, has written to that country\u0027s aviation minister alleging humiliation and racial behaviour.. He claimed to Indian media that it was an act of racial discrimination. Mr Pathak claims his son began crying as flight BA8495 was preparing to take off from London City Airport on July 23.  He told ANI that his wife took the boy into her arms, and a male flight attendant began shouting, scolded my son to go to his seat and used racist remarks.   The dad, who works for India\u0027s ministry of road transport and highways, claims his son was terrified and began sobbing again, and his wife put the youngster in his seat and fastened his seat belt. The crying continued as the plane taxied to the runway, the dad said. He claims the same flight attendant then returned and shouted you bloody keep quiet otherwise you will be thrown out of the window. The family claim that they were met by security personnel at the terminal and told to disembark the plane, and their boarding passes were taken from them. But a source said cabin crew had asked the parents several times to put their child in a seat and fasten his seat belt, but that did not happen and the plane had to return to its gate.

The Caradeuc clan are angry their application for social housing was rejected - because officials discovered they had spent a quarter of a million pounds. Keith Caradeuc, 53, inherited the money from his father\u0027s estate - around \u0026pound500,000 he split with his brother. Dad-of-two Keith admits he bought cars, moved to a nicer rented house, and paid for pricey weight-loss ops for wife Tania Caradeuc, 42.  They inherited the cash in 2015 and say they spent it in less than a year including three new motors, several motorbikes and nearly \u0026pound30,000 on the ops.   But now the Caradeucs, from St Peter Port, Guernsey, say they have no money left to pay their rent and could be made homeless at the end of this month. But benefit officials have rejected their application. Former Sports Direct employee Tania said: I\u0027m just very upset about it, with us being a local family. In hindsight the money should have lasted longer. I was excited when I found out about the money because I came from a not very well-off family and I\u0027ve never seen money like that in my life, it was very overwhelming for both of us. But it\u0027s ruined everything, in a way it was the worst thing that could have happened.  Keith, a former delivery driver, and his brother sold their fathers house in June 2017 and shared approximately \u0026pound420,000 from the sale which topped up their inheritance. Keith and his family had never seen so much money before and went on a spending spree - moving from their council house in St Jacques to a nicer property in St Martin. But their lavish lifestyle ended abruptly in March this year, just nine months after the house sale. Tania said the pair were shocked to realise they had spent around \u0026pound250,000, including the inheritance money and the income from the property sale. She said: I said \u0027what do you mean all the money\u0027s gone, it can\u0027t be?\u0027  Her surgery mostly took place in 2015 and included a gastric sleeve, \u0027tummy tuck\u0027 and loose skin removal. She also had further surgery on her arms in late 2017, bringing the total cost to around \u0026pound29,000. It was Keith\u0027s idea, she said. I lost ten stone, it was for medical reasons, my doctor said I have added years to my life, I wanted to make sure I was around for my children. Some people have acted negatively about that, they have said it was the easy way out, but it hasn\u0027t been easy. Keith or Tania, who have two children, say they are able to work due to mental or physical disabilities. The family still receive disability and carers allowance for one of their daughter\u0027s who has a rare chromosome deficiency condition.  But they don\u0027t have enough income to pay the rent at their new home, and have now applied for a council house. During the application the Caradeuc\u0027s had to supply bank statements and as a result their application was refused due to \u0027depletion of capital\u0027. Tania said: We felt like we had to move from St Jacques when we got the money, and the new house was close to where my daughter goes to school. But we had a nice house in St Jacques, we had friends and we were happy. At first we were excited to move but we didn\u0027t expect it to run out so quickly. Keith is still in recovery, he gets very emotional and has problems with his memory, he can\u0027t find a job as a delivery driver anywhere because of his brain surgery. I have been in bits, I worry about what we are going to do every day.

The pair moved into the home in Bilton, near Hull, with their children in the hope of a better life. But the plague has left them depressed and ruining the dream home they wished for.  More than 200 flies swarm their kitchen every day and some of the insects land on their faces at night, making it difficult to eat and sleep, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  Their house, along with others on the street, is close to the East Hull Community Farm, which the couple blame for the swarms of flies.  The farm says it has never had a complaint about flies and does everything in its power to limit the amount on the farm. But the couple believe livestock and manure bring the flies into their house. We have even been told by one neighbour that they\u0027ve had the problem with flies for the last 20 years, and there must be over 100 people that live down here and are struggling. The couple, who do not wish to be named, said they had health issues arising from the number of flies in their house. Our children have diarrhea from the flies as they are always landing on the food - I daren\u0027t even buy fresh food anymore for fear of the flies getting to it, they said.  This must be the only street that prays for winter - it was 52 degrees in the house the other day as we couldn\u0027t open any of the windows or doors for fear of more flies getting in. We started to decorate when we moved in, but have had to stop as the walls kept constantly getting covered in dead flies and were just covered in blood from where we had splattered them, so it was just a waste of time. The fly problem is affecting the health of the family, and is very traumatic for them.  It is just so horrible and is affecting us all mentally, as well as seeing it and coping with it physically, they said. The infestation is making me depressed and I just can\u0027t stand it going on any longer. It is an absolute joke, the temperature is soaring but we can\u0027t cool down, I don\u0027t want to get up on a morning to have to face it, and I can\u0027t get to sleep on a night as flies are just constantly landing on my face. We were happy to move to a big house with a big garden, but now we just don\u0027t want to be here anymore. We don\u0027t know how to get rid of the problem and have tried calling the farm, Environmental Health and the council, but we just keep getting passed from pillar to post. Hull City Council said: “We were contacted by the resident in July and we requested further information so that we could carry out an investigation into the cause of the problem. The resident supplied us with that information yesterday (August 7). We will be in touch with the resident with the results as soon as we get them. In terms of the cause of the problem, this cannot be determined until we have the results of the investigation.” To try and get rid of the flies, the unhappy couple are having to spend around \u0026pound50 per month on sprays and cleaning products, which is making a real dent into their finances.

Dad-of-three Mike Firth, 31, paid \u0026pound220,000 for a four-bedroom home on the Sycamore Gardens estate in Castleford, West Yorkshire - which was supposed to be a \u0027dream first home\u0027 for his young family when they moved in in April 2017. But Mike claims the dream turned to disaster after he found the house allegedly filled with \u0027shoddy\u0027 building work - which has still not been fixed 16 months on. His 5ft by 3ft sign reads: Thinking of buying a home on this development? Feel free to knock and view my house. The problems are endless and it could save you \u0026pound\u0026pound\u0026pound\u0026pound. #newbuildingnightmare. The HGV compliance controller said: On the walk around we noticed things were wrong. But 16 months later they\u0027ve done little.  I decided to hang the sign because I was getting nowhere. If I\u0027d had seen something like that before I\u0027d bought my house I\u0027d have asked questions. I just want Persimmon to recognise my problems and to sort out the issues I\u0027ve got. All I want is what I paid for but for them to come anywhere near that seems difficult. It\u0027s stressful and it\u0027s frustrating. You buy new, you expect new, we\u0027re far from it.  If I\u0027d have seen the house before I bought it I don\u0027t think I would have done so. The general quality of the work is appalling. Mike claims the property, which he shares with his young son and partner, has ill-fitting brickwork, leaking shower cubicles and baths, poor plaster work and architraves which aren\u0027t level. He also claims brickwork and door frames are below standard.  In July, he took the drastic step of putting a poster up on the front of his house to share his experience with other prospective buyers looking at houses on the estate. Mike added: The brickwork replicates a climbing wall. There are a lot of damaged bricks and it looks sloppy. The woodwork is shoddy too. A number of the architraves and door frames aren\u0027t level. Persimmon have come to do work but then left it unfinished.  It almost feels like they expect the buyer to sort the problems out themselves. I\u0027ve lost count of how many days I\u0027ve taken off for people to come and they\u0027ve either not turned up or not done a very good job. I don\u0027t think it replicates value for money. It feels like the customer comes second. Some of the repair work carried out has been substandard. A spokeswoman for Persimmon Homes told Mail Online: We are currently dealing directly with the customer to address\u0027 issues and are establishing appointments for work to be carried out that coincides with his availability.  has also approached Persimmon for comment.

After the first bone was discovered a police officer banged it against the skip in Bristol city centre and left, thinking it was just a piece of wood, eyewitnesses claimed.  But officers were called back a short time later and a pair of Bristol Post reporters, including one on work experience, found additional remains at the property under renovation.  Police are now investigating to determine whether the bones are human or animal.  A police spokesman said the officer who responded to the initial call examined the first bone to be found, and found it difficult to determine if the very small object was bone or wood. There is believed to be an old cemetery at the building site, police added. A member of the public found the first remains in a skip in Broad Street, near St Nicholas Market, and alerted Avon and Somerset Police around 8am on Thursday.  Sam Ellis, 25, a barista at nearby Full Court Press, said: “A police car stopped down the road with sirens on. The policeman got a bone out of the skip, bashed it on the side and said ‘that’s wood’ and drove off.” Sam added: “The policeman walked off laughing saying ‘it’s just wood’. The guy who dumped it said he was working on renovations nearby. When he was digging out put it was clumped together, he thought it was pipes sticking out. When he threw it in all the soil fell off and we saw it was bones.”  Sam said that Kat North, the wife of the coffee shop\u0027s owner, had previously studied archaeology, and phoned police after examining the skip to tell them that it appeared to contain human bones. Police soon returned and put a black tarpaulin over the skip. Bristol Post reporter Joe Smith and Josiah Wong, who tagged along on work experience, went to the renovation site in nearby All Saints Lane, where they found more bones.  Josiah said: After taking a look at the outside of the building we found a wheelbarrow with three full refuse bags. Among the rubble we discovered more bone shaped items and informed the police officers nearby. Shop owners said the skip only arrived Thursday morning after being swapped for one which had been there for two days.

The mercury dropped to two-month low in parts of the country, down 10C from the start of the week, as heavy downpours and winds of up to 70mph are forecast. Only the southeast of England, which has endured brunt of the heatwave, will see the warm and more settled conditions of the summer. The hot weather came to an abrupt and wet end as the tail end of an Atlantic storm brought torrential rain and thunderstorms to parts of the UK.  Tropical storm Debby strengthened over the far North Atlantic on Wednesday, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour. The storm system formed around 1,200 miles (1931km) east of Boston on Tuesday but is not expected to make landfall in the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Underground staff eventually decided to shut the station due to fears of overcrowding as so many people were trapped in the exit by rising water.  Meanwhile, a mini ‘twister’ was spotted swirling around the skies over Cheshire. The tornado-like cloud formed above Poynton, Bollington and Macclesfield at around lunchtime today. Jennie Lewis snapped the weather phenomenon from her window in Higher Poynton at around 12.15pm. Jennie, 48, said: “I was in my kitchen having an early lunch and it started raining. “We had a really heavy downpour and then I saw this unusual cloud forming. I ran upstairs to grab my camera and by then you could see the rain and cloud twisting. “It looked like something out of a film. The cloud was getting longer but it eventually dissipated. “I’ve always been interested in the weather and this was a really unusual sight.”  Other witnesses said the twister disappeared before it touched the ground. No damage has been reported to the police, a spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said. The Met Office only define a cloud as a tornado if it touches the ground. It is possible the sight was a funnel cloud, which is the same as a tornado - it just doesn’t reach the earth. A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that reaches from the base of a storm cloud to the ground. They happen in unsettled weather conditions, usually as part of thunderstorms. If the rotating column of air does not reach the ground it is a funnel cloud. At the point a funnel cloud reaches the earth’s surface it becomes a tornado, or if it reaches a body of water it becomes a waterspout.

That said, there is never an excuse to turn up shirtless to the office. You\u0027re best off working from home, y\u0027know, in the interests of productivity.  (If you\u0027ve really no option but to go to the office when it\u0027s hot, grab a Simply Motorised Handheld Fan , \u0026pound2, from Halfords and you might stand a chance of making it through the working day.)   2. Commuters were carrying fans  Spare a thought for those who had to commute using public transport during a heatwave. Because heat isn’t really a thing most of the time in the UK, you’re lucky if you can find a bus or train that has the luxury of air conditioning. But hey, you can always crack open a window. That’s definitely just as good. Alternatively, there was this option.     But even drivers can’t escape the heat wave entirely. After an hour parked in the sun, a car interior can hit up to 70 degrees Celsius, which is basically an oven. Or at least it feels like it.   A handy solution to prevent scalding your hands on your steering wheel is the Halfords Essentials Front Windscreen Sunshade , \u0026pound9.99. Its reflective surface will send the sun\u0027s rays back the way they came.   Rear window sunshades will also keep rays off back seat passengers when you\u0027re driving. The Halfords Cling Sunshades at \u0026pound7.20 will help keep temperatures down.  You might feel smug if you’re driving an air conditioned car, but over time they can lose efficiency – so you might not be feeling its maximum effects. Did you know that a car\u0027s air conditioning system can lose up to 10% off its refrigerant every year?  At Halfords there\u0027s a Free Air Con Check available, and they\u0027ll make sure everything is working. If your car needs it, for a small fee the experts at Halfords will be able to top up your air con refrigerant.     Remember 2007 – the wettest summer on record?   Legend has it that it was all the fault of Rhianna, whose hit Umbrella remained at number one for ten weeks. And during that time, it rained. Solidly. The. Whole. Time.  So some people might have stuck that on to see what happens. Meanwhile, the Norwegians believe whistling at the sun will cause rain.      Why not just make the most of the sun while it’s there and head out to the garden for a barbeque. (It would be rude not to when the Halfords Double Stove with Grill is half price at just \u0026pound25.)    Avoid burning yourself as well as the sausages by popping up a Halfords 300 Gazebo , \u0026pound69, (save \u0026pound21), and you\u0027ll not only get some shade, but also UV 50+ protection.   4. Ice lollies for all The best way to keep cool when the sun is shining is, undoubtedly, by enjoying an ice lolly. Just ask this cheetah.

The order, from contractors Wilson James, came after just one customer complaint. Staff have branded the move small-minded.    Mirror columnist and Loose Women star Coleen Nolan launches a passionate defence of affectionate nicknames.   Sweetheart, honeybun, babe – call me any affectionate name you like and keep calling me it.  Hearing that Gatwick staff have been ordered to stop using “love” and “darling” for customers made my eyes roll and heart sink.  Political correctness went mad a long time ago – this is taking it to crazy new levels. Because if people are now offended by the word “love”, there’s no point in getting out of bed in the morning. I give up. A ban isn’t just small-minded, it’s downright pea-brained. What next? Will we be banned from giving people a hug and asking, ‘Are you OK, love?’, when they’re crying? I refuse to go along with that. You’ll have to put gaffer tape on my mouth and handcuffs behind my back. I’ve always called people close to me, or strangers being nice to me, things like “babe”. Pet names are friendly and affectionate. There’s kindness and sweetness behind them and they come from a good place. And they’re quintessentially British. Just as our accents vary wildly between areas just a few miles away, so do our pet names. Growing up in Blackpool, we called each other “love”. My next door neighbours were Scottish and called me “hen”.  Not far away in Stoke they refer to each other as “duck”, Newcastle women are usually “pet” and in Sunderland they’re “flower”. If we’re now expected to stop using these names which say so much about our upbringing, regional identity and tradition, I refuse. There’s ingenuity behind pet names, too. They mask the fact we sometimes forget real names. Maybe that’s why “darling” is used so often in the showbiz world. It’s definitely the reason mum called me “baby”: as the youngest of eight I reckon she often forgot my name. My mum also called me eejit, and I think and hope that was with affection (it’s an Irish thing). I call my two sons “handsome” and daughter “gorgeous” all the time because it’s a term of endearment and I mean it. If I’m called a pet name I feel warm and fuzzy. If an elderly person calls me “love”, I feel young. Colleagues call me “darling” or “love” all the time and it reminds me we have friendship that goes past the formal stage. If a young man calls me “babe”, I feel weak. If pet names like “gorgeous” might be a bit flirty and suggestive, so what? I love harmless flirting. And if builders shout: “Hello sexy!” at me, I’d walk round in circles to hear it again. It doesn’t happen much these days, though. I stand for hours and they don’t even stop their drills.

Lenders such as Wonga and Quick Quid have been accused of dragging their heels on paying back customers charged sky-high rates on short-term loans they had no hope of paying back.   The Financial Conduct Authority ordered the lenders to make amends to borrowers who had been dragged into further debt before a cap was imposed on the industry’s charges in 2014.  But compensation experts claim the firms’ response has been sluggish, with over a million customers still owed payouts over the controversy. Vincent Vernon of Pay Day Refunds said it is handling 32,000 customers claims, a quarter of them with Wonga. He added: “There could be in excess of a million customers who have suffered as a result of irresponsible lending who are owed money back. “Three of the poorest-responding lenders are Wonga, Curo and Quick Quid. These lenders are continuing to ignore UK consumer rights towards their irresponsible lending. They’re fast to lend and extremely slow to repay.” James Walker, from complaints service Resolver, added: “Of all the mis-selling scandals of recent decades, the millions of payday loans flogged to hard-up people struggling to make ends meet is both tragic and outrageous. “Astronomical loans were sold, with little to no checks, leaving desperate people averaging seven loans each at any given time and borrowing to pay off their other loans. Every loan carried huge interest that often made debt worse.”  He claimed firms are shutting down customers’ online accounts to “make it difficult for customers to make claims”. But he added: “The fact that people’s accounts no longer exist online doesn’t mean they lose their right to complain. “As with any other loan, credit or financial product, the firm must keep a record of historic loans, which most do for the statutory six years and often longer.” Wonga said: “We assess customer claims on a case-by-case basis. In line with regulatory standards, it can take up to eight weeks before a claim is processed.” Last week it emerged Wonga had to call on its own financial backers for \u0026pound10million to save it from going bust.

He was drained of colour and appeared to be walking in slow motion towards her. She didn\u0027t know what they had told him, but she knew it wasn\u0027t good news. Renae had just had an MRI scan to be on the safe side while trying to find the cause of her crippling headache. But as her husband Jared walked towards her in the hospital waiting room, her life - and his - changed forever. We both just looked at each and cried, she told MamaMia . As it turned out, her \u0027migraine\u0027 was a tumour. I was told if I had left it another 24 hours I would be dead, added the 39-year-old, who lives in Australia.  Renae had been in the waiting room for a while, awaiting the results of the scan, when she started feeling sick. With her head pounding, she sent Jared to tell doctors that they were going home because she wanted to crawl into bed. But in the minutes that followed, she found out she would not be getting into bed as she had hoped.  Instead, she was rushed to the emergency department at a nearby hospital. Days earlier, she had rung her twin sister Nicole, who suffers from migraines, to see if she had any suggestions on how to cure her thumping headache that she\u0027d had four days straight. She described it as being annoying more than painful and usual remedies hadn\u0027t worked. Nicole suggested Renae contact her GP believing it may be a migraine, which are common in their family.  The GP suggested the MRI scan as Renae had never suffered such severe headaches before. But no one expected it to uncover she had a massive tumour - and that she had only 24 hours left to live. Renae spent the next five days in hospital having multiple scans while being monitored around the clock. Following an operation and 19 staples in the back of her head , the tumour was removed. But the worst was still to come. Renae was allowed home but was told not to do everyday tasks such as drive, cook or lift anything too heavy. Then five days later, fluid began leaking from the area she had been operated on and more surgery followed. She spent more than a week confined to her bed, unable to move without warning a nurse first.  This was the hardest of all of it, Renae said, writing on a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the cost of her medical treatment. I cried so much. I felt completely helpless. For the first time, I was scared and nervous about what was happening to me. It was then that Renae was given the devastating melanoma cancer diagnosis - despite religiously lathering herself in sun cream throughout her life. She was told it had no known primary source and had the Braf gene. In the words of the oncologists \u0027it has its foot on the accelerator,\u0027 she said. It was suggested to Renae she take a combination of drugs to \u0027buy her time\u0027. How much? No one can tell you, she said. According to the oncologist \u0027some people live, some people die. We don’t know why some do and some don’t\u0027.  And devastatingly a few weeks ago, another large tumour was found at the back of Renae\u0027s brain, along with three to four smaller ones. She was forced to undergo another operation to try and remove them, despite being told the treatment had been working and another tumour had shrunk to be almost non-existant. I was in the intensive care unit overnight and for much of the next day before being moved into my own private room again. I suffered severe and regular nausea and vomiting, she said. This is completely devastating news as there were no signs that my treatment wasn\u0027t working. The MRI scans were being performed less frequently as the tumours had been shown to be shrinking each time. It really feels like reliving it all over again from the beginning again.

He is strong in the air and a powerful player.“He is one of the best players in the air I have worked with.“He’s not Messi or Maradona but he’s a very hard worker and as a box player is excellent. I think he is perfect for Scottish football.“When I signed him before he was very good for me and he got his move to Aalborg on the back of that.“He has trained with us now but he is still a player at Aalborg so it is in the hands of the two clubs.”Safranko made 28 appearances for AaB last season but has dropped to the bench for the early games of this term after a formation change.That’s prompted him to seek a regular starting place elsewhere in a bid to add to his two Slovakia caps and he sees teaming up with his old boss again as the perfect way to achieve that.Although United have not ruled out a move for Austrian attacker Toni Vastic after his trial last week, with Safranko not coming cheap, that now looks unlikely.Csaba, meanwhile, has apologised to fans for his team’s poor showing in Saturday’s defeat against Dunfermline.He’s made it clear the display that led to three second half goals being conceded at Tannadice was unacceptable.“I have to apologise to the fans, for all the people who like and love Dundee United, for the performance and the result on Saturday.“The second half was nowhere near good enough, it wasn’t acceptable,” he added.“It was not what the fans, the staff and even the players wanted.“The players told me, gaffer we have to go and really tell everybody sorry but I take the responsibility.“Of course, we know every team can lose games but we know we should not lose like we did in the match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united have to start getting it right from now on says edjenguele","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith so many changes to the squad taking place over the summer, experienced defender William Edjenguele knows it was always going to take new-look Dundee United time to gel.However, the experience the 31-year-old has amassed over his career and, in particular, of life in the Championship over the past two seasons with the Tangerines, tells him they better find a way to do it quickly.Like every other United player, the big Frenchman was gutted by Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline in their league opener.It goes without saying that loss was not what the incumbents of the Tannadice dressing-room wanted or expected.“It was the first game of the season and at home, so you want to start well and that’s what we didn’t do,” he said.“In the first half we didn’t play particularly well but we managed to get the first goal and it looked the kind of game where the team who got it would be the winner.“And I thought in the first half, while we were not playing that well, neither team was. However, we were showing togetherness and real fight.“Second half there were a few mistakes and that cost us the game.“We were a bit unlucky as well because there was a handball in the move for their second goal and it should have been a foul for us.“You can’t use that as an excuse because he (the referee) did not give it and you have to defend the situation.”Neither will Edjenguele use the vast changes to the squad over the summer to deflect from what fans had a right to expect to be a much better start.The weekend saw nine men in tangerine making their league debuts for the club.That meant only two of the team that beat the Pars over two legs in the promotion play-off quarter-final just last May, were involved in the United starting line-up.Having been at eight clubs in his 13-year senior career, he knows better than most that any new group needs time to get to know each other and that’s definitely the case at Tannadice where he’s never seen so many comings and goings in such a short period.He’s well aware, however, that, while that process could take two or three months, it cannot be at the expense of results.“Definitely it will take time. I don’t even know how many players exactly came in but it was a lot.“There were a lot of changes, so we definitely need some time to gel together.“And I should say I do respect Dunfermline. They are a good side, especially going forward, and they have some decent players. So if you don’t play well they can beat you.“At home you expect us to do a bit better than that. Everybody is disappointed but we have to go again.“It was a hard day but we have to make sure we are better right away because the one thing that you find out is the season goes by fast and we have to be ready to go quickly.“We have to play better, starting with the next game. It’s as simple as that.”After the struggles of the Betfred Cup group that saw United come out on top in just one of their four ties and even then only after they already knew they were out of the competition, it’s fair to say many supporters feared the worst going into the Dunfermline clash.Edjenguele, though, insists the players had been in confident mood.The feeling was they were coming together as a team and would be ready for the opening 90 minutes of league action. That, of course, only made defeat more painful.“Some of the results in the cup were not good until the Elgin game,” he said.“We were making progress and things were moving in the right direction, so this was a real setback.“Like I say, now we must work to make sure we are ready this week.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united kids earn scotland call up to face england and turkey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThree of Dundee United’s academy youngsters have been chosen to represent Scotland in the upcoming U/16 matches against England and Turkey.Midfielders Christopher Mochrie and Lewis Neilson and defender Adam Hutchison are included by Scotland coach Billy Stark.The game against the English will take place on August 20 at 3pm and the meeting with the Turks kicks off two days later.Both are to be played at the English FA’s St George’s Park complex.United’s senior academy manager Brian Grant said: “It is great to see these three lads rewarded for their hard work and application.

Thanks.”The firm was reportedly liquidated last Friday.Teejay – which takes its name from the initials of its director, Thomas Jordan – had operated routes in Angus including the 43/43A loop around Arbroath.It was also in charge of the 78A and 79A services that linked Dundee with Monikie, Monifieth, Ethiebeaton and Kellas.Teejay’s latest accounts revealed assets totalling just over £56,000 as of the end of 2017.Stagecoach East Scotland has arranged with Angus Council to take over Teejay’s routes until a permanent operator can be found.A spokeswoman for the council said: “We can confirm that we have arranged for Stagecoach to operate the local bus contracts in the short term.”Douglas Robertson, commercial director at Stagecoach East Scotland, said: “As a result of the recent administration of local bus operator Teejay Travel, we were asked by Angus Council to step in to cover the contracts previously operated by Teejay.“We are delighted to be able to provide the resource in order to operate these contracts on behalf of the local authority, ensuring customers see no disruption to their travel.”Teejay Travel could not be reached for further comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b69627bdece2-448x564.jpg ","title":"tom duthie patience and time in short supply for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the dust settles on a disappointing opening-day result against Dunfermline at Tannadice, a few moments’ calm reflection could lead to the conclusion all this Dundee United squad needs to be Championship contenders is a little time and patience.Give Csaba Laszlo’s rebuilt squad a few more weeks to gel and they could be a strong force at this level.And a little patience during those weeks to forgive mistakes that are probably inevitable would help with that process.So much for the theory, now for the harsh reality. It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things. There is a backlog of things which need to be done.\"The trust is raising the mausoleum\u0027 profile online and via social media thanks to the volunteer efforts of Mr Lundberg\u0027 student daughter who studies away from home.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Mr Lundberg believes much more could be done with the development of the website and an app.\"We really need to have better interpretation of the building,\" he said. \"At Culloden Battlefield, they have got display panels and we would like something similar for the mausoleum.\"He estimated the cost of renovation and improved interpretation would come to about \u0026pound100,000.\"It is going to need a serious fundraising exercise,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe welcomed the recent award of \u0026pound36,000 from Highland Council for work in the graveyard including urgent repairs to structures such as perimeter walls and gravestones.It also includes the removal of several trees including six dead elms.

Sir Alex Ferguson took chances with the Class of ’92 at Manchester United and he took chances playing young kids at Aberdeen.“He gave Eric Black, John Hewitt and others their chance and they came through.“It would be good to see another striker like Bruce come through because if you’re good enough, you’re old enough, in my opinion.”Dons gaffer McInnes is still hoping to sign another striker before the transfer window closes at the end of the month – and ideally he would like another frontman in before Saturday’s game with Dundee.With Adam Rooney leaving the Granite City for Salford City earlier in the summer, Aberdeen have two senior strikers in Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove.May, a £400,000 signing from Preston North End a year ago, struggled in his first campaign – particularly after an injury sustained in December against Rangers after a bad tackle from Ryan Jack, while Cosgrove – who joined in January from Carlisle – is only 20 and has yet to score in a competitive game for the Dons.McDougall joined Aberdeen in 1984 from St Mirren and helped the Reds win the Premier Division title in 1985 and the League Cup and Scottish Cup the following season.After his goal-laden time at Pittodrie, he was forced to retire in 1987, aged 29, due to injury.McDougall believes McInnes is right to try to add another striker and believes the goals of Rooney need to be replaced.He also reckons it’s important Aberdeen bide their time and wait for the right attacker to become available.McDougall added: “I think they need another striker added to their squad. Derek McInnes knows that and is working on it they lost Adam Rooney to Salford and his goals need replaced.“They need more firepower up front than what they have at the moment.“I just don’t see enough goals in the senior strikers. I’d love to see it but I feel they need a little bit more.“There have been encouraging signs for the season – they did well against Burnley in the Europa League and Lewis Ferguson looks a good player – but I would like to see another striker signed.“You can get strikers but Aberdeen don’t want to take in anybody, they need somebody with a bit of class because they want to keep moving forward.“Derek’s resources are limited so he’s right to wait for the right striker because he wants to make the right decision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens techfest celebrates 25th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA science and technology festival which has inspired hundreds of thousands of youngsters for 25 years is poised to return to Aberdeen.TechFest aims to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Along with interactive workshops, shows and presentations, people will get a chance to hear from former Olympic curler Jackie Lockhart.She will share stories from her career alongside manager of Curl Aberdeen and fellow champion curler Tom Brewster, who will provide technical insight into how the maintenance of ice can affect the outcome of a match.As part of its milestone year, in addition to a range of science topics on offer, there will also be a variety of events exploring the history and uses of silver.National Museums Scotland will also present key objects from its touring exhibition, with Behind The Scenes of Scotland’s Early Silver: From Conservation to Display on September 12.Sarah Chew, managing director of TechFest, said: “This is a really exciting year for TechFest as we celebrate 25 years of the festival and we are pleased to unveil such a diverse and fun-filled programme for our anniversary.“Over the years you can imagine how the event has changed.“If you look at the programme in 2001, we were following the possibility of water on Mars pretty closely.“And in that area, there has been massive discoveries and now we see in 2018 that life on Mars is much closer than we realised at the time.“There’s the story of a woman who is now a nursery manager and used to come to TechFest as a kid – and now she’s one of our presenters who helps us to be on the cutting edge.”Sarah added: “Once again we have some of the brightest minds and biggest personalities in the Stem sphere presenting, as well as musicians and sporting personalities who can demonstrate how Stem plays a role in their disciplines too.“A lot has changed since we first launched as a charity in 1995.“However, our ethos of inspiring, educating and entertaining people of all ages has remained the same and we can’t wait to welcome everyone.

I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dancer wins big at southend games","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 7:13 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTen-year-old Olivia Veitch was celebrating with her family after an amazing performance at Southend Games.The highland dancer won first place in Highland Laddie, Barracks Johnnie and Reel of Tulloch and second place in Seann Triubhas and Highland Fling, also winning the overall intermediate section.The dancer from Lochgilphead dances at the James McCorkindale School of Dancing in Campbeltown.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sea unites the story of inverarays ferry","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 8:55 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Colin CameronMuch of the detail in this feature comes from two booklets written by the late Donald MacKechnie, the well-known Inveraray schoolmaster and local historian.The booklets, \u0026#8216Inveraray Notes\u0026#8217 and \u0026#8216Inveraray Tales and Traditions\u0026#8217, were published in the 1980s.Look out for tales from these fascinating booklets in coming editions of the Argyllshire Advertiser.As a starter, we turn to links across Loch Fyne, and the Inveraray-St Catherines ferry.Based on information by Donald MacKechnieFrom the Middle Ages until 1963 a ferry sailed between Inveraray and St Catherines \u0026#8211 one of seven similar services up and down Loch Fyne linking Cowal and Mid Argyll. Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

They had been directed to a council bus park in Ayr by a policeman, only to have access blocked. Entry to the coach park is via an intercom and barrier – but nobody was answering. Now veteran driver Ian Jackson warned: “The town must get its act together or visitors will go elsewhere.” He led a convoy of three coaches nearly 60 miles from Whitburn in West Lothian. The 53-seater coaches dropped off their passengers outside Pirate Pete’s on the Esplanade last Monday. And Ian,73, of Wishaw, said: “A policeman told us to turn right towards the harbour as there was a coach park there. “We all turned off the esplanade and arrived at the coach park where there was a barrier with an intercom. “I spent 20 minutes pressing it with no answer. “It mean’t all three buses had to reverse out of the street and we had to drive out of the town. We all don’t understand how the council can be so stupid. “The turn-in for buses more than 13 metres long is narrow because of a foot-and-a-half traffic island anyway, so it was chaos reversing out. “Next time the visits might have to be to Largs or somewhere else that can properly cater for us. “These trips can be worth a lot of money for the towns we visit and it is usually a great day out.” There are 20 coach bays behind the car park in Cromwell Road and it has a barrier entrance. Ian also claims he hung on the phone for 25 minutes trying to reach South Ayrshire Council. Ian added: “I was ninth in the queue and I kept on holding I was so incensed. “When I got through they simply said they were not the roads department and I had to call another number. “What a mess.” South Ayrshire Council confessed officials knew there was a problem ... and alleged there were “alternative arrangements”. A spokesman said: “There is an issue with the entrance barrier at the coach park on Cromwell Road and work will be carried out to fix the problem. In the meantime, there are alternative arrangements in place for buses to access the coach park and we’re sorry if these did not work on this occasion.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilWishawWest LothianWhitburnLargs"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13056653.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_280417wind_23JPG.jpg","title":"mexican standoff power company giants","story":"NewsMexican standoff with power company giantsFurious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston14:39, 9 AUG 2018NewsPat Spence at Dochroyale Farm near Barrhill, is surrounded by wind farms (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA determined woman is refusing to hand over expensive wind farm monitoring equipment to an energy giant. Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonSchoolsUniversities and CollegesEducationAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-goes-extreme-with-town-centre-stunt-team","story":"EXPECT a few thrills and spills in Galashiels later this month as community leaders hit top gear.\nBusiness group BID Galashiels has organised a day of high-octane fun in and around the town centre on Saturday, August 25.\nAnd taking centre stage will be the dare-devil riders and skaters from Team Extreme.\nOn top of the professional stunt displays in Bank Street Gardens, there will be a seven-metre high climbing wall and a gladiator duel arena.\nA live music stage will make sure the thrilling spectacle has the perfect soundtrack.\nAnd for the energetic there will be Zumba and Spin Bike sessions with Live Borders.\nSeveral buskers have also been booked to make sure the day goes with a swing.\nCo-organiser Andrew Poole told the Border : \"We\u0027re incredibly excited to be bringing a professional stunt team to Galashiels.\n\"This is a real first.\n\"Team Extreme perform daredevil stunts throwing themselves sometimes twenty foot into the air on their skateboards and BMX bikes.\n\"This alone promises to be an exciting spectacle to watch.\n\"Add into that the other attractions on the day with the climbing wall, the gladiator duel arena, a live music stage and demonstrations of Zumba and Spin Bikes, the whole day is shaping up to be something very unique for Galashiels and a whole lot of fun for everyone.\n\"And importantly, everything on the day is free.\"\nThe event is the latest venture from BID Galashiels in an effort to create improved trading and business for the town.\nAndrew added: \"BID For Galashiels is a business community led organisation seeking to establish a Business Improvement District for Galashiels town centre.\n\"Part of that project is to demonstrate to local businesses how we can improve footfall and visitors to the town.\n\"This event is just one example of how we may be able to do that on a more regular basis, if the business owners vote positively for a BID to be established when they are balloted in November this year.\"\nThe fun day will run from 11am until 4pm and will be supported by a live outside broadcast from Radio Borders.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"last-blast-for-cheltenham-bound-selkirk-silver-band","story":"SELKIRK Silver Band is staging a special summer concert in the marquee at Haining House on Sunday, August 19.\nIt will be the band\u0026rsquos final public appearance before it heads to Cheltenham for next month\u0026rsquos UK national brass band championships.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a very exciting time for our members, said bandmaster Colin Kemp, \u0026ldquoand naturally the band wants to do everyone in Selkirk proud when it plays at the national finals in September.\n\u0026ldquoWe receive tremendous support from the local community throughout the year, and this month\u0026rsquos concert gives us the chance to show our appreciation for all the public\u0026rsquos help and encouragement.\nIn recent weeks band members have been busy raising funds to enable them to make the trip to Cheltenham.\nAs well running a pop-up shop and hosting a stall at last month\u0026rsquos farmers\u0026rsquo market, a commemorative brochure has been produced charting the band\u0026rsquos 121-year history.\nThe Haining concert will comprise a wide-ranging musical programme.

\u0027at-risk\u0027 mountain-growing fir.\nDawyck curator Graham Stewart told us: \"As home to an internationally-important tree collection, we spend a considerable amount of time on arboreal tasks.\n\"The tree in question, an Abies koreana or Korean fir, is one of a very handsome species occurring naturally in the higher mountains of South Korea at altitudes of around 1500 metres.\n\"The reason it was moved dates back to an error during propagation when it was mislabelled.\n\"It had then been planted out along with its \u0026lsquofriends\u0026rsquo but in time turned out to be the odd one out.\n\"In order to clear up the issue of it being in the wrong place we took the decision to move it somewhere more appropriate.\"\nHaving now been replanted in a more appropriate location with the picturesque gardens, the Korean fir appears to have happily taken root.\nAnd Mr Stewart admits the move proved popular with the many visitors.\nHe added: \"It appears quite happy in its new home.\n\"Visitors seem to enjoy watching this kind of activity and it is a great way to start conversations about what we do and why we do it.\"\nAfter a busy summer at the botanical garden, staff at Dawyck are gearing up for a busy autumn.\nA packed-programme of events are planned, including on Sunday, September 16 when mycologist Neville Kilkenny, an expert in the distinct kingdom of fungi, will explain where to look for different species, characteristics to learn - and what to avoid.\nFrom Friday, August 12 until Friday, November 30, Out of the Ark into the Woods, is a new exhibition by

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.  Housing services will continue to be dealt\u0026nbspwith at Aldhammer House.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chernobyl-children-enjoy-a-special-pets-experience","story":"  The Ormiston-based organisation has been working with the Chernobyl Children\u0026rsquos Lifeline Trust and Swiis Foster Care to provide youngsters from Belarus with a special workshop as they visited the UK as part of a month-long recuperative holiday provided each year.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The three-week intensive course will allow Maya to gain membership of the NYT and access to the opportunities it provides for roles and productions in the future.  However, Maya, who has a genetic muscle disorder which affects her spine, said she will need to find extra funds to take a full-time carer along with her for the duration of the course.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe course starts in the middle of August for three weeks and is an amazing opportunity for me to develop as an actor and gain membership onto the NYT company, which opens up a world full of acting auditions and opportunities.  \u0026ldquoDuring the course I will be staying in student accommodation in London, which will be a really memorable and exciting way for me to make new friendships and learn new life skills by living away from home however, because I will need physical help throughout the trip with my personal care and other needs, I\u0026rsquom going to have to employ a live-in carer to come with me to London.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom also going to have to pay for an additional room in the accommodation which will more than double the amount that is normally spent on the course by an able-bodied member.  \u0026ldquoAll together, the total cost of the trip including my carer\u0026rsquos extra costs/wages will come to over \u0026pound3,000!  \u0026ldquoDue to the fact that these funds cannot be met by my council or the National Youth Theatre, I have resorted to setting up a GoFundMe page to try and raise funds and donations to be able to go on the trip.

He just got on with it, whatever they threw at him, he just got on with it.  Dennis, who had lived in North Berwick for more than 45 years, previously worked at the Ben Sayers factory and North Berwick\u0026rsquos Co-op store.

Now Kirsty is getting ready to take the plunge and make her way down the iconic lighthouse on September 22 in memory of her dad, who lived on the town\u0026rsquos Lochbridge Road.  Kirsty, 41, who will be joined by her brother Steven Baron and sister-in-law Lorna, son Kieran and daughter Gemma, as well as other close family and friends, told the Courier she was so scared of heights that she could not even cross the Forth Road Bridge or climb North Berwick Law.

Evidence from\u0026nbsp129,000 firms across 18 industry sectors in the report showed the importance of migration at all skill levels, said CBI deputy director-general\u0026nbspJosh Hardie.  He called for \u0026ldquoblunt targets to be axed to enable companies to hire the staff they need.  \u0026ldquoThis is no longer a theoretical debate, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about the future of our nation.

The Trust says 270 square miles of potential lynx habitat has been approved for a five-year trial involving a first release of six animals fitted with state-of-the-art GPS collars to monitor their movements.  If successful, it could lead to a wider reintroduction of the carnivorous cats in other parts of the UK, such as Argyll and Inverness-shire.  The trust has already identified an area of \u0026ldquosuitable lynx habitat covering over 10,000 square miles, as close as 30 miles to Glasgow, and consultation is already under way with several major landowners.  Supporters of the reintroduction of lynx say the native species would bring a range of benefits including helping to control deer through direct predation and by keeping deer herds moving through the forestry.  Analysis of similar projects in Europe suggests the animals could also help generate tens of millions of pounds in tourism.  Dr Paul O\u0026rsquoDonoghue, chief scientific adviser for the Lynx UK Trust, said: \u0026ldquoI think this (support from landowners) speaks volumes for the confidence in the trial reintroduction plan we\u0026rsquove laid out, and the potential it has for improving the local ecosystem and expanding the local tourist economy. Literally every landowner we have approached has given permission.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove got an incredible team of ecologists, four wildlife vets and highly experienced reintroduction specialists ready to start work, with a combined 300 years of experience between them.  \u0026ldquoThis will be an exceptionally rigorous, scientifically-led reintroduction trial using cutting edge technology to monitor these cats in stunning detail.  \u0026ldquoEverything is in place to deliver a project that will breathe life into Britain\u0026rsquos dying forest ecosystems.  Dr O\u0026rsquoDonoghue said that while the proposed release site is in Northumberland, it was a \u0026ldquocross-border project that could see lynx involved in the trial cross in to Scotland.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a cross-border site. Landowners on the Scottish and English sides have given access so lynx could be on Scottish soil. But we are also assessing Scottish sites in the Highlands and we see this trial as a precursor to rolling out a larger introduction in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is fantastic habitat as close as 30 miles from Glasgow, from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs into the West Highlands and the Great Glen. Lynx specialise on roe deer, of which Scotland has a massive overabundance \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a massive larder for the lynx."},{"url":null,"title":"document-suggests-snp-ministers-did-not-support-a-permanent-fracking-ban","story":"  Previously unseen papers state ministers do not \u0026ldquosupport the notion of a permanent ban because technology could improve and public attitudes may shift in the future.

He added: \"Moreover, there will be more than a few eyebrows raised in the communities who were promised that the threat of fracking had been removed, only to find out that the Government\u0027s promise potentially came with an asterisk attached.\"  Ministers introduced a moratorium on fracking, which involves pumping water and chemicals at high pressure into shale beds to release gas, in 2015.  Research found it could be worth an estimated \u0026pound1.2 billion to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy over the period to 2062, but critics argue it contributes to climate change and poses a public health risk.  Official documents released under Freedom of Information, written just days before energy minister Paul Wheelhouse outlined the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos final position on fracking in October, detail how ministers planned to announce their \u0026ldquocarefully considered judgement.  It said the Government does not back the development of a fracking industry in Scotland.  But it adds that Mr Wheelhouse should \u0026ldquoset out that the Scottish Government does not support the notion of a permanent ban as it is impossible to predict with any certainty what kind of clean energy technologies may be available in the decades to come, or future public attitudes.  Mr Wheelhouse made no mention of this in his statement to MSPs less than two weeks later. Instead, he said fracking had been \u0026ldquoeffectively banned, adding: \u0026ldquoThe decision that I am announcing means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.  Challenged by Green MSP Mark Ruskell over whether this amounted to a permanent ban, Mr Wheelhouse said he was \u0026ldquotaken aback and suggested Mr Ruskell had not been listening.  He went on: \u0026ldquoI give reassurance \u0026ndash I tried to make it crystal clear in my statement \u0026ndash that there is, in effect, a ban on unconventional oil and gas activities in Scotland.  Earlier this year, a Scottish Government lawyer told a court it had not in fact banned fracking, insisting this was \"the language of a press statement\". It said the policymaking process is still ongoing, while ministers had simply announced \"a preferred position\".  Opponents accused the SNP of hedging its bets instead of implementing a real ban.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos environment spokesperson Claudia Beamish MSP said it was time for the SNP to \"respect the vote of the Scottish Parliament and show its clear commitment to a real ban of on-shore fracking in Scotland.  Mr Ruskell said: \"The change in tone between the Sir Humphrey-style hedge-your-bets briefing and Paul Wheelhouse\u0027s bullish statement shows that SNP ministers knew that they could sit on the fence no longer.\"  Dr Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said there was \u0026ldquoclearly a lot of furious debate within the Government in the days leading up to the announcement of a ban.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted that fracking cannot take place in Scotland but we want the Scottish Government to go beyond the current ban in policy and enact a water-tight ban in law.  A Government spokesman said the \u0026ldquohandling plan was written by officials to provide recommendations, adding that Mr Wheelhouse \u0026ldquodid not agree with the specific recommendation referred to, and so did not include it in his statement.  He added: \u0026ldquoAs Mr Wheelhouse has repeatedly made clear in parliament, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos preferred position is not to support unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland. This position has been endorsed by MSPs of all parties and we are currently completing the Strategic Environmental Assessment of our preferred policy.  He said the Government had not been opposed to a permanent ban when the document was written, but did not explain how this continued to be included in the handling plan, weeks after ministers had met to discuss their stance."},{"url":null,"title":"marie-curie-named-most-significant-woman-in-history","story":"  In a reader poll conducted by BBC History Magazine of the 100 women who changed the world, the pioneering scientist came out on top, above the likes of Margaret Thatcher, Diana, Princess of Wales, Emmeline Pankhurst and the Virgin Mary.  The Polish-born French scientist, who became the first person to win two Nobel prizes - one for physics and one for chemistry - carried out important research into radioactivity, a term that she coined.  Her discoveries launched effective cures for cancer and helped in the development of X-rays in surgery.  The magazine asked experts in 10 different fields of human endeavour to each nominate 10 women they believe had the biggest impact, to create the list of 100 women for readers to choose from.  Curie\u0027s nominee, Patricia Fara, president of the British Society for the History of Science, said: \"She (Curie) was the first woman to win a Nobel prize in physics, first female professor at the University of Paris, and the first person - note the use of person there, not woman - to win a second Nobel prize.  \"The odds were always stacked against her. In Poland her patriotic family suffered under a Russian regime. In France she was regarded with suspicion as a foreigner - and of course, wherever she went, she was discriminated against as a woman.\"  The top 100 women were chosen for their achievements in areas including politics, science, sport, technology and literature, and saw the likes of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Dame Jenni Murray and historians Suzannah Lipscomb and Tom Holland among those putting together the shortlist.  In second place was Rosa Parks, an activist in the civil rights movement who protested against racial segregation in America, with leader of the British suffragette movement Pankhurst third.  As well as Curie, scientist Ada Lovelace, a computer programmer and mathematician, and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin made the top 20, in fourth and fifth places respectively.  The UK\u0027s first female Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, is in sixth place, while Diana, Princess of Wales, is at number 15.  Other names in the top 20 include writers Mary Wollstonecraft and Jane Austen, aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and queens Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  BBC History Magazine deputy editor Charlotte Hodgman said: \"The poll has shone a light on some truly extraordinary women from history, many of whose achievements and talents were overlooked in their own lifetimes.  \"It is fitting that, in a year that has seen the 100th anniversary of the parliamentary Act that gave the vote to many British women, suffrage campaigners Emmeline Pankhurst and Josephine Butler have been voted into the top 20.  \"Whilst it is unsurprising to see queens such as Victoria and Eleanor of Aquitaine place high, it is refreshing to see some more unfamiliar names make the top 20, such as 19th-century philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts.

But she insisted the proposals will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and set the UK on course for a \u0026ldquoproductive relationship with the remaining 27-member EU.  The letter, obtained by the ConservativeHome website, came as it emerged Mrs May is considering calling a top-level summit of Cabinet ministers early in September as part of the process of stepping up preparations for a possible \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit.  A slew of polls taken since the Cabinet summit in Chequers suggest unhappiness among large swathes of Tory members with Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans, with many preferring the no-deal option.  The PM has already attempted to allay concerns by inviting Conservative Association chairs to Downing Street and taking part in a conference call to discuss her plans.

It features six bedrooms and bathrooms, two lounges, a cinema room, a gym, a wine room, plus four acres of grounds, including a one and a half acre lake stocked with more than 2,000 fish.  Current owners Nigel and Melanie Walsh said a difficult property market, Brexit and Stamp Duty were hurdles to achieving a sale, so after nine months decided to adopt a creative approach.  Raffling off the property at \u0026pound13.50 a ticket after being inspired by similar competitions, Ms Walsh, 65, said it is a \u0026ldquogrand old house in lovely surroundings.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to move on, and it will be heart wrenching because this is a part of me\u0026hellip it has been a joy, we have had some great fun, she told the Press Association.  \u0026ldquoThere is just the two of us now \u0026ndash 7,500 square feet for two people \u0026ndash I mean it is funny, but it is crazy, we just don\u0026rsquot fill it anymore, she said.  \u0026ldquoI just got the feeling the house needed a new family, a new chapter.

Located just 14 miles from central London, it is within easy access of the capital\u0026rsquos major airports and has been recently renovated.  Ms Walsh said the property has appeared in the children\u0026rsquos television show ChuckleVision, and the 1999 adaptation of Great Expectations was also filmed there.  And in its former lifetime, it has also been used as a school and by the Army as Camp 33 to house Italian prisoners of war in the grounds.  The couple, who have been married for 42 years, have also held birthdays, family gatherings and even their son\u0026rsquos wedding at their property.  Asked who she would like to win the competition, Ms Walsh said: \u0026ldquoSomeone who will love it as much as we have.  \u0026ldquoThe people who are buying tickets and entering, I hope and I really mean this sincerely, that they are looking forward to winning Dancers Hill House.  \u0026ldquoI would like to see it go to a family who are going to cherish it and have as much fun as we have, and I hope we succeed.

Campbell died aged 45 on Coniston Water in the Lake District in January 1967 when the boat, travelling at more than 300mph, flipped into the air and disintegrated as he attempted to beat his own water speed record.  The restored hydroplane, which was recovered from the lake in 2001, has been undergoing tests at speed on Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute.  Asked if any world record speed attempts were planned, Mr Smith said: \u0026ldquoThat would be incredibly foolish.  \u0026ldquoYou saw what happened last time.

Nah.  He has spent 22 years restoring the boat, which has a new jet engine, along with volunteers but said the history was not at the forefront of his mind when she re-entered the water for the first time in more than half a century at the weekend.  He said: \u0026ldquoI just wanted to know that she wasn\u0026rsquot filling up with water and about to land on the bottom with her tail fin sticking above the surface.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos all I wanted to see.

He hinted that the historic boat could become a regular visitor to the island, once this month\u0026rsquos test runs are over.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod come back and do it every year, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos like going on holiday with my mates and bringing a boat along for a laugh.

He said archive footage has enabled the team to mirror Campbell\u0026rsquos progress.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos pretty interesting to see the boat is peforming in a pretty similar way to when Donald Campbell had it.  Campbell\u0026rsquos body, with his race suit still intact, was pulled from the Cumbria lake along with the wreckage in 2001.

Ms Sturgeon is due to update Holyrood on her plans for a referendum in October.  Last year, after resetting her original plans after SNP general election losses, she said she would set out a \u0026ldquoprecise timetable in the autumn.  However with continued confusion over the terms of Brexit and potential delays in talks, she admitted this week that she didn\u0026rsquot know what she would say.  Speaking to the BBC in Aberdeen, Mr Wheelhouse was asked about the likelihood of a second referendum being called in the current circumstances.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe First Minister said she will review the situation in October.  \u0026ldquoClearly, the chances of that happening are higher the more the UK government pushes us down a line of no deal and cutting our ties to\u0026hellip the European single market.  \u0026ldquoPeople who are not necessarily sympathetic to the SNP are increasingly angry with the position the UK government has taken and the risk of a \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo is focusing people\u0027s minds on perhaps the better opportunities there may be through independence.\"  The pound rebounded on Thursday after a report EU leaders were mulling a compromise that would avoid a no-deal by letting the UK opt out of free movement, but stay in the single market for goods.  However the idea came with a big catch.  In return for the EU dropping its resistance to cherry picking parts of the single market, the UK would have to replicate all future EU rules on environment, customs and social protection.  As this would effectively prevent the UK \u0026ldquotaking back control, the trade-off is unlikely to be backed by Westminster, but it does at least suggest an openness to new thinking.  Meanwhile, Theresa May has been forced to reassure Conservative party members that her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit is not a sell-out to Brussels.  In a three-page letter addressing the \u0026ldquostrong feelings in the rank and file, the Prime Minister insisted her proposals were \u0026ldquoin no sense a concession to the EU.  However she also said Brexit \u0026ldquorequires pragmatism and compromise from both sides.  The exercise, estimated to have cost the Tory party around \u0026pound70,000, comes amid a grassroots backlash to the Chequers deal, which would see the UK maintain a common rule book with the EU on goods and agri-foods, but diverge on services and migration.  David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary after the plan was agreed last month, and it has been criticised by other Brexiters as a betrayal.  Mrs May admitted \u0026ldquoparty members have raised a number of questions about her plan for a bespoke deal, and she wanted to \u0026ldquoaddress them directly.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know that some people are concerned that this common rule book will stop us doing trade deals. I can assure you that this is not the case - and I would not be proposing it if it would.  She acknowledged a common rule book \u0026ldquowould mean we could not drop our regulatory standards for goods in new trade deals with other countries, but said the government didn\u0026rsquot want to do that anyway, as it wanted to \u0026ldquoprotect British consumers.  \u0026ldquoI am well aware of the strong feelings members of our Party have on this national issue.  In recent weeks, Downing Street has held briefing sessions for Tory branch chairs, with Mrs May taking part in a conference call Q\u0026ampA with association chairmen.

She said: \u0026ldquoI remain clear that no deal is better than a bad deal - and we are stepping up our \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo preparations.

It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells in the retina.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, AMD can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.  Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.  The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set a chain of reactions that leads to toxic chemical molecules to be created in the photoreceptor cells.  Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: \u0026ldquoIf you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.  \u0026ldquoPhotoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they\u0026rsquore dead, they\u0026rsquore dead for good.  The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.  They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cell.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThe retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.  The scientists found that a molecule called alpha tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThat is when the real damage occurs.  For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.  The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports."},{"url":null,"title":"everything-samsung-announced-at-its-unpacked-event","story":"  The technology giant introduced its Galaxy Note 9 smartphone as an \u0026ldquoall-day battery device capable of handling even heavy use thanks to the biggest ever battery it has put inside a Note phone.

It will come in either 128GB or 512GB storage options as well as a slot for an additional memory card, meaning users of the latter could have up to one terabyte of space \u0026ndash more than many laptops.  The S Pen stylus that comes with the Note 9 has also been updated to now support Bluetooth, meaning it can be used remotely to run presentations or take photos just by clicking its top.  The camera itself has been improved too, with artificial intelligence added to recognise scenes and alter settings to take better pictures automatically, as well as alerting users to any blur spotted so they can quickly retake a photo.  The updates have meant a price increase, however, with the 128GB Note 9 costing \u0026pound899, while the 512GB device will cost \u0026pound1,099 when it goes on sale on August 24.  \u0026ndash Galaxy Watch  Samsung\u0026rsquos newest wearable has been given a battery life boost \u0026ndash now lasting up to seven days on a single charge, the firm claims \u0026ndash and will also support a standalone 4G connection meaning it can be used to get alerts independent of a smartphone.  The Watch also features new stress management tools, which can detect when a wearer is displaying high stress levels and suggest breathing and relaxation exercises in order to reduce those levels.  The device is capable of tracking sleep, and Samsung has added the ability for it to track 21 new types of indoor exercise.  A Bluetooth version of the Watch will be available from September 7 for \u0026pound329, while the 4G version will go on sale \u0026ldquolater this year, initially exclusively with EE.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Friday 10 Aug 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 4:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The introduction of a pilot project that will see key roads closed to traffic on the first Sunday of every month between 10am and 5pm was agreed at a meeting of the city council’s transport committee yesterday.            No decision has been taken on which roads will be closed during the Open Streets programme, but they will include “key parts of the city centre and town centres” across the Capital.            There will also be an eight-week public consultation to help determine people’s views on plans to further restrict vehicles in the city centre.After the meeting, vice transport and environment convener, Karen Doran, said: “There’s no doubt that for many years the city has been crying out for change - it definitely needs it.“It’s a massive change, but it’s about what the citizens want and what they need. I’m incredibly proud and impressed. It will future-proof our city for generations to come.”Daisy Narayanan, project director of Open Streets, said the monthly traffic closures would “help us understand what happens” when parts of the city are shut off to vehicles.She said: “All these ideas have to be tested for when we come back with a more concrete package.            “Where we are today is hugely exciting and we are ready to go to the public with some bold and realistic ideas. This is something that’s essentially a trial that could allow people to get used to what the city could be like. It will be a legacy for future generations.”However some Conservative councillors voiced concerns and urged that a “more cautious and data-driven approach” should be taken.Yesterday’s meeting considered a prospectus for the establishment of a Low Emmission Zone (LEZ) that outlined three visions for the future of transport in Edinburgh, including one radical option which would see the city centre becoming ‘largely traffic free’.Other elements of the prospectus set out plans for the pedestrianisation of key streets and areas such as Edinburgh’s town centres - Corstorphine, Gorgie and Dalry, Leith and Leith Walk, Morningside and Bruntsfield, Nicolson Street and Clerk Street, Portobello, Stockbridge and Tollcross.            Scotland’s first pollution-reducing LEZ will be operating in Glasgow at the end of the year when motorists will be fined for entering the protected area in proscribed vehicles.Yesterday Green councillor, Chas Booth, welcomed the radical proposals, but urged the council to adopt a “hybrid approach” to the LEZ plans, so that areas outside the city centre are also included.He was supported by Liberal Democrat councillor Gillian Gloyer who raised concerns that drivers could resort to “dumping polluting vehicles on the periphery of the city” to escape punshment.The Conservatives voted against moving forward the plans for regular Open Streets days, citing a lack of evidence of road closures to air pollution levels.Councillor Nick Cook called for a “high level of public confidence” in the plans and an “assurance that this is what the public and businesses want”.            He said: “We are in a situation where we are using anecdotal evidence. We are putting forward a full programme without enough data. We need a more cautious and data-driven approach.”The council will bring forward proposals later in the year for which routes could be closed for the Open Streets project and widespread consultation will be held with interested parties.The first open Streets events could take place early next year.Transport and environment convener, Lesley Macinnes, said: “I’m immensely pleased that the committee has come together and recognised the need to take this next step.“This report is an opportunity to really engage with the people of Edinburgh over the future of how this city runs and how this city serves them.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4781614.1533830953!/image/image.jpg","title":"full steam ahead for st andrews rail study","story":"        The campaign to re-open the St Andrews rail link after a 50-year gap today won Scottish Government funding for a study which could pave the way for the scheme.                Transport Secretary Michael Matheson further raised campaigners hopes by choosing the Fife town to announce £681,000 for research into the project and nine other potential rail initiatives across Scotland.            The appraisals will determine whether rail is the best transport development option, which could lead to government money to build them.            Research for the St Andrews Rail Link campaign (StARLink) in 2012 found that restoring the five-mile spur from Leuchars would cost £71 million.Its report said the line, closed in 1969, would cover its operating costs and provide faster journeys to and from Edinburgh than by road.Also awarded appraisal funding, with potential rail elements:East Lothian Council – new Haddington stationFife Council – Cross-Forth travel            Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership (Hitrans) – HM Naval Base Clyde transport opportunitiesLinlithgow and Linlithgow Bridge Community Council – Access to Linlithgow stationNorth East of Scotland Transport Partnership (Nestrans) – Accessibility at Insch stationNewburgh Train Station Group – new Newburgh station            StARLink – new St Andrews stationSouth Lanarkshire Council – connectivity in ClydesdaleTayside and Central Scotland Transport Partnership (Tactran) – Bridge of Earn/Oudenarde park and rideTactran – Stirling strategic park and rideThe new appraisals will be paid for by the £2m local rail development fund which was established  by ministers in February as part of the Scottish Budget deal with the Scottish Greens.            BACKGROUND: Campaigners renew push for St Andrews rail linkMr Matheson said: “Providing funding for these transport appraisals will allow the successful applicants to consider the transport issues and opportunities affecting their local communities.“Helping communities bring forward proposals to tackle these specific, local rail connectivity issues, will allow us to consider potential projects as part of our plans for future investment in our railways.”StARLink convenor Jane Ann Liston said: “As a prime national and international destination, being the \u0027home of golf\u0027 and Scotland\u0027s oldest university, the historic tourist destination of St Andrews has suffered for years from the onslaught of increasing traffic clogging up the town.“The StARLink campaign believes the option of direct rail travel from Edinburgh - including the airport interchange - and Dundee to the town would significantly alleviate both the physical and environmental effects of too many cars in a small town with a medieval layout.\"In addition, improving the connectivity with the likes of Cupar, Dundee and Dunfermline will spread the economic benefits generated by St Andrews over the whole of Fife and also across the Tay.”READ MORE: ‘Pop up’ railway stations could test passenger demand, say GreensScottish Greens environment spokesman and Mid Scotland and Fife MSP Mark Ruskell said: “Today’s announcement shows our Green budget win in action, helping communities across Scotland take the first step to getting back on the rail map after years of isolation.\"We listened to communities who had the vision and drive to re-open rail stations, but needed the support from government to build the case further. \"Re-opening rail stations takes time, but today’s announcement is the first step in a rail revolution that will lead to a positive legacy for generations to come.\"Expanding the rail network is vital if we are to deliver a green and clean transport system for the future, but it can also be a big driver to economically regenerate communities. “I’m delighted that both Newburgh and St Andrews rail campaigns have directly benefited from the fund.\"Both have developed compelling cases to reopen stations that would be a huge boost to their communities.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 10 Aug 2018 4:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

They want their elected representatives to engage in their public office duties with integrity and honesty. \n“What Ian Paisley did in accepting two lavish holidays to Sri Lanka and then lobbying on behalf of the Sri Lankan regime to thwart a UN investigation into serious human rights breaches and mass murder, isn\u0027t carrying out your duties with integrity.”\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f1.jpg","title":"65380  ","story":"    \nANTRIM boxer Conor Cooke believes he has the world in his hands after he left his first professional opponent sprawled at his feet following a spectacular second round KO.\nBut at 31 he knows he has to act fast.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"charity declines money raised at michael stone art exhibition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

institutions have proved fruitless, though Sinn Fein have claimed that a resolution was close in February 2018, before the DUP backed away from a proposed agreement, a claim the DUP deny. \n\nIt has been suggested that talks could be set to resume in October, but there has been disagreement among Northern Ireland\u0027s political parties over whether talks are supposed to take place.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster has called for Theresa May\u0027s Government to start taking decisions for Northern Ireland with little hope remaining of institutions in Northern Ireland being restored.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts east belfast roads remain closed after gas explosion","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

parties have been accused of using Belfast City Council resources for campaigning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nDUP councillor Lee Reynolds made the claim at the first meeting of the council’s Brexit committee on Thursday.\n\n\n \n\nTheresa May: EU must change ‘unworkable’ Brexit position\n \n\n\n\n \nCouncil\u0027s Brexit Committee could be \u0027squawking shop\u0027, councillor warns \n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe committee has been set up to look at what implications the UK leaving the European Union on March 29 2019 will have for Belfast.\n\nCommittee chair Seanna Walsh (Sinn Fein) opened the inaugural meeting by telling members that its terms of reference include reflecting on areas of impact Brexit may have on Belfast, including economic and funding.\n\nThe first order of business was a motion of support for the so-called backstop option.\n\nThe EU has proposed a backstop which would mean Northern Ireland remaining with the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.\n\nHowever the UK suggests a backstop would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020.\n\nThe motion at the council committee was proposed by Sinn Fein councillor Arder Carson, who described the backstop as an “insurance policy”.\n\n\n\nWhat we have is political parties using council resources for their political campaigning\nLee Reynolds, DUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nHe emphasised it should not be diluted, but rather extended.\n\nThe SDLP and Alliance Party backed the motion with minor amendments.\n\nSDLP councillor Donal Lyons told the committee the backstop was the “bare minimum”, describing it as a “safety net that we shouldn’t fall beneath”.\n\nBut unionist parties opposed the motion.\n\nDUP councillor Brian Kingston directed his comments to the Sinn Fein members, accusing them of “using the council”, because they are “boycotting” Westminster and the Assembly.\n\n“EU negotiators and the UK Government are not waiting for the verdict of Belfast City Council before making their next move,” he said.\n\n“Sinn Fein could have influence at Westminster which they boycott, or in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive … but there is a triple boycott going on.”\n\nMr Reynolds described the discussion as “just ridiculous”, arguing that the committee had been given a remit and claimed the proposed motion and discussion went beyond it.\n\n“What we have is political parties using council resources for their political campaigning,” he told the committee.\n\nSinn Fein councillor Ciaran Beattie hit back, saying his party runs for Westminster on an absentionist ticket, and claiming that the Assembly remains collapsed due to “DUP scandals” and the party “refusing rights”, including for Irish language speakers and equal marriage.\n\nThe motion was passed by 10 votes to 7, with Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance voting for, while the DUP, UUP and PUP voted against.\n\nLater in the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Jeffrey Dudgeon proposed that the committee review the role of Belfast’s Port Health Unit following the UK’s departure from the EU.\n\n“The Port Health Unit at Belfast Harbour Estate is currently approved to act on behalf of the EU as a Designated Point of Entry,” his proposal reads.\n\n“It also currently controls high-risk products of non-animal origin imported from outside the EU and is approved as a Border Inspection Post for the examination, sampling and clearance of third country imports of products of animal origin.\n\n“Given the changes after Brexit when the Unit may have to inspect direct imports from all the current EU states, as well as non-EU countries, the proposed review of its role and options will need to involve forward planning for various outcomes.”\n\nBelfast is the first council in Northern Ireland to have a dedicated committee to look at the potential impact of Brexit.\n\nCouncil officers have been tasked with assessing the impact that Brexit may have on its services, and are undertaking an audit of services to identify the nature and extent of potential impact on funding, personnel, procurement/contracts and legislation.\n\nThe committee is next due to meet on September 20.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018 belfast out on the roof summer","story":"\n Hi

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures hot air balloons light up for fiesta","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Still good, though.\n\n\n9. Kouyate Kid – @Ross_FPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Yui Mok/PA)\n\n\n\n\nA simple, topical pun. Cheikhou Kouyate moved from West Ham to Crystal Palace this summer, but will he kick on this season?\n\n\n8. Klopps and Robertson – @nikszo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Martin Rickett/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIn at eight, a nice play on words between Liverpool’s manager and his left-back Andrew Robertson. It’s cops and robbers, in case you didn’t get it.\n\n\n7. Giroud Sandstorm – @JoePaulBenton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\n\n\nRemember Sandstorm by Darude? Yeah, that.\n\n\n6. Bacuna Morata – @Ross_FPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Niall Carson/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAn update on the original Leandro Bacuna joke, this time with added Alvaro Morata!\n\n\n5. Sarri not Sarri – @kingsoflyon7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAnd keeping the Chelsea theme going, the Blues’ new manager Maurizio Sarri. No apologies necessary for that pun.\n\n\n4. Alisson Wonderland – @WorldOfOlly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Niall Carson/PA)\n\n\n\n\nSeamless from Liverpool’s new goalkeeper Alisson Becker, who was worth the massive transfer fee just for that pun.\n\n\n3. When Harry Met Salah – @FilipStray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Peter Byrne/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHarry Maguire, meet Mohamed Salah.\n\n\n2. Mee, my Delph and Ibe – @Linn_FPL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThree players you probably won’t see in the headlines much this season, despite the excellent punnage that they have provided here.\n\n\n1.

When they come out here you can just see the stress melting away from them.”\n\nEmploying donkeys for animal-assisted therapy is gaining popularity among groups dedicated to protecting them from mistreatment.\n\nThe Donkey Sanctuary, based in Devon, offers donkey-assisted therapy programmes for children recovering from cancer, victims of human trafficking and other vulnerable people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park was created by Steve Stiert, pictured (Mary Esch/AP)\n\n\n\n\n“We’re not providing therapy for the trauma but for developing life skills,” says Caron Whaley, therapy director at the Devon sanctuary.\n\nWhile donkeys are often portrayed in popular culture as gloomy or ill-tempered, they’re actually mild-mannered, intelligent and affectionate, donkey advocates say.\n\n“Some people come with the preconceived notion that they kick, they bite, they’re stubborn, they’re ornery,” Steve says. “None of those things are true at all.”\n\nSteve bought his first six donkeys from breeders but then started taking in rescues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe park provides free donkey-assisted therapy programmes and educational events (Mary Esch/AP)\n\n\n\n\nWhile he’s registered as a non-profit enterprise, Steve relies mostly on his own savings to care for the donkeys.\n\nHe doesn’t do birthday parties, nativity scenes or other money-making events, saying: “All our services are free. We don’t hire donkeys out.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured us baseball streaker from northern ireland reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Austins building in the city centre, the Derry News can reveal.\n\nThe department store, which has stood in the heart of Derry’s city centre for 188 years, closed over two years ago with the loss of 53 jobs.\n\nIt was opened by Thomas Austin in 1830 and remained in his family until the 1970s when it was bought by Derry businessman, Larry Hasson.\n\nIn November 2014 the store was placed into administrative receivership.\n\nThe receiver, the City Hotel Group, then sold the trading side of the business to Hassonzender Ltd and the store remained open until in March 2016.\n\nHowever, planning approval has now been issued by Derry City and Strabane District Council last week which will see the ‘refurbishment and restoration’ of the vacant listed building, with the new rear extension to the upper floors.\n\nThe work also includes the re-design of the shop front with ‘traditional materials and appearance’, while the offices on the fourth floor of the building will be changed to

Duddy said.\n\n“Unfortunately, there has been no movement with getting the building back into use.”\n\nMr Duddy also told the Derry News that there was no plans for the building to be used for
