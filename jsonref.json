There were racist, sexist and homophobic jokes and stereotype references.\u0027The script of the show was not seen or approved by anyone in authority at the university, nor by the Student Union.\u0027Police were called in to investigate but decided that no further action would be taken. Two students involved in the blacking up admitted a lack of sensitivity.Cardiff University says a \u0027wide range of support\u0027 was offered to students in the aftermath of the play.A spokesperson said: \u0027What the university does recognise is that it failed to forsee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students and that we were unable to influence or intervene in a manner that was able to prevent the very deep hurt caused by the breakdown in friendships and peer group relationships that we know impacted so heavily on some members of the complainant group.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

In the past week the top 10 films in cinemas in the UK and Ireland made just over £800,000 at the box office. Last year, an average week notched up £24m.With a schedule devoid of new Hollywood blockbusters, cinema operators have had to fall back on low-grossing classics and old hits, from Inception and The Empire Strikes Back to franchises including Twilight and Harry Potter.Earlier this month, cinema owners were dealt a blow when Disney pulled its new blockbuster Mulan from schedules, in favour of a release on the streaming service Disney+, leaving the Warner Bros’ Robert Pattinson-led Tenet as the great hope to reignite their year.“There is no getting away from it, it’s the first big commercial release,” said Crispin Lilly, chief executive of the boutique chain Everyman. “Tenet will be a very important step. This is the one that could get it all going. The uptake, the interest, the buzz is that it is going to do what we need it to do, which is re-kick cinema to the wider audience.”Tickets went on sale last week and Lilly said the rate of sales pegs Tenet at a box-office take similar to the Elton John biopic Rocketman or Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which took about £25m, or possibly even The Joker, which notched up £50m. “That would be superb,” Lilly said. “It is looking incredibly encouraging, it really is.”Tim Richards, the founder of Vue, one of the largest cinema operators in Europe, delayed reopening its 91 cinemas in the UK and Ireland until this month. Early ticket sales look strong, at levels matching Nolan’s Inception (£40m) to potentially as high Sam Mendes’s 1917 (£60m).“We have done a staggered opening over three weeks to make sure we are game ready when Tenet comes out,” said Richards. “Pre-bookings right now are really strong. With Warner Bros’ marketing and promotion muscle behind it, expectations are that it is going to do pretty close to pre-Covid levels of business.”Cinema owners, however, believe the distance rules will not have a big impact on ticket sales, because the pandemic has led to a step change in habits with the overwhelming dominance of weekend movie-going now at an end.“People are being cautious … many are now going on a Tuesday afternoon or a Wednesday evening instead of the traditional Friday and Saturday night,” said Richards. “Capacity restrictions are not such a big issue as we move to a true seven-day-a-week business.”However, one source cautioned that with the industry so badly needing Tenet to be a hit, the film may be in danger of being overhyped as it is unlikely to be to everyone’s tastes.“I think it will do well, but this is not Avengers we are talking about, and I am a little concerned that because it is the first big movie release it is being turned into something it is not,” said the source.If Tenet pulls in the crowds, and a second wave doesn’t result in a renewed shutdown, there are still plenty of box-office pounds to be salvaged this year.

The ONS said the July borrowing figures ranked as the fourth highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993.Since April, the beginning of the fiscal year, the UK has borrowed £150bn, an increase of £128bn on a year ago.Most of the increase can be attributed to the government’s rescue programmes to support the health service and fight the virus, while also making up for a plunge in tax revenues as companies and households hunkered down to ride out the pandemic.The ONS said: “The coronavirus pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances. These effects arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and iniduals.”The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent economic forecaster, said earlier this year that it expected the government to borrow £322bn this year.Over the past four months, the UK has borrowed almost as much it did in the 12 months after the financial crisis. The deficit surged to almost £160bn in the 2009-2010 financial year because of the cost of bailing out the banks and handling a deep recession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efaa35c16bb92edeb964da1bd7dc4fc3729b7e2/0_148_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef18b064f9aee399020f0636160412fd","title":"covid recovery in eurozone stalls dimming hopes of v shaped climb back","story":"August PMIs for services and manufacturing show retreat from July’s bouncebackThe eurozone’s recovery from its deepest economic downturn on record hit the brakes in August, as pent-up demand unleashed by the easing of coronavirus lockdowns dwindled, according to a closely watched survey.After many of the initial Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed, activity in the eurozone expanded in July at the fastest pace since mid-2018. But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year.

But most importantly, not once did he whine about shower pressure.“Throughout the convention, it was a common theme: Joe Biden’s history of loss and suffering,” the Late Show host said. “Surprisingly, we didn’t get a lot of jokes out of it, but there was a reason the convention hammered this point home: to cast Joe Biden in stark contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump couldn’t overcome any of the challenges of his presidency because he’s never had to overcome anything at all.”“This is the grownup version of the college essay that asks you to write about a challenge you’ve faced,” Colbert added, “and instead of scrambling to put together a story about bouncing back from getting second chair in your high-school a cappella group, Joe Biden has a real answer.”In his speech, Biden reflected on his own personal losses – his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46, his first wife Neilia and young daughter Naomi, who died in a car accident in 1972 – and carrying on through grief. “Your loved ones may have left this Earth, but they never leave your heart,” he said. “They will always be with you.”The vulnerable, empathetic speech showed Biden to be “a man who is decent, compassionate, flawed but honest – and that is water in the desert”, said Colbert. “He’s the sort of person who thinks before he says things, and when he gaffes, which he does often, it’s because his heart gets ahead of his words. He cares. And he tries his hardest.“He’s like a lot of people I know, and you do too. Which shouldn’t seem remarkable, but right now it is. And when Trump tweets his all-caps rebuke tomorrow morning, he’s just going to show how our president is not presidential. But Joe Biden is.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the third night of the Democratic convention, in which former president Barack Obama delivered a “brutal” speech that got “straight to the point”.For four years, Donald Trump has “shown no interest in putting in the work”, Obama said in his grave address, “no interest in finding common ground no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t.“Not even being mean about it – Obama was just laying out why President Trump has failed in a real and honest way,” Noah said. “I know he’s too classy for this, but I think Obama would make a great Yelper,” he added, imagining a “Barack O” Yelp review of a restaurant: “Vincenzo’s Quality Italian has no interest in making a great meatball sub. They won’t ever grow into your fave calzone joint because they can’t.”The speech “didn’t feel like the usual ‘things are gonna get better’ Obama speech”, Noah said. “It felt more like a funeral for democracy. Basically, four years of Trump took Obama from ‘yes we can’ to ‘let us pray’.”And on Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to shocking news that former Trump adviser and “human pimple” Steve Bannon was arrested on Thursday morning for allegedly skimming over $1m from “We Build the Wall”, an online fundraising campaign for the president’s proposed border wall with Mexico.It’s been a “brutal six months, so I’m gonna mainline some schadenfreude”, Meyers said of the news, which he called a “perfect encapsulation of the Trump era”.“From beginning to end, the wall was a non-stop scam,” Meyers continued. “Trump scammed his supporters by telling them Mexico would pay for it, then we ended up paying for it. Then this baked potato Fabio over here” – a sunburned Bannon – “said he’d pay for it, then he scammed everyone again by allegedly skimming money from it. It’s a Russian nesting doll of fraud.”Even funnier to Meyers was the fact that Bannon was arrested on a luxury yacht off the coast of Connecticut by federal officials and agents from the US Postal Inspection Service.“Think about how perfect this is: the same public agency Trump is currently trying to destroy, one of the most cherished public institutions in America, arrested his former campaign manager for allegedly skimming money from a fundraiser for their scam border wall,” said Meyers.And given that Bannon’s arrest occurred two days after a Senate intelligence report confirmed that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort shared sensitive campaign data with a Russian intelligence official, Meyers added, “it’s like the end of the summer TV season and they’re wrapping up all the story arcs at once”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Instead, computer modelling was used to assign grades. But when results were unveiled, there was shock and anger at what looked like clear injustices After all end-of-year exams were scrapped, students in England with offers of university places were awaiting their A-level results with more trepidation than usual. Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

(Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”The National aquarium has three webcams: Blacktip reef sharks, Jellies invasion and Pacific coral reef.Spot more than 50 species of fish in this 100ft tunnel.Choose from 10 live webcams and tune in at the listed times for narrated feedings.Explore.org is the largest live nature cam network, with 21 underwater streams.The Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach, CaliforniaBoasts round-the-clock surveillance of its penguin exhibit – above and below water."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51d29be806b9fc43904ecf9aa8b3453e6f57866/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8c01b4bac373cc70a1c76a017b244353","title":"greenland melting ice sheet in pictures","story":"New research has found Greenland lost more than a million tonnes of ice every minute in 2019, a trend which could result in a catastrophic sea level rise"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d291a14eb4cb04550b8355337b0d86ed3a84723d/100_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eef4c6a50e4e54bc4d2a4f0603abc1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos including rescued pangolins and hyacinth macaws"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a8d53e53c80331d8604dab89b741068307e6e0/0_64_2945_1766/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7352a7439bae8e303f50e3b83d360e5","title":"cbd cannabidiols are they the elusive hangover free drinks","story":"Cannabidiols (CBDs), the non-psychoactive element of cannabis, are legal and widely sold in drinks. Do they work, could they replace alcohol – and are they even drinkable? We test five candidates ...Walk past almost any chemist these days, and you’ll see a windowful of CBD-based products, and demand for the stuff is now so great – particularly over the last stressful few months – that it has migrated into drinks as disparate as as soft drinks, tea and gin. And it’s legal.CBD (short for cannabidiol) is the non-psychoactive component of cannabis, and is claimed to have significant health benefits, including pain relief and the reduction of stress and anxiety. The labelling often features words such as “calm”, “harmony” and “balance”, although some brand names, such as Trip and Colorado High, suggest something altogether more stimulating.So do CBD drinks contain enough to have a therapeutic effect? Possibly, if you drink more than one of them, or supplement them with a shot, drops or a cream. The Food Standards Agency recommends a maximum 70mg a day, but regular users I’ve spoken to consumed more like 100-200mg, which is quite impressive when many drinks contain as little as 10mg a serving. Like alcohol and caffeine, the effect can differ from one person to the next, and the only product that had a marked effect on me was Kannaswiss’s C3 shot (£35 for a pack of seven), which was packed with other ingredients and really did leave me feeling unusually sharp and focused.Taste is another issue. The basic taste of hemp is quite earthy and vegetal, which isn’t the biggest draw, so many new brands, such as Trip, Intune and Gibson’s Goodology, are understandably focusing on flavour. As you can see from today’s panel (below), these products don’t come cheap, even though CBD-based drinks are not currently taxed like alcoholic ones. And if one of the reasons you’re feeling stressed is financial, spending £10 a day on CBD drinks and shots isn’t going to work.That said, the demand is certainly out there. When Silent Pool put its Colorado High Gin online six weeks ago, it sold 800 bottles in two days, despite the £50 price tag, while Hatter’s became Holland \u0026amp Barrett’s fastest-selling tea earlier this year, shifting more than 25,000 boxes in the first month. Supermarkets have yet to come on board, but CBD drinks are already on sale in such respectable emporia as Fortnum \u0026amp Mason, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.The great commercial opportunity, of course, is that CBD drinks can be piggybacked on to the equally buoyant alcohol-free market. An adult soft drink that makes you feel good without giving you a hangover, and that’s the holy grail.Gibson’s Goodology Jasmine Tea and Rhubarb £4.95 a 250ml can, Hic! (or £14.85 for 3). Developed by one of London’s leading mixologists, Hide’s Oskar Kinberg, this tea-based drink has the highest level of CBD per serve (25mg a can), and also the best, most natural fruit flavours of any of the drinks I tried.

The hot favourites were kept waiting until the 80th minute for the single goal that sealed victory, Kheira Hamraoui finding the net from close range to finally see off a determined challenge from the patched-up underdogs.This should have been a mismatch. Barcelona won the Spanish league, have not lost a game since being beaten by Lyon in last season’s Champions League final, and have not been troubled by Atlético in three earlier meetings during this campaign. Their opponents found themselves severely compromised by Covid-19 – five players had to withdraw after testing positive – as well as injuries and player departures, yet Atlético showed all their determination and spirit in keeping the game tight for well over an hour.As expected, Barcelona played with an attacking front four, though not even the power of numbers could find a way through a solid Atléti defence. The numerical disparity was even more marked on the bench, where Barca named their full complement of 12 substitutes, while the hosts could only stretch to half a dozen. Atlético had considered forfeiting this game because they did not believe they would be able to raise a team, but even with a handful of debutants pressed into action they managed to give a good account of themselves.Barcelona had the best chance of breaking the first-half deadlock, when Asisat Oshoala chased down a half-cleared corner and Lieke Martens stabbed a shot goalwards, only to find Aïssatou Tounkara in position to clear off the line. The Spanish champions had the upper hand before the interval but were unable to convert their possession into clear-cut chances. Toni Duggan and Angelo Sosa, by contrast, were feeding off scraps playing up front for Atlético, yet in addition to frustrating the Barcelona attack the underdogs did create a couple of opportunities, with Kylie Strom narrowly failing to convert a difficult chance that reached her at the far post, and Sosa shooting too high with teammates waiting for a cross.Oshoala managed to escape Tounkara to reach a couple of crosses early in the second half, without managing to get any power or direction into her headers. More worrying for Barca was what happened when Oshoala finally got in behind Tounkara with the ball at her feet. While Hedvig Lindahl was quickly off her line it was still a chance the Nigerian striker would normally bury, yet she snatched at the shot and put the ball wide of the target. Caroline Hansen did no better with Barcelona’s next chance, hammering a shot at Lindahl with Oshoala an unused option in the middle. As the game entered the final quarter of normal time Barcelona looked the more likely to score but their finishing was still indecisive.The winning goal, when it came, was a tad scruffy, but Barcelona were not complaining. In what turned out to be her last action of the game, Oshoala showed her frustration by attempting an overhead kick near the penalty spot when Hansen crossed from the right. She was unable to make a clean connection, though she did succeed in sending the ball towards Hamraoui, who just needed to keep her composure to slide a low shot into the bottom-left corner. The same player could have added a second before the end – this time Lindahl was equal to her effort – though a two-goal margin would have flattered Barceona and been unnecessarily cruel on the losers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebd05fce2af8a4547f0991d9706632dde9d1b5ea/0_63_1705_1023/master/1705.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e5b08030f69b0c767dfd1e176d1f5c","title":"glasgow city wolfsburg womens champions league quarter final match report","story":"They had been playing for an hour and the rain had at last stopped hammering on the roof of this vast, empty arena, the sun starting to come out at last, when Lauren Wade bent a beautiful curling shot over Frederieke Abt an into the net. There was a shout from somewhere in the stand and, the White Stripes playing for her this time, Wade clenched her fist and broke into a broad smile. Teammates in orange run over and embraced her, some sense of vindication perhaps, however short-lived.No, Glasgow didn’t lead and, no, they weren’t going through, but no one had expected them to do either of those things – and at least they had left some mark. Ultimately, though, Wolfsburg left a far greater mark on them and may leave a lasting mark on this competition. So impressive here, the German champions took their opponents apart, piece by piece from start to finish and are candidates for sure, a side with so much quality and confidence, quick and clever players seemingly in every position. Svenja Huth and Pernille Harder, in particular.Glasgow had already let in five by the time they scored and they would let in a further four, the gulf between these two clubs gigantic. But then, they knew that: the odds on a Wolfsburg victory were 66-1 on and Glasgow’s founder had said it makes her “giggle” to see the teams they were up against. Here was a moment to smile, at least, something to take home from an evening that was mostly chastening, reality allowing little room for romance.The only part-time team in the competition were destroyed. With seven minutes to go, Glasgow took off their goalkeeper Lee Alexander. She had saved three penalties to bring them here. Now, though, she had let in eight. Erin Clacher replaced her and almost immediately saw Harder smash a shot against her bar. Then she too let one in in the last minute, a cruel own goal looping over her head off Leanne Ross .That was one of two own goals. There were also four goals from the superb Harder, two from Ingrid Engen and one from Felicitas Rauch. The doubt had always been not so much if Wolfsburg would score as when, and how often. The answer to the first question was fifteen minutes – although it did come after a neat slotted pass from Krystyna Freda might have given Glasgow an opportunity to open the scoring. The answer to the second was nine.Harder got the first of them, which was not much a surprise either, a shot from the edge of the area giving her a thirty-fifth goal this season and she wasn’t about to stop there. Seven Nation Army blared out, as it always does, and Wolfsburg had begun. Three minutes later it was two, Engen heading in a corner well inside the six yard box. There were a lot of Glasgow players there, but none had taken hold of the Norwegian.There were a lot of Glasgow players in their own area a lot of the time, in fact. The Germans turned the screw, offering no way out. The ball was theirs and theirs alone, used smartly, comfort in everything they did, even if the pace the goals went in didn’t really quicken. A gorgeous nutmeg from Ewa Pajor soon after somehow didn’t get the finish it deserved, Zaneta Wyne seeing her escape only for the finish to evade the far post. This was becoming a recurring theme for the full-back, unfortunate that so much of what Wolfsburg did was building on her side.It wasn’t until the 37th minute that Glasgow produced their first shot and that, a long looping effort from Wade going well wide. By then, their opponents had taken thirteen of them .They hadn’t yet added a third goal, though. When they did, on 44 minutes, it again came from the right. Another slick move picked its way through the orange and concluded with Huth’s beautiful ball bent into the path of Engen to finish from close range.There was time for another before the break, Harder smashing in a shot from outside the area. Ten minutes after the restart she had her eighth hat-trick of the season. Another Huth cross, another header, and it was five-nil. Glasgow got theirs, but still Wolfsburg came. Again, and again and again. Four minutes later Rauch made it 6-1, Harder got the seventh from another superb delivery by Huth and then two cruel own goals followed, but at least Glasgow had got one at the other end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df5adbfe98e31582ec00ae4719c91bc7c9e31122/0_117_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=298dc63e34de16483b39dfa55632e24f","title":"best thing do to make the world a better place nothing","story":"Don’t be fooled into overachieving – it’s often more valuable to simply not screw things up‘Lots of people are feeling unproductive,” the doctor and journalist James Hamblin observed last month. “But if you successfully infect zero people with the virus, seriously, you’ve been extremely productive.”It has been a strange truth about the pandemic that for most of us, most of the time, the single most important thing we’ve been called upon to do, for our own benefit and that of others, has been not to do things: stay home, avoid crowds, go shopping as infrequently as possible, refrain from coughing or sneezing on people, and so on. For a civilisation fixated on getting stuff done, this was never going to be easy. The energy of the global anti-racism protests has been attributed, in part, to people feeling cooped up in lockdown. But maybe a better way to put that is that finally, after months of compulsory nothing, there was something tangible to be done.The more I thought about Hamblin’s underlying point, though – that not doing things can sometimes be worth feeling good about – the more I wondered why it only applied to not spreading germs. After all, don’t I refrain from doing a theoretically infinite number of things every day, and by so (not) doing, make the world better than otherwise? We’re familiar with this idea of abstention as a virtue in certain specific contexts: in the medical vow to “do no harm”, for example or frugality as abstention from unnecessary spending or sobriety as abstention from alcohol. But what about all the times I don’t snap at my partner or son, or the Twitter feuds I don’t get embroiled in? What about all the meat I don’t eat, despite not being vegetarian, or the greenhouse gas emissions I don’t cause? And put aside, for a moment, all those times I succumb to digital distraction when I ought to be working what about all the times I don’t succumb?If this strikes you as a suspiciously simple intellectual trick that probably won’t eliminate everyone’s stress and anxiety for ever, well, I’d have to agree. Obviously, there are countless things I don’t do for which I don’t deserve praise: not murdering people, not vandalising storefronts, not defrauding animal welfare charities in order to buy sports cars and cocaine, the list goes on. Besides, plenty of the stress we feel about getting things done is because we genuinely do need to get them done, simply to stay financially afloat.Even so, I think there’s a liberating insight here for all of us who go through life with the background conviction that our moral worth is defined by our accomplishments, that we must earn our right to exist by achieving some minimum standard of performance at work, as parents, or in some other realm, and that we’re fundamentally bad people if we don’t. Ideally, we’d just drop that whole notion and be at peace with ourselves, whatever our performance.

Like democracy proper, this means we often end up on a day out that the majority of the car are not in favour of. You might consider our day trip to Legoland a metaphor for the government’s dealings with NHS staff, in that, unbelievably, you also have to pay for parking.My wife and I have been looking for things that unify opinion in the run-up to the “Where are we going for our day out?” elections. We have been surprised to discover that one of the biggest drivers in where we decide to go is whether or not the attraction has crazy golf or mini golf. Crazy golf is much better than mini golf, but many places are now calling themselves crazy golf, without showing the slightest hint of lunacy. After many disappointing visits to what is in fact a very boring mini-golf course with some toy dinosaurs duct-taped to it, I am a strong advocate for regulation in this area.Anyway, it turns out we are addicted to crazy golf, despite some empirical evidence suggesting that we hate it. It always starts very well, with the selection of clubs and coloured balls, and who is going to keep score. We have even come up with a hard and fast order of play, going up by age. The kids think they are getting the better end of the deal in this, but it allows me to have observed exactly how the ball bounces off the diplodocus four times before I have to step up. The kids have also often moved on to the next hole by then, so my scores are whatever I want them to be, based on who in the family needs to be taken down a peg or two.The first couple of holes are always great. We all take turns, compliment each other’s stroke play, and move on to the next hole commenting on how wonderful family time is. By the third or fourth, somebody may be struggling to hole their ball, and frustration is starting to creep in, perhaps to the level where I might throw in a “We’re having a nice time here, guys, let’s not ruin it,” like a desperate supply teacher.By the sixth hole, things have usually fallen apart. One of the kids has thrown his ball across the course in frustration we have given up on keeping scores because it’s causing arguments and my wife and I have snapped at a family playing behind us for making sarcastic comments about how long we’re taking. We move around the rest of the course simply trying to get through this as quickly as possible, while creating some space between us and them.It is about then that an elephant’s scrotum will prove particularly tricky to get a golf ball past, and one of the kids will try and fail to break his club over his knee, which makes us laugh, enraging him further, to the point of smashing the club repeatedly into the ground just as we are caught up by our tormentors. My wife or I will then take him out of the game, and the remaining members of the family will force themselves through the rest of the course, as if there is some law against just admitting this was a terrible idea and leaving immediately.The truth is, golf is never really that crazy, or much fun. They need to rename it “rage golf”. And I think the family are slowly beginning to realise that we might not actually enjoy it as much as we think we do. We haven’t reached full epiphany yet, though, and tomorrow we will go to Pirate Adventure golf in Weymouth. Apologies in advance to any families behind us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cde4a34354a145ad045d6e4b28c8992343cfda5/1_0_1999_1200/master/1999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ced5dd40f820119d5e173c194bab368","title":"my sister doesnt want to see me should i give up","story":"Your mother caused this rift, says Annalisa Barbieri. But if your sister really doesn’t want to be in contact, you should listenMy childhood was not a happy one. My mother was a narcissistic and toxic person who liked everyone but my older sister, my father and me. She was beautiful, smart and the life of the party. Everyone adored her. But, at home, my sister and I parented her. My father didn’t orce her because of us (the subject was raised several times and we begged for it not to happen). He was 52 when I was born and died when I was 20 I’ve missed him ever since.My mother died a couple of years ago, aged almost 100. I was the only one taking care of her, emotionally and financially, for the last 11 years of her life. She was difficult till the end. After years of therapy, I came to terms with the way she behaved (I’ve forgiven her, but not forgotten), and was there when she passed away, giving her comfort. I am happy that she didn’t break me the way she did my sister.I am happily married with children, and have given them what I never had as a child: namely, love. My sister lived with my mother for more than 30 years she has never married and doesn’t have children. When I returned to Europe after 30 years abroad, she announced that I had to be responsible for our mother. That was the last time I saw her. She says she doesn’t want to see me again because I remind her of our mother. Therapy helped me realise that my sister bore the brunt of my mother’s behaviour. I feel a lot of love for my sister, and was devastated by her rejection, but hoped that, after the death of our mother (who loved to see us apart), we would reunite. It hasn’t happened and now I know it never will. I have written to her several times, to no avail. Should I give up?I wonder if your sister felt rejected, or even abandoned, by you when you went abroad. I don’t know the circumstances – maybe your sister wanted to stay with your mum or maybe she felt she had no choice. But moving continent was quite a statement to make, although I can see why you did it.What happened in those intervening 30 years? Did you visit? Did you stay in touch with your sister? When did you realise your sister had been “broken” by your mum? It seems to me that you’ve done some work (therapy) and realised a few things, and a part of you seems to think your sister should be on the same page. Unfortunately, she doesn’t seem to be.Family therapist and sibling specialist Sharon Bond also wanted you to think about what “giving up” means to you. What would it look like, and how would you do it?Many people write to me wanting to sever ties with family members (or to stop trying to re-establish contact, as in your case). But it’s rarely that simple, because situations and feelings change in ways that you can’t predict. So breaking contact isn’t usually as finite as people would wish. “How would your sister know you’re giving up?” Bond asked. And I would also ask: is it important to you that she knows?As you seem to align yourself with your father, Bond also wondered if you feel that he didn’t “give up” on his marriage, and if that means you in turn can’t give up on your sister. Perhaps you need to turn it around and ask: why hang on? I wonder if you feel you need to make a big statement (even if it’s just to yourself) in the hope of cleaning up a messy situation. But again I wonder if this would give you what you really want.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

But some landlords described it as “unacceptable” and said they were being left “to foot the bill for government failure”.Renters have been protected during the Covid-19 crisis by a temporary government ban on landlords evicting tenants, announced in March and extended in June. It was due to end on Sunday and courts would have restarted eviction hearings from Monday.The lord chancellor requested the extension of the ban on Thursday and it was approved by the civil procedure rule committee on Friday morning in a meeting that noted the “extremely unusual nature and timing” of the government decision.Landlords in England will also be required to provide tenants with six months’ notice, rather than three currently, until at least the end of March, unless the case involves a serious issue, such as antisocial behaviour or domestic violence. When cases do resume, courts will prioritise the most serious cases involving antisocial behaviour and other crimes, and those where rent has gone unpaid for more than a year and landlords would otherwise face unmanageable debts.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “I know this year has been challenging and all of us are still living with the effects of Covid-19. That is why today I am announcing a further four-week ban on evictions, meaning no renters will have been evicted for six months. I am also increasing protections for renters: six-month notice periods must be given to tenants, supporting renters over winter.”As states across the world ordered citizens to “stay home” in February, the UN housing rapporteur was unequivocal. “Housing has become a frontline defence against coronavirus,”\u0026nbspsaid Leilani Farha. She called on states to “declare an end to all evictions of anyone, anywhere for any reason until the end of the pandemic.”Four months later, and as parts of the world emerge into the so-called new normal, her successor, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, is\u0026nbspwarning\u0026nbspof an “impending tsunami” of evictions. In the US, a\u0026nbspmajority of states have resumed evictions, leaving as many as 40 million – disproportionately people of colour – vulnerable to homelessness due to rent arrears.Bailiffs are back in business across the channel, too, after\u0026nbspan extension to France’s winter eviction ban\u0026nbspexpired last month. In Paris, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has protected social renters by extending the eviction ban on public housing to 31 October – protecting them until next summer by segueing into next winter’s\u0026nbsptrêve hivernale.Some countries are doing more. In Spain, where the leftwing Podemost party are part of a governing coalition,\u0026nbspthe government has introduced an eviction ban\u0026nbspthat will remain in force until six months after the end of the state of emergency. An interest-free micro-loan scheme is open to renters who have lost income due to the pandemic.Strong protections are also in place in Germany, where renting is widespread and\u0026nbsprenters’ unions are well-established and powerful. In March the federal government banned the eviction of tenants who fall behind in rent between April and the end of September, while giving itself the discretion to extend the measure for another six months. Landlords can still take tenants to court to recover lost rent.For millions, though, the situation remains bleak and uncertain. Thousands in poorer countries such as Kenya and Brazil were being thrown out of their homes even as the pandemic raged, Rajagopal reported. He warned that when people are deprived of shelter, they become more vulnerable to COVID-19 “and this heightens the risk of widespread contagion.”“I call upon all States to comply with their human rights obligations and ensure that no one is left in a position of increased vulnerability to Covid-19,” he said.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the “11th-hour U-turn” was necessary. But he described the extension as so brief it “will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags”.“Boris Johnson has been warned for months about the looming evictions crisis, but stuck his head in the sand,” Starmer said. “People living in rented accommodation should not be paying the price for this government’s incompetence.”The move was described by the London Renters Union as “kicking the can down the road”.“We’ve had a series of short-term extensions, and that’s caused enormous misery and stress for renters like me,” said Ghazal Haqani, an organiser with the union. “Because so many of us are in arrears, we have been constantly worried for months that we are about to become totally defenceless against landlords who want to kick us out of our homes. It looks like that could happen all over again in September.”The terms under which the ban will eventually be lifted remain unclear. One source said civil servants and ministers had been considering whether protections could remain in place for people who can show they have fallen behind on their rent because of coronavirus. District councils have said up to half a million people could be at risk, while the housing charity Shelter said by the end of June about 174,000 renters had been warned by their landlords that they were facing eviction. Shelter estimated a quarter of a million renters were in arrears.Doctors, represented by the British Medical Association, also warned of a potential surge in Covid-19 cases if the ban was not extended and homelessness increased, with homeless people more likely to have health conditions that increase their vulnerability.The National Residential Landlords Association attacked the government’s decision.“Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates,” said Ben Beadle, the chief executive. “There must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income.”But Alicia Kennedy, the director of the campaign group Generation Rent, said the move was a relief to worried renters, although leaving it so close to the deadline had put people through “untold mental stress”.Generation Rent wants the government to use the coming weeks to develop emergency legislation to restrict the use of section 21 “no fault” evictions, as well as eviction for rent arrears, ready for introduction after parliament returns from summer recess on 1 September.Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “A bullet may have been dodged with this extension, but as soon as parliament returns, it must give judges extra powers to stop renters being evicted because of ‘Covid-arrears’.”Two of England’s biggest private landlords told the  they did not plan mass evictions. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of homes in and around Ashford in Kent, said he was expecting his agents to issue two eviction notices. “One is a poorly organised man and the other downright dishonest,” Wilson said.Andrew Panayi, who runs a business renting out several hundred flats and houses in north London, said: “No eviction notices will be served in the foreseeable future.”The National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords and housing associations, had also said no one would be evicted as a result of financial hardship caused by the coronavirus as long as residents made contact with their landlord to agree a manageable way forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

So it’s frozen.”The downbeat assessments came after two days of talks in Brussels and a private dinner between Barnier and Frost. On Thursday, Frost gave Barnier a fresh draft free-trade agreement in an attempt to break the deadlock. Known as a “consolidated legal text” the document merges existing EU and UK draft texts, in an attempt to speed up an autumn agreement.The British official said they had not expected the text to be discussed this week, but hoped “to inject a spark” in the process. “Really, it’s to make the point that we have been saying that it’s time to move to text-based discussions,” they added.Barnier said the document had been “useful” to understand the UK position, but added that it failed to understand the EU’s red lines on the “level-playing field”, common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid to give Britain tariff-free access to the EU single market.Sticking to the EU’s well-established position, Barnier rejected any attempt to fast-forward trade negotiations, ahead of other parts of the talks, such as fishing rights and British hauliers’ rights to deliver goods in the EU.Barnier’s insistence on “parallelism” has long frustrated the British. The EU’s approach “makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress”, said Frost.Frost, who said last week a deal could be reached in September, added there were “significant areas” to resolve. “Even where there is a broad understanding between negotiators, there is a lot of detail to work through. Time is short for both sides.”The EU has said there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing, as it insists European boats maintain access to British waters. On the subject, Barnier said: “We have made no progress whatsoever on the issues that matter.”British negotiators share this view, but accuse the EU of failing to understand that the government wants a major change from the status quo. EU member states, which claim centuries-old fishing rights in British waters, want to maintain current access, although Barnier has hinted he is open to compromise.Similarly, the UK negotiators are frustrated by the EU’s wish to bind Britain tightly to European rules on state aid in exchange for a free-trade deal. The EU fears generous subsidies to UK companies could tilt the playing field against EU firms.“Things are focussing down, not necessarily helpfully, on the issues of state aid, subsidy policy and fisheries policy,” said the UK official. “What’s frustrating here is that Michel Barnier said in his press conference just now, ‘Brexit means Brexit’, which is of course correct. They don’t apply that in this area where they want to see us continuing arrangements that are very like those that we’re bound by as members of the EU,” they added.“When the EU realise that that needs to change it will be much easier to make progress.”The two sides also failed to make progress this week on long-standing disagreement over lorry drivers’ rights after Brexit. Barnier expressed surprise about the UK debate about the loss of haulage rights after Brexit, while stressing that any future access would depend on accepting EU standards on hauliers’ working time and other regulations. Citing recent press reports, he said: “We have seen an emotion that surprised me four years after the Brexit vote … the UK has decided itself to lose the benefits of the single market. It was their choice. It was not our choice.”The talks are scheduled to resume on 7 September in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe8e62f4e7da27d243e09993b65f47120c948205/0_187_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b3a658e91ca5f2b6c71a4a6f72775931","title":"uk families bereaved by covid 19 lose eligibility for welfare benefits","story":"The families of low-paid frontline NHS and social care workers who die from coronavirus will be stripped of eligibility for welfare benefits if they receive a payout under the government’s Covid-19 compensation scheme, it has emerged.Under the NHS and Social Care Coronavirus Life Assurance Scheme, the £60,000 lump sum breaches capital limits rules for most benefits, meaning that the recipient would unable to claim universal credit, housing benefit or pension credit.Labour has called for families who successfully apply for the payout to be exempted from capital limits rules, in line with other compensation schemes, such as those set up for victims of the Windrush scandal and the Grenfell Tower fire.At least 540 frontline health and social care workers are estimated to have died from coronavirus in England and Wales alone since the beginning of the pandemic, including doctors, nurses, porters, care home workers and paramedics.Jonathan Reynolds, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “Health and social care workers are putting their lives on the line to care for coronavirus patients, often without the proper equipment, and many have sadly lost their lives as a result.“The government was right to say we must honour those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. So it is shocking that families are being forced to choose between accessing social security they are entitled to or the compensation they need.”The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) called for “urgent clarification” saying that the payments “should not impact grieving recipients’ eligibility for welfare and other benefits”.The RCN said: “The loss of nursing staff due to Covid-19 is tragic. Each one was a huge loss to our profession, to their communities and most of all to their loved ones. The government must address this issue immediately.”Unison’s general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: “Taking away the income of families in need makes no sense. These payments are meant to provide financial security when it’s needed most, not be an excuse to make savings elsewhere. Ministers must fix this to ensure the loved ones of health and care workers who lost their lives are provided for properly.”Under universal credit rules, anyone with capital or savings of over £16,000, not including the value of their main home, is ineligible to claim support. Claimants with savings of over £6,000 face tapered deductions from their benefit payments at a rate of £4.35 a month for every £250 over the lower limit.A House of Commons library note says: “The DWP has agreed with HM Treasury and the Department for Health and Social Care that these payments will not be disregarded. Therefore, if a recipient of a payment from this … scheme is on one of these benefits, it will fully be taken into account as capital.”The scheme, which opened on 20 May, was announced in April by health secretary Matt Hancock amid increasing concerns over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) available to frontline health and care workers.At the time Hancock said he felt “a deep personal sense of duty” that the government must care for the loved ones of NHS and care staff who lost their lives.There is already concern over the few numbers of applications so far to the UK-wide scheme, which opened on 20 May. The latest figures, from 8 July, show just 51 claims for the bereavement scheme had been received. None had been rejected at that point, with 32 then still under consideration. Capital limits rules have caught out a number of recent applicants for universal credit, including couples who had been saving for a mortgage who found they were ineligible for benefit support after losing their job as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Labour has previously called for capital limits to be lifted during the pandemic.A government spokesperson said: “The death of any healthcare worker is a tragedy. Since it began in May, the life assurance scheme has already provided additional financial security to families of frontline NHS and social care workers in England who have died due to coronavirus.“It has always been one the central principles of Universal Credit that decisions on awarding the benefit should take into account iniduals’ existing ability to meet their basic needs, so that we maintain our focus on supporting families in most need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cc8b88e699ce228551a8494f9ef2ddb4998b508/0_461_4377_2628/master/4377.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=43d5ea30d5505d60a721f09ba3ff9130","title":"england pakistan third test day one match report","story":"Zak Crawley’s maiden Test century came with the minimum of fuss. He had taken tea on 97 on the resumption he took guard against that tormentor of nervous batsmen, Mohammad Abbas he clipped a two to square leg then to the last delivery of the over there was a little shimmy down the pitch and a firm push between the cover fielders for two more.Jos Buttler, still wearing his gloves, shook his hand and the landmark that tantalises every young professional batsman had been achieved. It had been such an uncomplicated process yet this was only the fourth first-class century in this ultra-calm 22-year-old’s career.Crawley’s unbeaten 171 may be the most important innings of the summer in terms of the evolution of the England team. Certainly it has allowed England to dominate the match. They were wobbling on 127 for four whereupon Crawley joined forces with Buttler and batting seemed easier than at any time this summer. They combined to score 205 runs together in an unbroken partnership that transformed the scoreboard and transfixed the eye. There are no unsightly tics when these two are together.Crawley came to the crease in the fifth over of the day after Joe Root had won a good toss the pitch was drier than its predecessor and the wind was gusting, which makes life more difficult for bowlers than batsmen. Rory Burns had just been dismissed by Shaheen Afridi for the third time in an unproductive series for the left-hander – he seems to prefer batting against West Indies bowlers. Crawley’s first delivery was a little too full and a little too leg side and he clipped it with absolute certainty to the square-leg boundary.So from the very start Crawley looked to score rather than survive. That is his natural disposition and the beauty of his elevation to Test level has been his determination to stay that way. He is a natural strokemaker and he continues to give himself the freedom to play his shots it looks so simple when it works. Grafting is for Burns and Dom Sibley.Crawley’s outlook was highlighted by his response to the early introduction of Yasir Shah. With the breeze so strong and unpredictable it was always going to be tough for Yasir, and Crawley seemed to sense that. He was quick to seize on any blemish in length and Yasir’s first four overs cost 21 runs. Even Sibley was keen to be proactive against the wrist spinner he also advanced down the wicket to punch the ball on the leg side. However this was not such a natural approach for Sibley to adopt and he was correctly given lbw – even though a fair distance down the pitch – by umpire Michael Gough, whose qualities as an umpire have been enhanced in the eyes of an English audience this summer.Shah was bolstered by this wicket and the run rate slowed. Several times he beat the edge of Root’s bat as the England captain seemed set on cutting good-length balls. Either side of the interval even Crawley was prepared to contemplate some discretion but there was still time to hit the last ball of the session for four to complete his half-century.After the break he lost Root to a superb delivery from Naseem Shah that was edged to the wicketkeeper. Root paused on his way back to the pavilion to have a look at the replay on the screen. He raised his eyebrows and offered a wry smile, which suggested he was as content as a dismissed batsman can be. There was not much he could have done with that delivery.This conclusion could not be reached after Ollie Pope’s dismissal. He was deceived by Yasir in the same way as in his last Test innings. Pope was stuck on the crease he misjudged the length of an anticipated leg-break which turned out to be a straight ball that fizzed off the pitch before clattering into his stumps. The batting coach, Jonathan Trott, may not be quoting Oscar Wilde at him just yet since this is a sympathetic regime.Life soon became trickier for Naseem. His first ball to Buttler was clipped for four while Crawley was now in the groove, gracefully dispatching anything off target. Naseem tried the odd short delivery against him but this pitch has no great pace and Crawley unveiled a couple of perfectly timed pull shots in between willowy, effortless drives.After a smooth, bright start Buttler was content to sit back and admire his partner. On 20 Pakistan tried a review against him when he was leaving a ball from Shaheen Afridi, which only served to highlight how they fear what Buttler can do his bat was nowhere near the ball. Later there was a reminder why they should think like that when he helped himself to two effortless straight sixes against Shah. But Crawley remained the senior partner, impishly reverse sweeping the leg-spinner immediately when he tried bowling around the wicket. The new ball did not bother him much either as 148 runs flowed in the final session. If Ben Stokes returns to the Test team as a batsman only, Crawley will no longer be the man to give way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ca9e66093830154601f88f23d9a1bfc9207358/40_184_5073_3045/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb235616b986da4415e095d132b1ba5e","title":"england v pakistan third test day one live","story":"Zak Crawley scored a stunning 171 not out, his maiden Test hundred, and Jos Buttler added a majestic unbeaten 87 to put England on topOn that happy note - and it really was the most charming interview - I’ll say goodnight. Bye!“I feel comfortable batting outside my crease to Mohammad Abbas. I try and work on it in the nets, especially walking at him. I feel like I can take LBW and bowled out of the game if I do that. He can still nick me off he’s a fine bowler and he beat the bat plenty today. Mohammad Rizwan came up to the stumps a couple of times but I thought he’d do it more often. I was surprised because I was definitely harder when I was in the crease.”“I had inidual plans for each bowler. Luckily I got a few balls to hit – it might have seemed like I had a bit of intent but it was just the way the balls fell. Yasir was challenging because he gets quite low bounce and he bowls this ball that does you – you think it’s short and it’s not. I had a much clearer game plan against him after the second Test so that innings was definitely beneficial.“The toughest thing was trying to keep a hundred out of my head! When I was on about 25 I felt in decent touch and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Luckily when I got to about 70 I calmed down a bit.”“It was an unbelievable feeling to reach a hundred. My whole career so far almost flashed before my eyes. Hopefully I can get a few more. I got to about 91 and I was very nervous – Jos didn’t think I was so I must have hidden it well.” That’s it for today’s blog. Thanks for your company, emails and Shakespeare corrections I’ll leave you with Vic’s match report. And if you have Sky Sports, don’t forget to watch Adam on the Debate at 7.15pm. Goodnight!A word, too, for Jos Buttler, who batted like a lord to make 87 not out. This summer he has unwittingly become a isive figure now we can move on to arguing over some other poor bloke.The England balcony are all on their feet to applaud Crawley, their smiles full of the kind of warmth you can’t fake. Eight hours ago he was a stand-in for Ben Stokes now, after a wonderful 171 not out, he is England’s No3 for the forseeable future. His innings was so classy and accomplished that it’s almost hard to believe he’s a 22-year-old making his first Test hundred. Spoiler: it’s not his last. 90th over: England 332-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 87) Buttler times Naseem through point for four to bring up a seriously good 200 partnership with Crawley. There aren’t many crap 200 partnerships, I realise, but this one has been brimming with skill, intelligence, authority and purpose. Even in the last over of the day, Buttler is looking for runs - he follows that boundary with a clip through midwicket for three more. I don’t think Buttler has ever played better than this in Test cricket. Zak Crawley certainly hasn’t.89th over: England 325-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 80) Mohammad Abbas beats Crawley with a fantastic legcutter, bowled from wider on the crease. Crawley smiles, as he has for most of the day. 88th over: England 322-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 77) Naseem continues to Crawley, who will sleep well tonight whatever happens in the next 15 minutes. He drives crisply back at Naseem, who collects the ball on the bounces and shapes as if to throw at the stumps. Good lad.87th over: England 322-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 77) Mohammad Abbas changes ends to replace Afridi, who bowled three shoddy overs with the second new ball. Buttler edges a good delivery short of first slip and is then beaten by another delicious straightener. Okay, a delivery that straightens from leg to off. Either way, it was quite brilliant bowling.“In the current climate in which everyone’s having a shocker of a summer, I feel duty bound to put a word in to defend Burns,” says Harry Lang. “I know journos need something to write and kicking players when they have a poor run is as common in Fleet Street as phone-hacking and an 11am sharpener, but I wish they’d hold back on lambasting the team, younger players especially.“Opening in a Test is a confidence game to a great extent, so column inches suggesting his potential replacements (as seems to happen to every English batsman that goes through a slow patch e.g. the one-man whacking machine that is Jos Buttler) seems a little cruel. Imagine if we, the readers, reviewed journalist performance with the same bloodthirsty vigour? The sports pages would be written by algorithms and bots by the end of the year...” Well, that sort of happens with BTL comments, which is why so many sports writers are nowhere near as goodconfident as they were a decade ago (I include myself in this I’m not just flinging bitter Friday evening haymakers at my superiors). You’d think this would make writers less inclined to put the boot in, though if anything it has made it more common.86th over: England 322-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 77) Crawley has scored 74 from 88 balls since tea, yet he has barely played a risky stroke. He has an impressive ability to change his tempo depending on the bowling and match situation. He has one new challenge to deal with because Naseem Shah is back in the attack. He starts with a probing maiden to Crawley, who defends when necessary and leaves everything else. It’s already digital chip paper, but that was a really good over.“Now Rob,” says Phil Sawyer, “you know what happens when you start talking about Daddy Don’t make us call the emergency services. Again.”You won’t be surprised to hear I got a rare old brollocking for that. On reflection, they might have had a point.85th over: England 322-4 (Crawley 171, Buttler 77) Afridi’s immature new-ball spell continues with an errant delivery to Buttler that zips away for four leg-byes. Then Buttler drags a drive past mid-off for four more. I’m so chuffed for Buttler, who had been through all sorts this summer and is now batting like the genius he is. It might not last, I wouldn’t put money on it, but right now he is in a very good place.“Hi Rob,” says Jon Millard. “Speaking of Statsguru as a frustrated opening batsman (meaning, one never, ever allowed to open the batting), I’ve always been fascinated by bat carrying. I’ve been trying to use Statsguru to find out the most frequent bat carrier - however, I am foundering on filtering out declared innings and successful chases. I know this a bit ‘let me Google that for you’, but can anyone either tell me who it is, or at least which filter to use? Probably only to find out it’s Boycott, I guess.”Two men have done it three times in Tests: Desmond Haynes and Dean Elgar. One of Haynes’ three was in that wonderful Test at the Oval in 1991, when he carried his bat by virtue of being the only batsman not intent on belting Phil Tufnell into Woolworths on Lambeth Palace Road.(Edit: here’s the full list.)84th over: England 313-4 (Crawley 170, Buttler 73) “Up late in Seoul very much enjoying this Test,” says Marcus Shaffer. “I’m no expert, but I would guess that the opener also has to deal with the anticipation imparted on the start of play by the crowd? The first action of any live event is really amped up. As play goes on the ball changes, the pitch changes, the weather changes, the crowd settles in. But openers have to absorb the starting energy of the crowd, satisfy it, and move it on... that is a skill that would be hard to teach.”I’d never really thought of that but it’s an interesting point. I wonder if it’s an even greater pressure in white-ball cricket, where you are expected to attack from the off, and therefore something you have to embrace. Most of the world’s best white-ball openers are not entirely without ego.83rd over: England 312-4 (Crawley 169, Buttler 73) Crawley famously improved his highest score in each of his first five Tests, but I’m afraid that particular game is up for a while: he’s 169 not out. That’s his best score in first-class cricket, never mind Tests.Buttler survives an LBW appeal after being hit on the pad by a decent inswinger from Afridi. It was slipping past leg stump. When Michael Gough says not out, only a fool reviews. Afridi is searching too hard for wickets, an understandable mistake in the circumstances, and later in the over he spears a very wide half-volley that Buttler pings over backward point for four. “Bill Griffiths said that if you hit a car it’s a four in Corfu,” says Jim Hornby. “I don’t suppose that is a Carrefour car park?”81st over: England 305-4 (Crawley 168, Buttler 67) Shaheen Afridi’s first delivery with the second new ball is also the first no-ball of the day. He celebrates with another two balls later, and another straight after that. A slightly farcical over continues with Crawley clipping a legitimate delivery for four, aided by a weary excuse for fielding from Yasir Shah at square leg.80th over: England 288-4 (Crawley 160, Buttler 65) Fawad Alam bowls the final over with the old ball. Crawley grabs the last sausage roll at the buffet, sweeping firmly round the corner for four, only to ruin a serviceable analogy when he is dropped by Fawad. It was a devilishly tough chance, on the half volley at ankle height off his own bowling, and it went through him. I think it carried to Fawad.Right, it’s time for the second new ball.79th over: England 280-4 (Crawley 153, Buttler 64) Since you asked, the last England batsman to turn a maiden Test hundred into a double was, yep, Robert William Trevor Key in 2004.78th over: England 275-4 (Crawley 152, Buttler 60) “As a Yank who has played in all of one cricket match for my daughter’s school dads PTA, a T20 match in which I had to bowl (aka chucking) two hilarious overs, and who has yet to grace the pages of Wisden, I of course have an opinion about England’s openers,” says Naresh Giangrande. “It seems to me that opening in a Test match is a very particular skill that simply isn’t taught. Why not? Why stick two poor souls into the position and let them get on with it?”I wouldn’t say it isn’t taught, though it certainly isn’t fashionable. Also, an important part of it, temperament, is something you’re generally born width. England’s current openers both have rock-solid temperaments and imperfect techniques it’ll be interesting to see which wins over the next couple of years. 77th over: England 271-4 (Crawley 150, Buttler 58) A thumping sweep for four off Yasir takes Crawley to 149, and he dabs a single to reach another milestone on a life-changing day: 150 not out from 233 balls. It’s been a marvellous innings! “Have played at the cricket ground in Corfu Town on a cricket ‘tour’,” says Bill Griffiths. “If you hit a car it’s a four. For some reason there were always far fewer cars in the car park when the home side were batting.”75th over: England 261-4 (Crawley 144, Buttler 54) Yasir continues after drinks. This is his 26th over, which is a lot for a spinner on the first day. A quiet over, genuinely two singles from it.74th over: England 259-4 (Crawley 143, Buttler 53) Fawad Alam comes back to bowl his roundarm SLA. Pakistan just want the second new ball now, they’ve had their fill of the first one. Crawley reverse laps a couple to move to within seven of a maiden daddy. I’d like to apologise for that sentence. That’s drinks.“Since Buttler is often held hostage by statisticians,” says Ian Forth, “allow me to point out that since Headingley last year his home Test average is currently 53.3. More than Gilchrist.”That’s admirable stat-cheating. In the same way that bookmakers offer a boost button to make the odds better, Statsguru should have an option to apply as many irrelevant filters as it takes to make your man looked good. Or vice-versa is you want to point out that Sir Donald Bradman averaged a pitiful 33.87 when Australia fielded first and lost.73rd over: England 253-4 (Crawley 138, Buttler 52) Yasir goes around the wicket to Crawley, who unfurls a jaunty reverse sweep for four. He repeats the stroke next ball, this time for a single. As Ian Ward says on Sky, he is clearly a very smart cricketer. Things change so quickly in Test cricket - less than a month ago, Rory Burns was an in-form banker - but right here, right now, a middle order (Nos 3-7) of Crawley, Root, Stokes, Pope and Buttler looks so exciting.“I’m not sure Vince really belongs in that list of No3s,” says Tom Booth. “There’s only so far you can get relying entirely on the off-drive. But I’ll come out swinging in the name of Ravi Bopara.”Was Bopara ever a No3 at Test level? I know he got those hundreds v West Indies but he always felt like a No56. Vince is probably the same actually, though I think we underestimate how well he played at times in Australia in 2017-18. 72nd over: England 244-4 (Crawley 131, Buttler 50) Crawley belts a full ball from Afridi through the covers for the 15th four of a quite marvellous innings. Afridi goes round the wicket after that and almost dupes Buttler with a clever slower ball. Buttler leant into the drive and inside-edged it back onto his pads it could easily have violated his furniture.  “Hi Rob,” says Bertie Heaver. “I’m following from Corfu which also turns out to be the home of Greek cricket. I can’t imagine Root or Kohli playing on an astro surrounded by a carpark only 30 metres away. The pavilion, however, could be the lovely Liston. A French building full of plenty of places for lunch and tea...”71st over: England 239-4 (Crawley 126, Buttler 50) Buttler waves Yasir for two to reach a majestic half-century from 85 balls, with six fours and two sixes. He must be so frustrated that this is the last Test of the summer, because he has waited 18 months to feel like this in the middle.70th over: England 236-4 (Crawley 125, Buttler 48) A quiet spell in the game, which is liveblog code for ‘I’ve been lost in my inbox for the last five minutes and haven’t seen a ball’. Buttler threads another excellent cover drive for four, this time off the returning Afridi, to move to 48. His placement has been immaculate today. It’s probably old age but I can’t remember him playing a more confident, authoritative Test innings. It’ll count for nowt if he doesn’t make a big score.“Hi Rob,” says James Burgess. “Is the Mark Lathwell in the 64th over the one who played two Tests in the 1993 Ashes?”No, that was Mark Lathwall.69th over: England 232-4 (Crawley 125, Buttler 44) “I really don’t see Burns as being ‘in poor form’ as has so often been stated,” says David Keech. “Let’s look at some cricketing realities. All pitches this year have been bowler friendly and both W. Indies and especially Pakistan have some high quality bowlers. Facing fresh bowlers with a new ball in helpful conditions, you expect wickets to fall. It’s just been Burns’ bad luck that he’s received the good ones. Wait until he bats on a few more batsman friendly pitches before passing terminal judgment please.”We’ll be waiting a while. I think we need to revise our expectations of batsmen, certainly in England, given the quality of bowling attacks and the change in pitches over the last few years. I haven’t crunched the numbers, so you could legitimately argue I’m pulling this straight from my hind, but I reckon an average of 40 in the last two years is worth at least 45 and maybe 50 in the earlymid-2010s.68th over: England 231-4 (Crawley 125, Buttler 43) “Quite astonishing that in 40 years, only three men have played 50 innings at number 3 and averaged above 40 for England (Hussain, Gower and Trott),” says Mike Jakeman. “Mind you, Australia have only had the same number over the same period, but that’s because they had Ponting (200 innings at 56) and Boon (111 at 45) immediately before him. Clearly such a rare set of skills. Or rather, so many skills required.”I was surprised Butcher’s average wasn’t higher, though I’d forgotten a few ducks early in his career (“It’s not much easier at No3, is it Butch?). If you take it from his recall in 2001 he averages 42.32 in 69 innings, which is very good in that position, especially in that era. You can make a case for a few lost No3s down the years: Hick, Smith, Ramps, even James Vince.67th over: England 229-4 (Crawley 123, Buttler 43) Buttler jumps into one-day mode, running down the track to blast Yasir back over his head for two sixes in three balls. The second went many a mile. He makes it 16 from the over with a gorgeous cover drive for four.66th over: England 213-4 (Crawley 123, Buttler 27) Mohammad Abbas returns in place of Nassem Shah, and Crawley moves back to thump him through cover point for four more. Since you asked, you cussing cursers, the last England batsman to turn a maiden Test hundred into a daddy (150+) was Jonny Bairstow on a surreal, emotional day in Cape Town almost five years ago. Before that it was Stuart Broad during a surreal, emotional Test at Lord’s in 2010.65th over: England 208-4 (Crawley 119, Buttler 26) Crawley survives an LBW appeal after again missing a sweep at Yasir. It was missing leg. The sweep stroke has been Crawley’s mainsole weakness today. “You mentioned Root would be loving this Crawley innings as it means he might not bat at No3 again,” says Luke Stevenson. “This being England, how likely is it if Burns’ poor form continues he’s dropped, Crawley then opens and Root bats No3, making nobody happy.” If that happens – and it’s still a fair way away – I think they’ll look for another opener rather than move Crawley. A good No3 is pure gold, and England might have found one. Things should only get complicated if Stokes returns and is unable to bowl.64th over: England 206-4 (Crawley 118, Buttler 25) Crawley pulls Naseem round the corner for four, despite the presence of three men out for the top-edged stroke. Naseem maintains his jaffa quotient later in the over with a beauty that zips away to beat Buttler. “On the subject of getting Shakespeare wrong ...” says Mark Lathwall. “Regarding your emendation of manner to manor when publishing my email: the former is the line from Hamlet, and the correct idiom. The latter is a pun on the phrase that was the title of a 70s TV show.” Well that’s my university application buggered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6790b7217a49000d4b6c354c13af873669dd5289/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f5fa0fa278d2f79170da60fd5ca7485b","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out.

Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast.

In a video message last week, DeVayne had asked fans to “keep me in your prayers, I’ll be back soon”.DeVayne had been diagnosed in 2018 with scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that causes the body’s connective tissues to scar and harden. World of Wonder, the production company that makes Drag Race, released a statement saying they were “heartbroken” to hear of the news, adding that DeVayne “spread a message of love and kindness that truly touched each person she met. Rest in power, Chi Chi.”Leading the tributes on Twitter, Drag Race host RuPaul said DeVayne was a “kind and beautiful soul … may her generous and loving spirit shine down on us all”.Shea Couleé, winner of the most recent series of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, said: “I’m devastated and sick to my stomach. Wake me up when it’s all over.”The Louisiana-born performer came to prominence during the eighth season of Drag Race, which aired in 2016. DeVayne also appeared on the third season of All Stars.The Drag Race franchise, a global hit, now boasts various international spin-offs including in Canada and Thailand.

They’re called the US Postal Inspection Service and they had authority to arrest Bannon and they did so … Somehow, the deep state launched agents of the US Postal Service to arrest Mr Bannon.”The “deep state” is supposedly a conglomeration of bureaucrats and law enforcement agents which exists to thwart Trump’s agenda. Bannon enthusiastically propagated the theory when he was Trump’s campaign manager in the 2016 election and then a senior adviser in the White House.However, since leaving Trump’s employ he has repeatedly cast doubt on the theory.In Deep State: Trump, the FBI and the Rule of Law by James B Stewart, published last October, Bannon said the “deep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases”, because “America isn’t Turkey or Egypt”.There is a formidable government bureaucracy in the US, he told Stewart, but “there’s nothing ‘deep’ about it. It’s right in your face.”Bannon also described to the journalist Michael Wolff, for his book Siege: Trump Under Fire, advice he gave to a ghostwriter working on Trump’s Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency, a book by Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.As quoted by Wolff, Bannon said: “You do realise that none of this is true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5618df491b42efb4645a1ea49464a9e95eb33e6/0_264_5082_3050/master/5082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2dc844fc0a2321fd48b4d8180c1a197","title":"berlin rename mohrenstrasse moor street black philosopher anton wilhelm amo","story":"Campaigners welcome decision after years of protest against ‘Mohrenstraße’ nameBerlin authorities have announced they are to rename  Mohrenstraße (“Moor Street”) in the city’s Mitte district after the country’s first black philosopher, Anton Wilhelm Amo.The decision follows years of protest by postcolonial campaigners, including historians and ethnologists, who had criticised the street name as racist.Campaigners welcomed the decision on Friday, which comes in the wake of a worldwide reassessment of the entrenched legacies of historical racism and colonialism.“Berlin is making history,” said the association Berlin Postkolonial in a statement. “We welcome this decision as an internationally visible signal against racism in the public realm.”The announcement followed a meeting among councillors from Berlin’s Mitte district at which the Greens and Social Democrats voted in favour of the move. They overruled a motion by the leftwing faction proposing the establishment of a naming committee which would have consulted the public over an alternative name.Campaigners are now waiting to see if the city’s public transport authority, BVG, will still press ahead with its controversial decision last month to rename Mohrenstraße on the U2 metro line as Glinkastraße, after the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka. That name is considered highly problematic because he and many of his works are perceived as antisemitic.Intensive political discussions about renaming the street have gone on for more than 15 years. It was viewed as offensive by many who argued that the name derived from black slaves in Germany in the late 17th century, while others saw it simply as an old-fashioned term not meant to be derogatory.But the recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations gave the row a new impetus. Some protesters renamed the street and metro station George Floyd Street with temporary placards, after the African American man killed during police arrest in May. Others added an “umlaut” or two dots over the “o”, turning it into “Carrots Street”.Opponents of the street name have long since referred to it simply as ‘M-Straße’.The initiative to rename the street Anton Wilhelm Amo came from the association Decolonize Berlin.Amo was brought to Berlin as a child slave from what is now Ghana in 1707 by the Dutch West India Company and had to serve as a so-called Kammer Mohr or “chamber moor” in the Prussian court. He later went on to study in Halle and Jena universities and became Germany’s first black philosopher. He is also believed to have been the first African-born student to attend a European university.Opposition to the renaming came from the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Its MP Martin Trefzer said those in favour of a name change were “sinning against the cultural identity of the city”. Oliver Frederici of the Christian Democrats (CDU) said “we disapprove of the obsession with renaming things”.Mnyaka Sururu Mboro, of Berlin Postkolonial, who has been hosting critical tours on the subject for more than two decades, said: “This is a great day: Berlin is banishing an offensive word from the city, and with Amo is honouring a campaigning scholar from Africa.”Protesters continue to call for the renaming of Onkel Toms Hütte, a metro station in the south-west of the city named after the 1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, objecting to the racist connotations.

Cai, an expert in Marxism and Chinese communist party theory, enthusiastically answered.She remembers how the friend, after listening to her responses, then asked: “Do you think communism can really be implemented?”Cai, who at that point had spent decades serving the party, was shocked. “No one had ever asked me this. I always felt everything I did was normal and natural, and I never thought about whether it was right or wrong,” she said.The friend followed up with another pointed question: “Do you know what you are like, what you are?” To Cai’s confusion, the friend said: “You are a preacher of the communist party,” – a proselytiser verging on religious fanaticism.“I knew being called a preacher for the Chinese communist party was a derogatory term,” she said, noting the negative connotation of religion within the party. “These two questions lodged in my mind,” she said. “I still think about them.”Over the past week, Cai, 68, has become a celebrated dissident to some and a reviled traitor to others. On Monday, she was expelled from the party after comments of hers calling the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, a “mafia boss” were leaked online in June.Following her expulsion, Cai gave the  permission to release a previously unpublished interview with her in which she went even further, blaming Xi for “killing a party and a country” and turning China into “an enemy” of the world – extremely rare criticisms of the top leader from within the party establishment.In the days since, state media have called Cai “a traitor” and an “extreme dissident” aligned with anti-Chinese forces in the US. “She has betrayed not only the oath of the party but also the interests of China and the Chinese people,” the nationalist outlet Global Times wrote.The central party school held a special meeting this week to strengthen discipline to prevent “major political incidents” as well as increase the political and ideological training of retired staff.“Party organisations at all levels and the entire school’s faculty and staff should take profound lessons from Cai Xia’s serious disciplinary violations,” the school said in a notice.Yet Cai, who has been overseas since last year, said she had lost neither sleep nor appetite, nor suffered anxiety from these attacks.“Whatever other people say, I will not be moved. I only care about whether my understanding is right or wrong. If it is wrong, I will fix it. If it is right, no matter what pressure I come under I will persevere. This is just my personality,” she said. “I know what I need to do.”Her outspokenness and willingness to criticise Xi are even more remarkable given her background. As the daughter of early party cadres, those who fought for the communist revolution that established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Cai belongs to an elite class known as the hongerdai, or “second red generation”, whose deep party roots often provide key connections.She was raised within the military in Jiangsu province in eastern China where parents taught her the importance of equality and stripped away any semblance of privilege. When Cai was eight, they dismissed the family nanny and Cai was ordered to do house chores such as cooking and cleaning.She grew up to be such a fervent believer that as an adult studying at the central party school in the 1980s, her classmates called her malaotai, “old lady Marx”, behind her back. She joined the party in 1982 after years of serving in the military. She also worked at a factory and as a schoolteacher before turning to academia.For Cai, the change in heart was gradual. In the early 2000s, when helping to draft a doctrine under the former leader Jiang Zemin known as the “three represents”, Cai was dismayed to see how Marxist theory was being used as a tool of propaganda. “This was the first time I realised that, in fact, some of the theories are deceptive and absurd,” she said.She remained hopeful, subscribing to the belief that the party could pursue progress and more openness, just slowly and with difficulty. “Because of what our parents have taught us – I believed that even though the party had corruption and many problems, it could reform and move forward,” she said.Yet, after Xi came to power in 2012, Cai began to believe that would not be possible. Xi strengthened social controls previously implemented such as “grid management”, a block-by-block system of social control and surveillance, and put in place more controls over the internet.In 2016, Cai wrote an article defending the property tycoon and party member Ren Zhiqiang, who had been put on probation after criticising Xi for demanding “absolute loyalty” from Chinese media. The article and Cai’s other essays were soon wiped from the internet. Later that year, Cai’s faith was further shaken by the death of the 29-year-old environmentalist Lei Yang after police choked him and stamped on his face.“I felt China’s return to the Cultural Revolution was already a reality,” she said, referring to the violent and fanatical years under Mao Zedong in the 1960s and 1970s. Seeing the dismissal of charges against the police involved in Lei Yang’s case and censorship of online outrage, Cai felt the party already showed it “had no sense of right and wrong”.Two years later, Xi oversaw the altering of China’s constitution to eliminate term limits, allowing him to stay on indefinitely – a process she described as being shoved down people’s throats “like dog shit”.“China’s communist party does not have the strength or the ability to take the country forward,” she concluded at the time.While Cai had become one of few outspoken intellectuals pushing for reform and defending other outspoken critics such as Ren, she was not severely punished until she spoke out against Xi this past year, a red line in today’s China which has seen a sharp crackdown on dissent under his leadership.Yet Cai’s punishment – she has been stripped of her benefits in retirement – as well as the attacks from state media are evidence of the threat she poses. Since her expulsion, friends and family have been calling at all hours to check on her, taking on risk to themselves, Cai said.Internet users have been posting Cai’s previous writings online in WeChat groups, while others have found ways around the Great Firewall to circulate her interviews with foreign media, including sites that are blocked in China such as the .“I didn’t expect that under this harsh environment people are still trying to express their support, concern and love for me. I am very moved,” Cai said. “People are still struggling to resist, to resist against his totalitarian regime. Chinese people have not given in. They are fighting in their own way,” she said.Her decision to speak out has not been without costs. Cai plans to appeal the decision to halt her benefits. She knows that she cannot return to China, and she worries about her family still in the country.While she aims to return to a quiet life of studying the Chinese communist party, her lifelong focus, she also feels compelled to continue pushing for change in her home country. It is for this reason that she takes issue with criticism that she is not patriotic.“If I did not care what happened to this country, if it weren’t for the people on this land, especially our children and grandchildren … I would not have tried my hardest to push for political change in China,” she said.“Conflict with the current system is inevitable, unless you become a slave and just follow him,” she said, referring to Xi. “You don’t have to think about your children or grandchildren and how they will live. But I can’t do this.”Cai thinks of her parents, who believed wholeheartedly in the revolution and in the people becoming the masters of their country. She believes there are many others like her, also hongerdai from within the party, who feel the same.“Our parents struggled and their efforts have not been realised. As their children we should continue their work,” she said. “Only by doing this can we be worthy of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ebdd893a330c1c1fe781f251b44632a8100139/0_113_5123_3076/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5130e1b718da877169fd127bd32146b9","title":"covid uk r value may be above 1 for first time on record coronavirus","story":"National figure is 0.9–1.1, with London, the north-west and south-west potentially above 1The R value for the UK may have risen above 1.0 for the first time since weekly reporting of data began.The figure reflects the average number of people a person infected with coronavirus passes the disease on to. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially.The official figure has previously reached 0.8-1.0 for the UK as a whole, but it has never moved above 1, although previous modelling has suggested it may have edged above this threshold in some regions.“We have been seeing indications that these values may be increasing, with estimated ranges increasing slightly from previous publications,” the team behind the data said. They urged caution, however, noting: “Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them.”Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We are seeing increases in new daily cases, and now we have an R number estimate that is approximately at the 1.0 threshold. The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission.“This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population,” he said, adding that difficulties in controlling the virus could be aggravated with the onset of winter because fewer people will be willing to meet outdoors.The north-west, London and the south-west could all have R values above 1.0, but the team said the estimates for the latter two regions were not robust because of factors such as low case numbers or a high degree of variability in transmission across the region.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, an expert in mathematical modelling at University College London, cautioned that when infection levels fall, there is high variability in transmission across the country and disease is spread down to localised clusters, R becomes a less useful figure.Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said local outbreaks were the most important focus, and that the R figures and growth rate did not show a clear trend. “It could be that the epidemic is growing, but it probably isn’t, it’s probably declining, though not very fast,” he said.Weekly data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that the coronavirus infection rate in England was continuing to level off, with around one in 2,200 iniduals having the virus and about 2,400 new cases a day for the week of 7–13 August, down from around 3,800 new cases a day the week before.“There is not enough evidence to say at this point that there has been a fall in incidence in the most recent week, therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off,” the team reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ed887c86765ad1aaaa28676a8c74ef1babdc8a/6_308_1988_1192/master/1988.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5e52f43229239fb7dc832652db10d93c","title":"uk cheap food could fuel covid 19 spread says who envoy","story":"Exclusive: Cramped work and home conditions may be behind infections in factories, says expertBritain’s demand for cheap food could be fuelling the spread of the coronavirus in factories, a leading health expert has warned, as analysis shows nearly 1,500 cases across the UK.Cramped conditions in some factories and in low-paid workers’ homes, spurred by the UK’s desire for cheaply produced food, may have driven infection rates in the sector, according to David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19.In the early stages of the pandemic, the UK avoided the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks seen in meat factories and other food processing plants in countries such as the US. But a  analysis suggests that reported UK outbreaks of the disease are now increasing in frequency, with examples of cases spreading into the wider community.While there is no suggestion of breaking social distancing rules, factories by their nature involve large numbers of workers under one roof.Unions say most of those working in UK meat, poultry and other mass food production plants are foreign migrant workers who share accommodation and transport. Nabarro, speaking in his capacity as a professor at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, raised the issue of low pay, which may mean employees exposed to the virus feel pressured to keep working. A culture of cheap food was based on driving production costs down – but at a price, he said.“It may well be that in keeping production costs down, we end up with a situation where the people who work in food processing are under very, very tough working conditions and are paid relatively small amounts of money compared with other roles.“So one could argue that this is not so much structural issues in society as a consequence of the perpetual pressure to get quality of food up and prices down. And so a part of this may require thinking carefully about how much to pay for particular kinds of food.”Nabarro said working and living conditions for food factory staff could create a perfect storm for the spread of the coronavirus. “If people are living in very high-occupancy, cramped conditions and they’re sharing transport, that obviously is another way in which transmission is likely.“So, if you add it together, the conditions inside the plants seem to contribute to the spread. The conditions of living and travel seem to contribute to spread. And the way in which money is handled if you’ve got to isolate may also contribute to spread.“So, the hypothesis that I have developed is that, in these cold plants where work is very intense, there are quite a lot of factors that come together that make infection with the virus more likely.”His comments may be seen to echo criticism of fast fashion for driving a culture of cheap clothing.Figures compiled by the  suggest at least 1,454 cases linked to food factories across England, Scotland and Wales.Northern Ireland, whose authorities do not publish specific statistics on the number of workers in the region’s large food processing sector, made food plants secondary only to healthcare when it was considering priorities for its contact-tracing app.In June, Boris Johnson acknowledged the problem in food processing plants, telling the Commons that ministers were investigating, but neither the government nor health officials were able to produce data looking specifically at it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f525bebfe5fad384516dc0c6180deb6f02d954/0_63_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f8388e53127b1c8529456c645664380","title":"us hurricanes simultaneous tropical storm laura","story":"Tropical Storm Laura currently lies at other end of Caribbean to a separate tropical depressionA tropical storm and a tropical depression at opposite ends of the Caribbean were projected to possibly become hurricanes, major storms which could hit the US simultaneously after drenching much of the region.The US mainland has not been hit by two tropical storms simultaneously since September 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression. Then, a category 3 hurricane hit Brownsville, Texas, while a tropical storm came ashore at Cedar Key, Florida.On Friday morning, Tropical Depression 13 became Tropical Storm Laura as it neared the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico as a disorganized storm with an uncertain future. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it might degenerate, or might blow up into a major hurricane headed for Florida and the Gulf coast.The current forecast track, highly uncertain, would carry Laura just north of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, across the Bahamas and then to southern Florida by Monday or Tuesday and the Gulf coast.On Friday morning, it was centered about 255 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and was heading west-northwest at 21mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 35mph.Tropical Depression 14, meanwhile, was nearing the coast of Honduras. The NHC said it was expected to veer north-west and cut across Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula on Sunday, possibly at or near hurricane force. A hurricane watch was in effect for the strip of coast containing Tulum, Playa del Carmen and Cancún, as well as Cozumel island.From there, the long-term forecast track would carry it to the US Gulf coast, perhaps Texas or Louisiana, by Tuesday or Wednesday – again, possibly, as a hurricane. En route, it is likely to soak flood-prone eastern Honduras, the Cayman Islands and parts of the Yucatán.On Friday morning, it was centered about 160 miles east of the Honduran resort island of Roatán with 35mph winds.

She could still be called on if Taylor or Ofqual’s chief regulator, Sally Collier, resigns.Williamson’s Department for Education (DfE) – after seeking approval from Downing Street – hurriedly issued a statement on Wednesday saying: “We have full confidence in Ofqual and its leadership in their role as independent regulator.”To placate Taylor, the DfE also confirmed that it had been Ofqual’s decision to drop grades decided by algorithm in favour of grades recommended by teachers, and that it had been backed by the government in doing so.More than a million people in Birmingham will be advised to limit the number of people entering their homes to two as part of voluntary restrictions to stave off a local lockdown.The UK’s second biggest city was placed on the government’s “watch list” on Friday as cases rose, prompting the council to suggest a series of voluntary measures which include limiting public gatherings to 30 people except for communal prayer and asking drivers and passengers in taxis to wear face coverings.There will also be a pause on any areas of the Birmingham economy opening up which remain closed, such as nightclubs and conference centres.Sushi chain Wasabi has launched a restructuring plan which could see up to 12 stores shut after sales were hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Sources told the PA news agency that a “handful of stores” could cease trading, with this potentially rising to “as many as twelve” depending on conversations with landlords.It is the latest sushi retailer to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) restructuring process after rivals Itsu and Yo! announced similar proposals in recent weeks.The company, which employs more than 1,500 and runs 51 sushi and bento shops across the UK, said it was “impacted profoundly” by lockdown measures introduced in March.Henry Birts, chief executive officer of Wasabi, said: Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, Wasabi had been performing strongly on the back of the investment and operational improvements we had made during 2019.However, the extraordinary impact of Covid-19 on trading has meant that we now need to take additional steps to address our fixed cost-base if we are to secure the long-term future of our business.In recent weeks, we have had constructive engagement with landlords regarding better alignment of the rents of certain sites in proportion with footfall and trading, and we will continue to work closely with them over the days ahead.We strongly believe that this turnaround programme will provide us with a stable platform upon which we can emerge from this difficult period as a healthy and sustainable business, for our staff, suppliers and loyal customers.Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said ministers had set out to protect the most vulnerable in society during the pandemic, concluding it was “important” to extend the eviction ban for a further four weeks.At the start of the pandemic we said that we would set out to protect the most vulnerable people in society.We did that by helping rough sleepers off the streets, we did it through the shielding programme and we did it importantly by ensuring that nobody could be evicted during the height of Covid.This week, we have reviewed the evidence as we said we would and concluded that it is important to keep that stay on evictions going for another four weeks.We have also put in place extra protections for renters, in particular a new six-month notice period before which proceedings could start.We’ve worked with the judiciary and the courts service, so that when the courts do reopen, they will rigorously prioritise the cases that come forwards, so that the first cases are the most egregious ones, including anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse.It’s time the government delivered on its pledge to end ‘no fault’ notices that allow landlords to throw people out on the street, writes Alicia Kennedy, director of the campaign group Generation Rent. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, pledged in March that no renter who had lost income due to coronavirus would be forced out of their home and introduced a ban on evictions in England and Wales. On Friday, after growing pressure from housing charities, MPs, legal experts and local authorities, the government extended the ban for four weeks.Postponing eviction proceedings will keep renters in their homes for now, but it’s just a sticking plaster. The number of private renters in arrears in England is double what it was this time last year, and for some the rent debt will keep racking up. The furlough scheme is coming to an end, unemployment continues to rise and benefit payments are insufficient to cover average rents. Without extra protections thousands of renters are at serious risk of losing their homes when the ban ends.Learner drivers were left unable to book a driving test on Friday after the website crashed under “unprecedented demand”.The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) started taking bookings for England and Wales once again from 8am, after several months of suspension due to lockdown.But people complained about problems arranging a slot on social media.When attempting to access the application page users were met with an error message.The DVSA said in a statement:Coronavirus has severely impacted our business as usual operations, including by stopping driving tests for many months as part of social distancing.Following unprecedented demand for the driving test booking system after its reopening, we are aware that some users have not been able to complete their test bookings.We are urgently working to fix this and apologise for any inconvenience caused to those who have been unable to book so far.The agency added: “There are limited numbers of tests available today but more will be released on Monday.“We’re not taking bookings for any further than 6 weeks in advance.”Learners whose tests were cancelled during lockdown were invited to rebook first in July.The DVSA said some 210,000 tests were cancelled and tens of thousands more were delayed because of the virus.Driving tests in Scotland are set to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot.All Btec students will receive their results by the end of next week following delays, the awarding organisation has said.A spokeswoman for Pearson said: “We have now written to colleges to confirm that all eligible results will be available by August 28.”It comes after hundreds of thousands of students were told last-minute that they would not receive their Btec results this week amid a U-turn.The exam board made the decision to review the grading of their level one to three Btec qualifications following Ofqual’s announcement that A-level and GCSE students would receive grades based on their teachers’ estimates.A statement from Pearson added: We know this has caused frustration and additional uncertainty for students, and we are truly sorry.No grades will go down as part of this review.The R value for the UK may have risen above 1.0 for the first time since weekly reporting of data began.The figure reflects the average number of people a person infected with coronavirus passes the disease on to. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially.This is the highest the R rate has been since the UK government started releasing the figures to reflect developments in the pandemic on 15 May.The official figure has previously reached 0.8-1.0 for the UK as a whole, but it has never moved above 1, although previous modelling has suggested it may have edged above this threshold in some regions.“We have been seeing indications that these values may be increasing, with estimated ranges increasing slightly from previous publications,” the team behind the data said.It is an increasingly common modern annoyance: arriving at the front of the queue to pay in a shop, pulling out a smartphone for a hygienic contact-free payment, and staring down at an error message because your phone fails to recognise your masked face.As more and more nations mandate masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus, technology companies are scrambling to keep up with the changing world. But some experts warn the change may have to start with users themselves.People across the UK are being urged to take up the call to be part of the ongoing and expanding study into coronavirus levels throughout the population.The head of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has encouraged people who are contacted to be part of the survey to make the “small commitment” in order to help “contain this terrible virus and get on with our lives”.Hundreds of thousands are likely to be asked to take part after officials this week announced plans to expand the programme to include 400,000 across the UK, up from the 28,000 people who are regularly being tested.By October, 150,000 people will be involved, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Professor Sir Ian Diamond, who is also the UK’s national statistician, said the response to date had been “brilliant” but that researchers were now “setting our sights higher”. He said: The more tests we do, the more accurate our figures will become. Without the best information we can’t expect the authorities to make the best decisions about imposing or lifting restrictions.We want to recruit up to 400,000 people right across England, with more in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland too. Their test results will give us a much more localised view of the presence of the virus down to city and county level.Addresses are randomly chosen and householders invited to take part in the coronavirus infection survey.The random selection, rather than volunteers coming forward, helps make estimates more scientifically reliable, Sir Ian said.Those who take part are tested once a week for the first month and up to once a month after that, by a trained visitor to their home “to make sure the test is done properly and safely”.The samples are then taken for analysis and results passed on to the volunteer’s doctor.Sir Ian said: “So, if you get our letter do please take part. You will be helping us all to contain this terrible virus and get on with our lives.”On Friday ONS figures showed that an estimated 24,600 people in private households in England had Covid-19 between August 7 and 13.The organisation said that while recent figures had suggested the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid-19 in households in England had risen slightly in July, this trend now appears to have levelled off.A contact tracer in the north-west tells how she has not been given any cases since she started in May: In 12 weeks I have not made a single call despite working 42 hours a week for £10.12 an hour. One of my friends started at the same time and they haven’t been assigned any cases either. We are not alone: we have a Whatsapp group comparing notes with other call handlers and quite a few haven’t had even one job the entire time.My understanding was that we were going to be allocated local cases. Given that the north-west has seen some of the biggest spikes in infections you would think we would be especially busy but apparently not.Outsourcing companies running the government’s flagship test-and-trace system have failed to reach nearly half of potentially exposed people in areas with the highest Covid infections rates in England, official figures show.The figures will prompt further scrutiny of Serco and Sitel roles in running a large chunk of the system. The two private firms, whose contracts are due for renewal on Sunday, were paid an initial £192m for the first three months of the programme, with the value of the contract reaching £730m over 12 months.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the system was not “world-beating”, as the prime minister has said.The biggest mistake was making it a commercially run thing. That was never going to work.I think it’s got better recently but that should never have been allowed to happen – that disconnect between the national and local level.Teams will be withdrawn from the Tour de France if two riders or staff show symptoms or test positive for Covid-19 under strict protocols from race organisers.However the race, which starts in Nice on 29 August, will continue even if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus in the peloton, according to an 18-page document shared with teams this week.“If two persons or more from the same team present strongly suspect symptoms or have tested positive for Covid-19 the team in question will be expelled from the Tour de France,” states the document, which has been obtained by the cycling website VeloNews.“Its riders will not be authorised to start the Tour de France (or the next stage) and the team’s personnel will have their accreditation withdrawn.”All team members will have to enter a “bubble” three days before the race by passing two Covid-19 tests – and everyone in the Tour entourage will be tested again on both rest days, 7 and 14 September.The government said 41,405 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of 5pm on Thursday, an increase of two on the day before.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 57,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.The government also said that as of 9am on Friday, there had been a further 1,033 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, 323,313 cases have been confirmed.The last time Boris Johnson went on a proper break, in January, he chose the Caribbean and stayed in a luxury villa on the island of Mustique that costs £15,000 a week.His summer holiday, it emerged on Friday, had a studiedly different vibe: a remote three-bedroom cottage on the coast of Scotland – with a tent in the garden.In some ways, the property fits the bill for the prime ministerial getaway: chintzy furniture, log-burner, a cot, pets allowed, will comfortably accommodate his family of three, appears ideally located to avoid passersby (or, at least, it must have done until a long-lens photographer of the Daily Mail showed up).But the tent?With Downing Street reluctant to be drawn on any aspect of the holiday, speculation about the canvas yurt abounded."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Activist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere have been a further 79 cases of coronavirus confirmed in the State, it was confirmed on Friday evening.No new deaths were reported.There have now been a total of 1,776 Covid-19 related deaths here along with 27,755 confirmed cases of the virus.Of the latest cases notified 73 per cent are under 45 years of age.Some 30 are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case while 21 cases have been identified as community transmission.In terms of where the new cases are located 43 are in Dublin, nine are in Kildare, six in Cork, six in Tipperary and the remaining 15 cases are in Clare, Donegal, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Roscommon, Wexford and Wicklow.  Earlier the Government announced a new package of financial measures to businesses in Kildare after agreeing to extend the lockdown in the county by two weeks due to the high number of Covid-19 cases.The lockdowns of neighbouring Laois and Offaly has been lifted, while the restrictions will remain for Kildare based on the advice of the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said further assistance would be provided to Kildare businesses following the decision to extend restrictions.“I realise how disappointing today’s news will be for the people of Kildare. It has been a devastating few months for business owners, their staff and families,” he said.“By extending these restrictions now, we will avoid further, more damaging measures later on. We must do everything we can to protect people. The people of Kildare are making a sacrifice on behalf of the entire country. I recognise that and we are redoubling our efforts to help businesses.”The local lockdowns of the three counties, introduced two weeks ago in response to a surge in Covid-19 cases linked to outbreaks in meat processing plants and food companies, were the first regional restrictions to be introduced by the Government during the five-month pandemic.Infections have remained high in Kildare during the two-week lockdown of the counties.Dr Ronan Glynn, the State’s acting chief medical officer, said on Thursday night there had been 455 Covid-19 cases in Kildare over the past 14 days compared with 81 in Offaly and 41 in Laois.Following the decision of Cabinet to lift restrictions for Laois and Offaly and to extend the lockdown for Kildare, Mr Varadkar announced the additional supports for businesses.The supports include large financial grants, greater assistance from the local enterprise office in Kildare, additional marketing grants and prioritised applications from Kildare for all schemes.“I’m particularly concerned about small businesses and those in the hospitality sector. I have asked the Local Enterprise Office to make a list of recommendations for further measures that Government can take to help businesses in Kildare to maximise trade over the next two weeks,” said Mr Varadkar.He said that the Government “will do everything we can to help.”It comes as another 20 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Department of Health, bringing the total in the region to 6,576.No further deaths with Covid-19 have been reported.Figures calculated by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) using information from death certificates, shows the total number of Covid-19-related deaths registered in the region to August 14th was 863.

Photograph: CollinsThe recently-appointed Supreme Court judge, Séamus Woulfe, has apologised for his attendance at the Oireachtas Golf Society event in a hotel in Clifden, Co Galway.Mr Woulfe, who served as Attorney General in the previous government, said he was not aware in advance that there was to be a dinner after the organised golf outing in Ballyconneely, which he attended as an invited guest.More than than 80 people are reported to have attended the dinner held to mark the 50th anniversary of the club.The judge said on learning of the proposed dinner during the course of the day, “my understanding was that the organisers and the hotel had satisfied themselves that they would be operating within Government public health guidelines.”Mr Justice Woulfe said he attended the dinner -held in the in the Station House Hotel on the understanding it would be within Covid-19 guidelines.“But I do apologise for any unintentional breach of any of the new guidelines on my part. “I would never disregard governmental or health authorities’ advice regarding public health, and have been at pains to follow rules and guidelines since their introduction in March. “That I ended up in a situation where breaches may have occurred, is of great regret to me, for which I am sorry. I unreservedly apologise.”It has been reported that the hotel room where the dinner was held was partitioned into two sections so as to comply with Covid regulations that no indoor event should be organised that involved a gathering of more than fifty people.However, when a number of speeches were being made, the partition was pulled back, according to reports.A seating plan published on social media shows Mr Justice Woulfe sitting at a table of eight, with other guests including the Moroccan ambassador to Ireland.The Courts Service has greatly reduced the range of court hearings that are being held because of social distancing rules that have seen an almost complete halt to jury trials.The service, and the judiciary, have over recent months been intensively involved in devising systems that would allow for a greater level of work to be conducted in the context of the ongoing pandemic.The Supreme Court has been able to maintain its workload by way of remote hearings, as it does not hear witness evidence.While the Taoiseach can sack a member of his Cabinet, the Chief Justice cannot force a member of the court to resign. Such decisions are a matter for the inidual judge.Mr Justice Woulfe is highly-regarded lawyer who is reported to have a good relationship with Chief Justice Frank Clarke. A judge can only be removed from his position if the Oireachtas votes to do so but nobody has suggested Mr Justice Woulfe’s attendance at the Clifden dinner would justify any such proposal.The recently-established Judicial Council provides for complaints to be made against members of the judiciary, but that section of the new regime has yet to become law.A Judicial Conduct Committee set up under the legislation that established the council, is currently drafting guidelines for how the system will work. The section of the law governing the complaints system will not be commenced until the guidelines have been adopted by the council.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335766.1598015236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"golf dinner reaction attendees should leave public life says gabriel scally","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Station House Hotel in Clifden – venue for the golfing dinner Politicians and public figures among more than 80 people attending an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner during Covid-19 restrictions “should leave public life and do something else”, a leading public health expert has insisted. Dr Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, said he was shocked and saddened over revelations about the large gathering at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, on Wednesday. Attendees appeared to be taking the attitude “do as we say, not as we do”, he said, adding: “This is absolutely wrong.”Dr Scally said it was not enough for leading political figures to resign and lie low for a while over the affair, with the hope of resuming office again in a few years. “They should leave public life and do something else,” he said. Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney show, Dr Scally said the Irish public had made extraordinary sacrifices in the battle to curb the spread of coronavirus and were being let down by those in power. Young people were being singled out by the Government over gatherings that were flouting official restrictions to control the pandemic. “Then they see this group of auld fellas out together,” he said. Dr Scally said a “clear and consistent message” is necessary and the onus is on Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to urgently develop a clear strategy on cutting the number of new cases to zero. Labour leader Alan Kelly said those who organised and attended the golfing dinner “have let Ireland down in one of the toughest periods in our history”. “This should never even have been contemplated,” he told The . “It was against all the regulations. It was against the previous regulations and the new regulations.”Mr Kelly said EU Commissioner Phil Hogan and Supreme Court Justice Séamus Wolfe – both of whom were in attendance – would need to be having “very strong conversations” on Friday about their role in public life. “I think the standard set by Dara Calleary’s resignation applies across the board. It was a massive misjudgment, it was totally wrong. People saw what was going on there, and, even if they weren’t aware beforehand they should have left.”Mr Hogan’s response, in a tweet, that he had been assured the event complied with Government guidelines was a “laughable excuse”, said Mr Kelly. “He didn’t even offer an apology,” he added, suggesting Mr Martin could express no confidence in the commissioner to the EU if he were not to resign. “If Séamus Wolfe was still the attorney general, I don’t think his position would be tenable either,” said Mr Kelly. “The Chief Justice may very well think the same. I’d be surprised if there isn’t a very strong conversation along those lines today.” The revelations have left the Government’s Covid-19 message in “tatters” while frontline health workers and those driving the public health response to the pandemic have been left “insulted”, the Labour leader said.“It is taking them for granted and it shows a level of arrogance, that the people who attended believe there is a two-tier system in Ireland, where there is one rule for an elite and different rules for everyone else. It’s abhorrent,” said Mr Kelly. It is “very difficult” now for politicians to ask the public to adhere to health guidelines, he added.

Photograph:  Mladen AntonovAFP via Getty ImagesAlexei Navalny is set to be airlifted to Germany for specialist medical treatment as Russia’s most prominent critic of the Kremlin remains in a coma after a suspected poisoning.The decision to allow for his evacuation after repeated denials came at the end of a day of intense lobbying by his family and supporters. They argued that remaining in a Siberian hospital was a threat to his life and was being ordered by Russian authorities who did not want the substance that had caused his illness to be discovered.President Vladimir Putin’s best-known critic ending up in hospital after drinking a cup of tea at an airport has underscored the threats against opposition activists in Russia. It has sparked demands by global leaders for a full investigation, following contradictory statements from the doctors treating him.Anatoly Kalinichenko, deputy chief doctor at the hospital in Omsk in southern Siberia where Mr Navalny has been in intensive care since Thursday, told reporters that they had found no traces of toxic substances in his system, and that he was “demonstrating a positive trajectory” and was “quite stable”.“The diagnosis of poisoning will remain at the back of our minds. But we don’t believe the patient was poisoned,” Mr Kalinichenko said.But earlier on Friday, Ivan Zhdanov, head of Mr Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said a police officer had told him Mr Navalny was poisoned with a substance “that poses a threat not only to him but to those around him” and that those treating the activist were required to wear protective equipment.Appeal to PutinApproval for Mr Navalny to fly to a Berlin hospital on a plane provided by private donors was granted late on Friday, after Mr Navalny’s wife Yulia made a public appeal to Mr Putin. The European Court of Human Rights said it was considering a special plea to permit the journey.Mr Navalny (44) had been in western Siberia meeting opposition candidates for local elections next month and filming video for one of his viral anti-corruption investigations on YouTube.He fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday and collapsed in the plane’s bathroom, where he groaned in pain before passing out and falling into a coma. The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk.As doctors continued to reject appeals for him to be granted permission to take the flight to Germany on Friday, Mr Navalny’s family said they feared the delay could harm his health or be part of a cover-up to make it impossible to determine what substance caused him to lose consciousness.“We think they are doing it so that the chemical substance in Alexei’s body disappears and there isn’t a trace left - that’s why they won’t hand him over. He’s not in a good condition and we obviously can’t trust this hospital,” said Ms Navalnya.German doctors who arrived on the plane were allowed to see Mr Navalny and told Kira Yarmysh, Mr Navalny’s spokeswoman, that they believed he was in a stable condition and could safely handle the flight.‘Medical decision’Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, earlier on Friday denied that the Kremlin was aware of any impediment to transporting Mr Navalny, except that it was “exclusively a medical decision”.Police prevented Mr Navalny’s team from speaking to the German doctors when they visited the hospital, after which the Siberian doctors claimed they had mutually agreed Mr Navalny was not fit to travel.The apparent poisoning would be the sixth such attack on Russian opposition activists in the past five years. Police refused to investigate all of the incidents, while doctors were unable to determine what was allegedly used to poison the activists.The EU expects “a swift, independent and transparent investigation” and that if poisoning was confirmed, “those responsible must be held to account”, bloc spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said in a statement.Mr Navalny’s exposés of official corruption on YouTube have earned him a wide following and a string of powerful enemies among Russia’s officials and oligarchs.As the price of his activism, Mr Navalny has been jailed 13 times for protesting against Mr Putin, sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence that judges abruptly commuted the next day after it sparked a rally outside the Kremlin, and harassed around the clock by trolls allegedly working for St Petersburg businessman Evgeny Prigozhin.In 2014, his younger brother Oleg was jailed for three years in a case Mr Navalny described as “hostage-taking” in retaliation for his activism.BlindedLast year Mr Navalny claimed he was poisoned with an unknown substance that provoked a severe allergic reaction while serving one of his many short jail sentences for protesting against Mr Putin. In 2017, a pro-Kremlin activist attacked Mr Navalny with a chemical that left him partially blind in one eye.The EU and UK expressed concern over Mr Navalny’s health on Thursday, while French president Emmanuel Macron said France and Germany would offer “all necessary assistance to Navalny, in terms of healthcare, asylum and protection”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335819.1598019749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden s hour five takeaways from the democratic convention","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential nominee Joe Biden and California senator Kamala Harris, his running mate, at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Delaware. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesThe Democratic National Convention came to a close on Thursday night with Joe Biden’s speech accepting his party’s nomination for president. The balloons and ticker tape may have been absent this year, but the high point of the election calendar still packed a punch.Here are some of the highlights:The virtual conventionThis convention was like no other, as organisers were forced to design and implement an online-only gathering. The result? A surprising success. For two hours each night, millions of Americans tuned in to the virtual-only event. The curtailed timeframe forced speakers to keep to their allotted time, while the absence of applause, cheers and interruptions kept things moving. Technically, there were remarkably few hitches. The content was slickly produced, and included stylish musical contributions from stars like John Legend and Billie Eilish.‘We the people’\u0026nbspOne effect of the Covid-era convention was to elevate the voice of ordinary Americans. A highlight was the traditional “roll call” when states cast their votes. The result was a Eurovision-style whirl across the 50 US states and seven territories. From the blue-skied expanses of Montana, to the flashing lights of the Las Vegas strip, the montage showed America in all its richness and ersity. On Thursday, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington spoke about how Biden had helped him with his stutter – one of the many personal stories that stood out during the week.The Bernie brigadeThe last time Democrats gathered for their convention four years ago, the event was overshadowed by tensions between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. This time, all efforts were made to ensure that differences between the progressive and centrist wings of the party were kept under wraps. But there was unrest. Supporters of left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, asked why she was given only one minute of speaking time – particularly when Republicans such as John Kasich, former Ohio governor, spoke for longer. Biden too made minimal references to more left-wing policy perspectives during the convention, no doubt disappointing Republicans eager to paint him as an empty vessel for the “radical left”. While mumblings of discontent over AOC were kept in check, the demands of the progressive flank of the party will likely resurface post-election.The ObamasAlmost four years since Barack Obama left the White House, America’s first black president and his wife Michelle still have star quality. Their speeches this week show why. Michelle Obama’s opening night address distilled the essence of her appeal to millions of people – a no-nonsense, relatable person (“you know I hate politics” she said at one point) who nonetheless remains hopeful about the innate goodness of all Americans. Her tone of restrained exasperation with the presidency of Donald Trump, coupled with an urgent appeal to Americans to vote, captured the mood of many in the country.Her husband delivered his speech from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the constitution, on Wednesday night. It was former president Obama’s most direct attack to date on his successor. Trump, he said, had “shown no interest in putting in the work no interest in finding common ground no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends”.Like his wife, his speech also contained an instruction to the millions of Americans watching – to exercise their right to vote in November. Such was the power of Obama’s oratory that he arguably overshadowed vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris who spoke directly after him. Reportedly, Obama had been slated to close the events, but insisted that Harris be given the final slot.The BidensJill Biden may be known to many Americans having served as second lady, but her appearance at the convention will have endeared her to many more. In an innovative take on the traditional convention speech, she delivered her address from an empty school in Delaware.“When I taught English here at Brandywine High School, I would spend my summer preparing for the school year about to start filled with anticipation, “ she began, looking deep into the camera. “But this quiet is heavy. You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways. There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors,” she said, instantly connecting with millions of parents around the country.But it was her husband who ultimately was the stand-out contributor. So much was riding on Joe Biden’s speech. He rose to the occasion.Less a convention speech than a presidential address, the content and his delivery quietened those who doubted his mental acuity and ability. The challenge in the next 10 weeks will be to ensure that he continues to reach the bar he set on Thursday night.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mercy statisticians pandemic","story":"Just as the assassination of JFK was the first global event to take place in the age of rolling TV news, Covid-19 is the first pandemic to happen in the age of daily statistical bulletins. We have become glued – or perhaps imprisoned – by the endless onslaught of figures for deaths, new cases, hospitalisations.Our lives can be thrown upside down when they move in the wrong direction – any country that starts registering more than 20 new cases per 100,000 people can expect to be put on Britain’s quarantine list. Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the New Zealand government announced four – yes, four – new cases in the city.Only belatedly are we coming to realise that the statistics fed to us do not always mean what we think they mean. Until last week Public Health England was counting as a Covid death anyone who had died after testing positive for Covid 19, even if that was months ago, they never showed any symptoms and went on to be run over by a bus.This morning it transpires that the statistics for hospitalisations were compiled in the same way – anyone who went into hospital and tested positive for Covid 19 was counted as a Covid case, even if they had fallen off a ladder. By the same token, the common cold could be made out to be consigning to emergency wards and killing many tens of thousands of people in Britain every year.There’s another statistical oddity we need to be aware of, too. In recent weeks Spain has become the seat of what has been called Europe’s ‘second wave’. Recorded new cases have leapt since bottoming out in June, with 35,582 of them being recorded in the last seven days – constituting a peak nearly as high as that in April. Yet if so many are catching Covid 19 why aren’t they dying or going to hospital?While there has been a small rise in hospitalisations in recent weeks it is nothing compared to what was happening in the spring. In the past seven days, 1407 have been hospitalised with Covid 19 and 122 have died – compared with nearly 900 deaths every day at the height of the epidemic. While you would expect a lag between new recorded cases and deaths, in the spring there was only a gap of seven days between peak new cases and peak deaths. The ‘second wave’ in new cases has been evident for seven weeks now.It is only when you look at the small print in the Spanish health ministry’s daily dispatch that you realise something amiss. Up until 10 May, Spain was only counting in its daily tally on new cases people who had tested positive in PCR tests – the ‘do you have it?’ test which detects traces of the actual virus in swabs of the nose and mouth.From 11 May, however, Spain started adding to the figure people who had tested positive in IgM tests, assuming they had also displayed some symptoms. The IgM test is the ‘have I had it?’ test, which looks for antibodies in the blood. This doesn’t start picking up cases until around 14 days after infection. In other words, Spain is counting in its daily total people who had the virus weeks ago.Sooner or later we are going to have to have an inquiry into the role of statisticians in the Covid 19 crisis. They will have to be put in the hot seat and grilled as to whether they contributed to the sense of panic which has gripped so many people and disrupted normal life for so long.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust plans better manage carbon impact visits","story":"The National Trust is planning to discourage visitors from making lengthy journeys to its country properties, according to a briefing document seen by the .Under the proposals, the trust is seeking to “reduce journey times and increase non-car access” to its vast portfolio of stately homes and gardens. In doing so it hopes to “better manage the carbon impact of visiting”.The document said there will come a need for a “shift from a reliance on days out to more flexible community use”.The plans, contained in a 14-page briefing document entitled “Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences”, will raise eyebrows amongst some of the National Trust’s most loyal members for whom a day out by car to a country property is one of its great joys.Written by Tony Berry, the heritage charity’s visitor experience director, the document was drawn up in response to the lockdown which it says has accelerated “some tricky choices” for the National Trust over “which activities to stop, start and continue”.The National Trust, which has six million members, is proposing 1,200 redundancies to make up for the financial shortfall caused by the pandemic. It employs 15,000 staff and 70,000 volunteers across its huge estate of historic houses and castles. It is not clear how the Trust could achieve more localised visits when so many of its properties are away from urban centres in rural areas hard to reach without a car.It complains that “its current visitor model puts a disproportionate load on peak times” and that the “outdated mansion experience” largely serves “a loyal but (by 2030) dwindling audience”.Mr Berry instead promotes a new vision over the next decade by “building long-term, deep and sustainable relationships with people who live close by. That will allow us to better manage the carbon impact of visiting, by reducing journey times and increasing non-car access”. Critics of the National Trust’s current management will raise concerns that the charity plans to raise more money by increasingly hiring out stately homes for “specialised experiences”.The charity has been accused in recent years of ‘dumbing down’ and under its current proposals to save money its national specialists in areas including textiles, furniture and libraries face redundancy.Dr Amy Boyington, an architectural historian said: “This again feeds in to the whole ‘dumbing down’ of history within the NT, where it believes that to be accessible to everyone it needs to make history flashy, punchy and Disney-esque.”Dan Hicks, author and curator at Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, said: “As well as just houses and gardens, the National Trust cares for nationally significant collections of objects, archives, photographs, and more – so the prospect of losing expert librarians, archaeologists and curators is deeply worrying.”In a statement, the National Trust said: “The Trust document on a vision for places and experiences was an internal discussion document to look at possible ways forward as we emerge from the coronavirus crisis. It is not a strategy.“We remain committed to, and passionate about, the country house and arts and heritage. And we will not dumb down.We will always welcome the enthusiasts and the specialists and provide them with experiences that are tailored for their interests, such as at places like Kingston Lacy and Petworth – where we ensure those treasure houses are presented to the highest possible standard.“But we also want to ensure there is something for everyone in our houses, taking visitors from their first encounters with our heritage and onto discovering ever-greater treasures from different houses. “We accept that the presentation of some of our houses can be improved and we need to make sure they are meaningful and relevant for the 21st century. We want to move away from a one-size-fits all model and to focus on the ersity of our places and ensure we make the most of our collections.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parts britain seeing higher infection rates one four european","story":"The North West of England has a higher coronavirus infection rate than over a quarter of European regions where returning Brits must quarantine for two weeks, the latest data shows.The region has had 46 new infections of Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the two weeks to August 16 - higher than in  95 regions across 11 European countries which have been or are about to be removed from the government\u0027s list of safe travel destinations, according to the most recent data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).  This includes 17 of the 21 regions of Croatia, due to be removed from the safe list at 4am on Saturday, and 13 of the 18 regions of France, which was taken off the list last Saturday.Croatia\u0027s ambassador to the UK said he regretted that the Government here had not taken a regional approach, instead of enforcing quarantine for people returning from any part of the country.Igor Pokaz told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: In Croatia we have, as I said, witnessed these spikes in certain areas - for example in Zagreb in the capital and maybe among the young population.But in Dubrovnik, its surroundings and the islands there were very, very few cases. And I deliberately mention Dubrovnik and the islands as that is where most of the British tourists go. Parts of the North West of England - including most of Greater Manchester - are still under lockdown, with measures including a ban on socialising with other households in indoor venues and visits to friends or families in care homes.So too is Aberdeen, which had restrictions such as the shutting down of pubs and restaurants extended on Wednesday by the Scottish government. The city lies in the region of Grampian, which has the highest regional infection rate in the UK at 60 cases per 100,000, higher than over 112 of regions of blacklisted European countries. Across 401 regions in Europe ning 30 countries, the average rate of new infections in the two weeks running to August 16 for those in a country on the UK\u0027s air bridge list is 13 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000, according to the ECDC data.That compares to 59 cases per 100,000 for  regions in countries where returning Brits are now required to quarantine for two weeks, which will also include Austria as of Saturday.Over half of the top ten worst infected regions in Europe are in Spain. Aragon, the region of city Zaragoza and to the west of Catalonia, is the region with the highest infection rate at the moment, with 336 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 - over 25 times worse than the current UK regional average of 13.Not far behind is Madrid\u0027s autonomous region, where there are 257 cases per 100,000.The region of Guyane is the worst infected in France, with fortnightly cases standing at 245 per 100,000.Several Romanian regions are also among some of the worst hit, with Arges, Vaslui and Prahova seeing infection rates of 182, 179 and 160 respectively. Regions data is based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) published in the European Centre for Disease Control\u0027s weekly release.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian doctors block kremlin critic alexei navalny transfer","story":"Russian doctors on Friday refused to let opposition leader Alexei Navalny out of the country for treatment after an alleged poisoning, in what his team called “an attempt on his life”. Mr Navalny, a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin, remains hospitalised and in a coma after suddenly falling ill during a flight to Moscow from Siberia.Alexander Murakhovsky, head of the hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk where the plane was forced to make an emergency landing, told reporters that Mr Navalny’s condition was unstable and he could not be moved.Specialists had flown in from Moscow and there was no need for foreign doctors to examine the patient, he said.The hospital\u0027s deputy head doctor added that no evidence had been found to indicate that Mr Navalny had been poisoned.Anatoly Kalinichenko told journalists: We do not believe that the patient suffered from poisoning. We have practically a full diagnosis...unfortunately, I cannot discuss this with you now.Mr Navalny’s team said they had been working to evacuate the activist to Germany and that a plane was already waiting in Omsk to transport him. “The ban on transporting Navalny is an attempt on his life, which is being made right now by doctors and the deceitful authorities who sanctioned it,” spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said. Mr Navalny’s wife Yulia, who was initially prevented from seeing her husband when she arrived at the hospital, said doctors were playing for time so that “the chemical that is in Alexei’s body might disappear”. “We cannot trust this hospital and we demand that they release him to us,” she told reporters.Ivan Zhdanov, the head of Mr Navalny’s anti-corruption organisation, said officials had found a substance in the opposition leader’s system that was dangerous “not only to Alexei, but also for those around him, and that everyone should be in protective suits”. Officials declined to provide further detail about the substance, saying this was an investigative secret, according to Mr Zhdanov. Doctors said they have “five working diagnoses” and need two more days for further tests.Mr Navalny’s spokeswoman alleged he was poisoned from a cup of tea at the airport before boarding the flight to Moscow. Video taken by another passenger on the flight shows stewards with first aid kits walking to treat a man crying out in pain. In another video, Mr Navalny is shown being transferred on a stretcher to an ambulance waiting on the tarmac. Mr Navalny is a Yale-educated lawyer with a wide following in Russia and a popular YouTube channel where he presents investigations into corruption by officials. The father of two was barred from standing against Mr Putin in Russia’s most recent presidential election and has been repeatedly jailed for organising anti-Kremlin protests. Mr Navalny was hospitalised from a Russian last year with an acute allergic reaction that he and his doctor said could have been caused by a “toxic agent”. The official explanation was dermatitis. In 2017 he suffered a serious chemical burn in one eye after an assailant threw green dye in his face outside of his Moscow office.He is not the first critic of Mr Putin to be targeted. Five years ago, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was killed in a drive-by shooting near the walls of the Kremlin. A group of Chechen men were jailed for the attack but questions remain over who ordered the killing.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"singapore scientists find coronavirus variant milder infections","story":"Researchers in Singapore have discovered a new variant of the Covid-19 coronavirus that causes milder infections, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal this week.The study showed that Covid-19 patients infected with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 had better clinical outcomes, including a lower proportion developing low blood oxygen or requiring intensive care.The study also showed the variant, which has a large deletion in a part of its genome, elicited a more robust immune response.The study involved researchers from various Singapore institutions, including the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the Duke-NUS Medical School and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.These studies provide the first convincing data showing that an observed genetic change (mutation) in SARS-CoV-2 has affected the severity of disease in patients, said Gavin Smith at Duke-NUS.The scientists said the findings had implications for vaccine development and treatments for Covid-19.The variant, which likely came from Wuhan, China, was detected in a cluster of infections that occurred from January to March 2020. In Singapore, the virus was transmitted from person-to-person across several clusters before being contained.An expert told Reuters this week that mutations in viruses may be a good thing. Viruses tend to become less virulent as they mutate so as to infect more people but not to kill them as they depend on the host for food and shelter, according to Paul Tambyah at Singapore\u0027s National University Hospital.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"abyssal spider trailer watch poster plot release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Is 2020 not bad enough?’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Kieran Smith, the creative director at Bake Off’s production company, told Broadcast, “So many people rely on Bake Off for work that we knew we had to work out a plan.”   Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAll contestants and judges lived together at a South East location in July. They were joined by 80 members of the production team, 20 hotel staff and approximately 20 children, as well as multiple chaperones and dog walkers. The strenuous measures began even before that with the team having to self-isolate for nine days and take three Covid tests prior to moving into the South East location. Smith called the six-week shoot a “gruelling” experience, working on a “two days on, two days off” basis.In order to avoid the use of public toilets, transportation from the baking tent to their nearby accommodation also had to be arranged. “It was a massive operation,” said Smith.The creative director revealed that during the filming there was one Covid scare, which turned out to be a false alarm.

The space station can be repressurised using nitrogen tanks that are taken to the space station on cargo missions.Cosmonaut shares video of unidentified \u0027objects\u0027 flying over EarthBut Nasa hopes that isolating the problem will finally allow it to be fixed and allow the space station to return to normal operation.The test will see the three crew members who are currently in the floating lab spend their weekend inside the Russian part of the space station.The Zvezda service module served as the living quarters when permanent habitation of the space station began in 2000, and they will still have access to the Soyuz ship that delivered them to the ISS and will take them home.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high?

A stf of a game show dreamt up by Simon Cowell’s Over The Top Productions company and hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who charged on to the set, Saturday night, shouting: “Oh yes, I hope you’re ready. This is going to be good.”It wasn’t, obviously. It was going to be anything but good.Rolling In It is a show where every single thing is working against it being good, in fact, from the fixtures and fittings to the ropey old format where they’ve attempted to fuse the random “thrill” of Tipping Point with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , minus the decent cash prize.The technology here isn’t exactly state of the art either. It’s an old arcade game. So, before answering  lobotomised questions , the contestants must roll a gigantic coin down a chute which can end up in a cash prize basket, but more often than not ends up bankrupting them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, as you’ve probably noticed, is currently playing exactly the same game with the British economy and probably thinks Rolling In It is a fantastic idea for a game show.ITV in its heart of hearts, though, clearly does not. How can you tell Because they’ve had to ditch the normal, run-of-the-mill contestants and partner-up some visibly reluctant ITV celebs with X Factor-style “characters” who are meant to ert your attention from the game.Saturday night, we had a live wire called Jana, who announced her arrival by telling Mulhern he’d “lost weight”. “What ”The week before there was another handful by the name of Lesley, who brought proceedings to a temporary halt, at the introductions’ stage, with this announcement. “I arrange funerals.”I’d stick around then, Lesley. I’ve checked this show’s vital signs and I think we’re talking weeks rather than months.I worry, too, about the long-term prospects of ITV in the current climate.The share price is down, advertising’s hit an all-time low, Ant  Dec are wintering in Rhyl and the new home for I’m A Celeb is literally a folly.The very remote possibility exists, I will admit, that Rolling In It is part of a deep-state plan to frighten everyone back to work — “Return to the office NOW, or you’re getting a second series of this rubbish.”But I don’t think we really need to look beyond the obvious lockdown explanation here.The cupboard is bare.ITV has simply run out of anything  worth showing, we’re now on to the stuff that was never meant to see the light of day, and as good as it’s ever going to get for Rolling In It is Gemma Collins revealing that: “My intuition is telling me shot put.”Then please go with your intuition, Gemma. Team GB demands it.Nasser Hussein: “The three non-negotiable players were Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe and Gough.”Paul Merson: “Every City signing is just another cog in the jigsaw.”Steven Gerrard: “The quality on the bench is the quality that’s not even on the bench.” BBC’S re-run of the original and arguably best Line Of Duty series concluded, last night, with the Organised Crime Gang still on the loose and DCI Tony Gates putting his tortured Irish wolfhound out of its misery before killing himself.The character I always feel sorry for, watching this  version of the show, though, is Jackie Laverty, Gates’ miserable girlfriend, who had her throat slit in the second episode.She was then stashed in Terry’s freezer, just behind the crispy pancakes and Cornettos, until her corpse was dramatically rediscovered in the fourth episode of the fth series, in April , looking almost as gormless as DI Buckells.In the process, she missed: The show’s big move to Belfast, in series two, the DI Denton years, with Keeley Hawes, balaclava man, Thandie Newton’s appearance, Ted Hastings’ long, dark nights of the soul at the Edge Park hotel, and DS Steve Arnott’s subtle transition from grey tank tops to lurid waistcoats, straight after he slept with DC Georgia Trotman at the beginning of the second run.I’d imagine Jackie actress Gina McKee casts a frosty stare or two in the direction of her agent as well.Line Of Duty may never have been so gloriously easy to understand, or free from abbreviations, as it was in series one, but while her character’s been solidying at Terry’s gaff it has become the most consistently brilliant drama of the decade.Sadly for her, Jackie Laverty is not actually due to defrost fully until series seven and the next runis going to be the last.No official word yet as to when that production will reach our screens but, you can guarantee already, Line Of Duty’s final episodes will be the television event of the year.BBC’s new sitcom Mandy  Well I came and I watched without laughing.

In fact, I wonderin some ways we’ve ever had it so good.In football, the Leeds, West Brom and Fulham fans among us have the precious memories of heart-stopping promotion moments to cherish for ever.Similarly, while Liverpool fans would have preferred to have partied with their team, none of them will ever forget the evening Cha did them a favour and the title was theirs. And the intensity of Watford and Bournemouth fans’ misery at relegation will have been no less keenly felt without them being present.In fact, let’s be honest, under the circumstances they might well have been far better off at home anyway.Whether we were there or not turns out not to have mattered quite as much as we thought it would.Watching at home, we even got used to the crowd noise sound-effects. They seemed like the daftest idea ever at first, but so skilfully was it done that I was quite at home with it by the end of the season.I’ve loved the cricket too. I can’t tell you how much I normally enjoy being there for these matches, they’re the greatest joy of the sporting summer. Hordes of inebriated, sunburnt fans howling on their teams, whether I’m one of them, or watching at home, are all part of it. But watching the West Indies and Pakistan Test series unfold even without the mayhem of the crowds has been wonderful.Will, for example, Chris Woakes’ performance in the first Pakistan Test live any less long in our fondest memories for having been played out behind closed doors  Will Chris himself be any less delighted with it  Will his grandchildren care as he rocks them on his knee and tells them about his four fabulous days at Old Trafford in the weird summer of  Actually, you could forgive Chris for not being desperate to have crowds coming back. He played out of his skin behind closed doors in Manchester, and saw his football team, Aston Villa, save themselves from relegation in another deserted stadium days earlier.As for the snooker, pandemic or not, spectators in or out or a bit of both, we were still captivated.As it happens, I watched the Fulham v Brentford play-off final, and some of the snooker, in a sports bar in a hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia, while an absolutely apocalyptic electric storm raged outside. I sat there with a handful of other Brits, riveted to the screens even as the roof of the place proved unequal to the task of keeping out the rain. What I can only describe as a waterfall soon started cascading into the middle of this bar. And yet we watched on, intently, as teams of Croatian hotel staff rushed around us with mops, buckets and a big kind of water Hoover thing. Nothing could tear us away. Even when something fused and it all went dark, we just filed on to the terrace and watched the storm with one eye, while with the other we watched data from the snooker and football flash up on our phones. Pandemics, floods and whatever  — bring on the plague of locusts — nothing, but nothing, can stop the sport getting to us, and us getting engaged with the sport.And nothing, ever, can stop Ronnie O’Sullivan being Ronnie. First he said the players were being treated like lab rats, then he said a lot of his fellow lab rats were hopeless snooker players anyway. And then he goes and wins the thing. You can’t keep a good bad mad man down, can you Why has sport still managed to grab us by the scruff of our necks in these troubled times  I think there are three reasons: Firstly, we missed it so much when it wasn’t there at all. We loved it before, but we really didn’t know how much until it was completely taken away for us.Secondly, without the crowds, though they are missed, what we’ve been left with is the naked, untrammelled intensity of sporting endeavour. There’s no noise and fervour in the stadia to detract from the purity of the contest.And thirdly, most importantly, the bond between sport and us, between those who play it and those who watch it, is so strong that nothing, but nothing, can ever break it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we can do everything possible to ensure our kids never miss a lesson again.”THE Chinese government’s horric treatment of Hong Kongers and Uighur Muslims violates every human rights law in the book.So we’re pleased that British ministers and royals are plotting to snub the rogue state by boycotting the  Winter Olympics.We know it’s just a gesture. But it’s an important one. When Britain refused to send dignitaries to Russia for the  World Cup, it galvanised our allies to stand up to Putin’s bullying.Two years on, the world is finally waking up to the menace that is China.And we’re proud that once again, Britain is leading the way.NEWS that deaths involving Covid have dropped to a level not seen since March is cause for cautious celebration.It’s proof that we really are over the worst of the virus — and that it’s safe for Brits to come out of hibernation.At the height of the pandemic, we rightly stayed at home to protect the NHS and save lives.Now, it’s our civic duty to protect the economy and save livelihoods by going back to work, to school and to the shops.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Office for National Statistics data showed footfall at all retail locations is up to  per cent from a low of around ten per cent in early April.Shopping centres and High Streets are back to  per cent of last years levels of visitors.Ninety-three per cent of businesses are back open. Seventy-seven per cent of firms said there was no risk or a low risk they could go bust.Goods vehicles are once again clocking up their usual mileage. And overall road traffic is just nine per cent lower than before lockdown.Tonight, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “It’s great to see people back out and about, using our roads to boost business and drive our economic recovery.Sun readers will be happy to see that we’re setting out plans to spend £billion on improving our roads — reducing congestion, pollution and journey times. And we aim to cut through red tape and get projects done faster.”But while many drivers are getting back on the roads, commuters are still shunning trains and buses.Train passenger numbers are only at  per cent of last year’s levels. And bus usage is at just  per cent of what it was.In London, where millions of office staff are still working from home, Tube passenger numbers are  per cent the level of last year. The capital’s buses are only  per cent full.A third said lockdown had not aff­ected their turnover for this year. But half said they had seen a decrease.Just one in eight of the workforce remains on furlough.Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to boost restaurants, cafes and pubs was used  million times last week. Data up to Monday of this week showed road traffic just nine per cent lower than the equivalent Monday in February. Britain’s White Van drivers are back to  per cent of pre-Covid- rates.ONS senior statistician Chloe Gibbs said: “Road traffic data shows the number of car journeys is ing to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work.”But many huge firms are still telling workers to stay home and it is having a major knock-on effect on rail, Tube and bus commuter numbers and the wider urban economy.It is a huge blow for cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester. Their centres became ghost towns during lockdown.Cafe chains including Pret a Manger have announced job cuts as a result of having fewer customers.Rail usage has slumped to  per cent of last year’s levels, the Tube at  per cent and buses at  per cent.NEWS that Britain is bouncing back to normality is music to our ears.Last month, behavioural scientists worried that nervous Brits might let the economy tank rather than come out of hibernation. But they underestimated our resilience: High streets up and down the country are bustling once again . . . and ever-dependable White Van Man is back out on the road.We caution, though, against getting lulled into a  sense of security.New ONS data reveals that a whopping  per cent of employees are STILL on furlough, proving the extent to which the job retention scheme continues to prop up the economy.As the scheme tapers off, it’s inevitable that thousands of hardworking and blameless employees will be let go.We’re concerned too about the future of offices — and the cleaners, shop owners and transport workers who depend on their survival for work.On the Continent, the vast majority of city workers are back behind desks. But in the UK, business districts are ghosttowns as white collar employees find they like the work-from-home lestyle.It would be churlish not to celebrate today’s good news. But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.  Tonight Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith warned: “Office workers, civil servants, those in big companies are really being shown up by the self-employed and small businesses who are all getting back to work and are thus helping the economy.“Its down to these businesses and their office workers to recognise their responsibility, and get back to the office so they can help all the smaller businesses, the cafes, restaurants and bars in the centre of our towns and cities, so they are able to prosper again.”A No spokesman said: “This data shows our economy and society have reopened successfully — and it is hugely encouraging this has happened without a resurgence in the virus.”WE all faced tough times during lockdown and only when it was right did Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the green light for our shops to reopen.But customers have stayed away in droves, leaving the retail landscape looking like a series of ghost towns.Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that around , people in England currently have the coronavirus — less than . per cent of a population of around million.And while our neighbours in Europe have flocked backed to their offices, we’ve been more wary over here.Around  per cent of French white-collar workers are back at their desks,  per cent of Italians and  per cent of Germans.Here, it is just  per cent.That has a knock-on for those city centre businesses that rely on those workers for trade, such as sandwich shops and dry cleaners. Not forgetting trains and buses that ferry workers around.Already the job losses are piling up, with Marks  Spencer announcing it is shedding , staff over the next three months.I fear it could get a lot worse with many more thousands of jobs lost across the High Street.Pre-Covid, there was the hustle and bustle of happy shoppers thronging the stores while office workers were spending in their breaks.It breaks my heart to know that shoppers are staying away in their millions and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, with countless businesses being brought to their knees.But it’s not just down to the public, we need action right from the very top of government.People need to have their confidence boosted, and while everyone appreciates we are in unprecedented times and it is tough, it is also the responsibility of the Government to show the way back, just like our counterparts have done in EuropeWe need support for entrepreneurs with low rents in new or abandoned units. And councils could use their compulsory purchase powers to turn empty buildings into places where businesses can thrive once more with good, safe public transport.Add to that safe cycling, rent “holidays” and flexible-term agreements to help get businesses back on their feet.So come on shoppers, shop and office workers, let’s get our High Streets and city centres buzzing again.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has scrapped caps on student numbers but many universities are still grappling with finding enough space for the number of kids who met the terms of their offers. Universities admissions body UCAS found that an extra , students now have the grades to get into their first choice uni.Ms Donelan said in a letter to vice-chancellors: “Where possible, try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year.”The failed algorithm for deciding A-level grades was ditched earlier this week in a massive Government U-turn, meaning more students met their university offers. But universities are concerned about litigious middle-class parents who might take up legal actiontheir kids dont get a place and have to take a gap year, according to The Times.Watchdog The Office for Students has backed the move to give priority to poorer school leavers. Chief exec Nicola Dandrige said:“While it is for universities to make inidual admissions decisions, students from disadvantaged backgrounds must not be allowed to slip through the net as admissions decisions are made.”But one admissions head has said universities may not follow the instruction, which does not set out how disadvantaged should be defined. There is a range of criteria normally relied on to decide who is from a deprived background - including those who lived in particular areas or attended schools where fewer people go onto higher education, as well as those from low-income families or ethnic minority backgrounds.The admissions head said: “In hard choices like these they would normally look at GCSE grades or parts of the personal statement. “I fear that many may already feel they have met their targets for disadvantaged children getting into university this year so have done enough.”Head of the Higher Education Policy Institute Nick Hillman, said it was not a simple decision. He said “If I was a vice-chancellor, or running admissions, I would worry that the wording is open to all sorts of challenges, even legal ones.“Do they have sufficiently robust information to make that fine judgment  Is it based on parents’ salaries, or ethnicity, or other characteristics  It is open to interpretation. How do you satisfy this without opening yourself up to potential legal challenges  No one is against giving an extra leg-up to people from very under-represented groups but there are a lot of litigious middle-class families out there and schools are very keen to ensure their progression rates are good this year.”Head of UCAS, Clare Marchant told BBC Radio  it was the right thing to do to prioritise poorer kids who are less likely to be able to take a gap year. She said: “I think it is absolutely the right intention. I think we know from all of our survey work that those from most disadvantaged backgrounds really, really worry about money. And sothey are deferred for a year, or asked to defer for a year, we’re likely to see a drop-off. And so that’s the real intent behind that.She added: “I think what I would say is that universities are very inidual, they make inidual decisions, but all of them, having spoke to a number of them at Universities UK over the course of the last days and weeks, are looking to be as super flexible — they want students to come to them.”The Office for Students is fighting off demands from campaigners that disadvantaged children should be given compensationthey have to take a gap year. Durham University has gone a step further to free up places and tried to convinced students to take a gap year by offering them a bursary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old left the body of her car entirely within the designated bay and paid for a ticket to go for a walk with her partner and three year old twins.But she was shocked when they ed to find a Penalty Charge Notice left on the dashboard.She took a series of pictures that showed her front right tyre had just crossed the line - and only because it was not straight on.And after sharing the images on social media, members of the public described it as the harshest parking ticket ever. Rebecca, a teaching assistant from Teignmouth, Devon, has now appealed the £ fine issued by Torbay Council and described it as crazy.She said: It is tricky to park there and the wheel has gone just about an inch over the line. If you get down on the floor then one edge of the tyre is slightly over, but the entire body of the car is within the bay.It just seems so ridiculous and very petty. It feels incredibly unfair.Mum-of-four Rebecca was with her partner Karl Linnell, , and twins Teddy and Peggy in Cockington, Devon, when she was issued the ticket at around .pm on Sunday.She said: We parked in the main car park right in the village. We managed to squeeze into a corner. When we got back we could not work out why we had got the ticket. We thought it must have been a mistake.I opened it up and read through and it is said we had not been within the parked bays. I looked around and could not believe it.Rebecca said the ticket was issued just minutes after their arrival and has launched an appeal - but has yet to get any response from the council.She added: We were going to go on and have a pub lunch but decided not to and went home. We have now contested it and are waiting for the outcome.Its an expensive ticket and when we shared it on Facebook other people were shocked and said we needed to fight it.I would like to find the warden and ask what was going through their mind. Did they genuinely think it was a fair ticket to issue If one of our wheels was entirely over the line then I could understand it, but this was only about an inch. It is really, really petty.A Torbay Council spokesperson said: When we receive a challenge to a penalty charge notice we need to investigate it fully, and therefore it would not be appropriate for us to comment further on the case at this stage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them. They added: For this reason, Sage does not have confidence that R is currently below  in England. We would expect to see this change in transmission reflected in the R and growth rate published over the next few weeks as we gain more certainty of what is currently happening.Meanwhile, experts have issued caution over the accuracy of the R rate estimate when cases are so few.Prof Keith Neal said that local Covid clusters can also push the R rate up for an entire region when it may just be one small area.The epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham said: “Making estimates of R with small number of cases becomes increasingly dficult and inaccurate.  Hence the wide range of the estimates.It comes as the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics published today suggests that new coronavirus infections have levelled off.An average of , people per day in private households in England were estimated to be newly infected with Covid- between August  and .This is lower than the previous estimate of , new infections per day for the period August  to .However the ONS said there is not yet enough evidence to say for definite that there has been a fall in new infections in the most recent week, and therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off.A Government spokesperson said: The very slight movement in the R number reinforces the importance for all of us of staying alert to control the virus and save lives.“But the number is an estimate with a high degree of uncertainty due to areas with lower case numbers or iabilities across the UK. It is only one indicator of how the UK is faring – ONS statistics also published today suggest that infections have levelled off.“We are in a far better position to deal with this virus than at the start of the pandemic but to continue to keep us all safe we must remember to wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance and get a testwe have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control.Earlier today, an intensive care specialist said that he is seeing fewer patients needing critical care for Covid-.Dr Ron Daniels, a consultant in the West Midlands, suggested it could be because those who are most vulnerable to the disease have already died, while a spike in Covid cases could be among young people going out more.He told BBC Radio s Today Programme: I think there are considerations around the positivity rates, but were not looking at the case fatality rates and we’re not looking at hospital admissions.Weve seen cases go up since the beginning of July, and still our hospitals are relatively empty of patients with this condition. We’re seeing very few patients admitted to hospital, let alone requiring intensive care.Experts say that the rise in the R rate is to be expected as the country eases out of lockdown - and warn that the virus is still spreading.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a mathematician at the University of Sussex, said: “The latest estimates of R number appear to indicate that in all regions of England, the estimates of R number have either remained the same or have grown in the space of one week. Most worrying about this is the possibility that in several regions, including London, South West and North West, the R number exceeds , suggesting a possibility of a substantial growth in new infections in these regions in the near future. With ONS data estimating around , new infections in England and Wales in the week - August, this means that the infection is still very prevalent across all of the UK, hence it is of paramount importance that people continue to follow the guidance on protection and social distancing to prevent major local outbreaks.The list is based on the percentage of the population with symptomatic Covid- from data submitted by more than . million app users in the UK.Here is this weeks full list...These latest figures were based on the data from , swab tests done between August  to August . Dr Michael Head, a senior researcher in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We are seeing increases in new daily cases, and now we have an R number estimate that is approximately at the . threshold. The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission. This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population.Suppressing COVID- is extremely dficult. We know that most cases are transmitted within the indoor environment.It’s currently August, and so outdoor meetings are possible, but as we head towards the winter, fewer people will be inclined to meet outside. That raises dficult questions about how best to handle social contacts across the winter months, particularly with the increased potential for transmission from younger populations, who usually have relatively mild cases, on to vulnerable populations where the consequences can be more serious.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was due to end in England and Wales on Monday. Mr Starmer welcomed the extension, but said it should be extended further.He said: The government’s eleventh hour u-turn on the evictions ban was necessary - but such a brief extension risks offering only short-lived relief to tenants.The ban must not be lted until the Government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home due to Covid. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has now confirmed the four-week extension. But Sir Terence Etherton, Master of the Rolls - Englandaposs second most senior judge - confirmed the extension in a letter this afternoon. He said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland had written to him yesterday to confirm the extension. He wrote: The CPRCmet earlier today. It considered the extremely unusual nature and timing of the letter of direction from the Lord Chancellor but by majority considered that it was bound to follow the direction. He aded: This -week extension to the stay relating to housing possession cases, will allow for further work to be done to prepare for the stay to be lted which in many respects can be welcomed. The Housing Law Practitioners Association also said it had been confirmed to them, tweeting: We have now had official confirmation that the stay on possession proceedings will be extended to  September. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hinted a u-turn was on the cards. He told LBC radio: I know that getting that balance right between the renters and the landlords is something that my colleagues in the housing ministry are working closely on, and I think they will make further announcements about it shortly, which Iaposm not privy to right now.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said:   “The government has today recognised the very real danger that tens of thousands of renters are in. It is right for the government not to lt the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. “The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters. People are still falling behind on their rent – , private tenants since March - leaving them vulnerable when the ban does end. And we all know even more economic storm clouds are gathering. “A bullet may have been dodged with this extension, but as soon as Parliament s, it must give judges extra powers to stop renters being evicted because of ‘Covid-arrears’.   Facing eviction this Christmas, is not a present anybody wants.” But the National Residential Landlords Association did not welcome the news.  Ben Beadle, CEO of the National Residential Landlords Association has said:“A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline.   “An enormous amount of work as gone into finding a balance between supporting tenants who have been affected by the pandemic and preventing signicant financial harm to landlords, in accordance with the Government’s promise. This announcement satisfies no-one.  “Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with signicant arrears unrelated to Covid-, antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make le miserable for their neighbours and housemates.   “Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure. There must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income.  “Only this will give both tenants and landlords security and reduce the risk of widespread tenancy failure.” "},{"url":null,"title":"michael goves department alone spent","story":"NewsMichael Goves department alone spent £m on consultants and marketing during Covid- crisisEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror found a string of government contracts signed by the Cabinet Office for \"consultancy services\", \"intelligence\" and \"media analysis\" related to the Covid- epidemic from May to August ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

This Sunday a policy comes into effect that could see tens of thousands of families kicked out of their one and only home. That is when the temporary ban on landlords evicting tenants comes to an end. Charities are warning that more than , renters are at risk of being made homeless in the run-up to winter as a result. Many have fallen behind with their rent simply because they were furloughed or lost their jobs during the pandemic. Evicting them will only worsen the housing crisis. Too many people are forced to live in sub-standard accommodation already. The number of children living in BBs or temporary shelter has hit a -year high. That figure is only going to rise unless the Communities Secretary changes his mind. Mr Jenrick needs to leave whichever one of his three ivory towers he is currently residing in and do the decent thing. He should extend the ban on evictions and come up with a plan to give people the safe and affordable housing they deserve.

Lulworth coastguard said the swimmer got into trouble in choppy seas at Durdle Door, Dorset, on Thursday afternoon. The man, believed to be in his s, apparently tried to swim back to the shore but was stopped by mph winds and enormous waves that rose well over his head. Another man who ran into the sea to try and help him also got into dficulty before dozens of people on the beach came to the rescue. More than  people linked arms to enter the sea and successfully brought the two men back to shore. They withstood being buffeted by the waves and an eye-witness said she feared for multiple casualties, but miraculously everyone emerged unscathed. Witness Emily Foote said: The foam was like a washing machine and at one point I thought we were going to end up with  casualties in the sea rather than just one.  With every attempt they got a little bit closer and were finally able to reach him. The whole beach applauded when the two men got back and they didnapost need any help from paramedics or anything like that. Iaposve never seen the beach like that and full credit has to go to everyone who risked their own lives to save the swimmer.  Jeanette Warren, from Portsmouth, Hants, said: He was confidently swimming for some time until an awful gust came and literally swept him so far out. He was actually very good, staying calm and then giving it his all to swim with the waves. A small crowd quickly became a very large crowd and people on land began to realise he was in distress. A statement by Lulworth Coastguard Rescue team said: With the large waves and spring tides of late, we strongly discourage sea swimming and playing around in the surf, especially on exposed beaches such as Durdle Door.

Sharon Goldie claimed Robyn Goldie was attention seeking despite the sick  year-old begging for help as she lay dying of a perforated ulcer. The shocking details of the abuse emerged as Goldie appeared at the High Court in Glasgow. It was revealed that Robyn had previously begged a neighbour for £ to get food. Robyn had also once been forced to call a gas company complaining of being cold. Robyn had lived with Goldie until she was four before moving in with her gran. She had earlier been put on the child protection register after Goldie was found to be drunk while supposedly caring for her daughter. This led to the child staying with her gran until  in what was described as a stable le. Robyn then ed to her mum in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, due to a number of reasons including starting secondary school. But, the court heard social workers continued to monitor the pair. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said: Goldie was offered - on ious occasions - the opportunity to attend parenting classes. She declined to attend. Goldieaposs drinking became an issue causing friction with her daughter. Miss Edwards: Goldie asked forto be removed from her care. Social workers visited the pair - often unannounced - with arguing between them described as common. The house was also said to be stinking of cat urine. The court heard how Robyn told a friend she did not like her mum drinking. It was at this time Goldie appeared to be a regular at the Melody Bar in Wishaw. Miss Edwards: Robyn was often seen attending there looking for Goldie and asking for money to buy food. She also often approached a neighbour asking for £ to get food. Robyn once said she had only had a yoghurt that day. The child was described as thin, dirty and unkempt.  Miss Edwards: On an occasion , Goldie was heard to say: aposI am f***ing sick of her. I wish she would go back and stay with her granapos. The court heard Robyn would also film Goldie - who slapped and bit her daughter - screaming at her. The child told friends how drunken Goldie would offer her cannabis and alcohol while constantly insisting she did not want her in the house. In March , Robyn was then found to have a rash caused by fleas. The week before her death, Robyn was given painkillers after complaining of a sore stomach and legs. Goldie pleaded guilty to a charge under the Children and Young Persons Act of wilfully ill-treating and neglecting Robyn, who died after suffering a burst stomach ulcer. The  year-old later found her daughter slumped on the sofa - but left to go out in the garden to have a drink with a friend. It was only after they eventually discovered Robyn was dead that an ambulance was finally called for. On July , Goldie then told staff at the Melody Bar she had locked her daughter in the house so she could not get out. The next day, Robyn complained to a friend she had been ill and not eaten for days. But, on July , Robyn texted her gran claiming she felt a lot better. However, a friend of Goldie saw the drained girl that day and told the mum: Sheaposs just not well. That night, Robyn told Goldie to get help as she had pain all over. Miss Edwards: She refused to contact an ambulance. Another friend of Goldie said he would go instead with Robyn in a taxi to hospital - but stopped him claiming the girl was attention seeking. The next day, Robyn begged a neighbour to get her an ambulance as she could not breathe. But, her mum yelled at her to get in. On July  - the day Robyn passed away - the court heard it is thought likely a stomach ulcer she had burst.

For Jo and her new husband Andy, it had been love at first sight and she admits everything happened really quickly. They moved in together soon after meeting  years ago and within six months Jo was pregnant with Poppy. Then, six years ago, the couple celebrated their dream wedding before jetting off to Alicante on a sun-soaked honeymoon. With them was their little daughter, Poppy, and Joaposs mum, who had come to celebrate and so the happy couple could have some alone time on this special holiday. But just a few days into their honeymoon, on July , Jo was mown down by a drink driver and left with devastating injuries. She and Andrew had gone out for the evening and were walking along a path when a car careered into her, with her new husband uninjured because he was just a few paces behind. Jo, from Wakefield in West Yorkshire, said: I was lying on the path and I thought I was going to die. I thought to myself, aposIaposve got married, Iaposve had my little girl, Iaposm fiishedapos. But then I made a deal with God. I swore I would do anything to survive, no matter what my injuries were. The crash had left the former beautician with a broken spine, four crushed vertebrae, five broken ribs and a cracked sternum. She was rushed to hospital in Spain where medics desperately tried to stabalise the young mum, who should have been on the holiday of a letime but was instead fighting for her le. Jo had to spend four weeks in hospital in Alicante before she was declared safe to travel because of fears about a blood clot close to her heart. She had to be flown home on a stretcher and after initially being treated in her local hospital, she had to be quickly transferred to Leeds General Infirmary because of complications. Jo recalls screaming in pain during her first days back in the country. Finally, after five weeks of hospital treatment, Jo was allowed tohome for the first time - but her le would never be the same again. She had to wear a brace at all times and the room where she had previously carried out beauty treatments was converted into her bedroom - it became her entire world. Unable to get out of the specially adapted bed, Jo had to rely on carers coming in to help her wash, change and even get out of bed four times a day. Beside her at all times was her devoted husband, Andrew, who was forced to give up his job at Warburtons so he could care for his badly injured we.  The driver who had ploughed into her was convicted of causing the accident and jailed for four months and one day. He has now passed away after serving his sentence. Finally on December , , Jo was allowed to take her brace off for the first time and she admits it was a terrying moment. She said: I was so scared because I thought my bones were going to collapse. I didnapost like to move. But the amazing thing was being able to get into the shower after all those months. I could wash my hair for myself and that was amazing, it really was the little things that made all the dference. But Jo also had a gruelling  months of rehab and physio to enable her to go back to something resembling a normal le. And ato her old le was impossible. Jo had been a successful beautician but because of the scale of her injuries, that was no longer possible. The -year-old said: I was working a lot of hours and I had to be fit and healthy to massage people and carry out the treatments, this just wasnapost something I could do after what happened. However, determined nothing would get in the way of her family le, Jo retrained and now works in marketing. Itaposs had the added advantage of enabling her to spend more time with Poppy, now , something she sees as a positive.Andrew, after leaving his job at Warburtons, is now a decorator and works for himself. However, the long-term impact of the crash has not only left Jo with mobility problems, she now also suffers from the debiliating condition, fibromyalgia, which leaves her in almost constant pain. The previously fit and healthy mum has also gained five stone after spending so long immobile and is still unable toto the gym. And, after years of battling to keep the home that she and her family live in and which she bought from her parents aged just , Jo has been forced to make another heartbreaking decision.The five-bedroom house is too much for her and Andrew to manage because of her condition and the family want to downsize. Jo and Andrew have come up with an ingenius plan to sell theyaposre home - and it could be yours for just £. Instead of selling through an estate agent, they are raffling the property, which comes with its own man cave, garden and all itaposs furnishings, which are worth around £,. The house itself has been valued at £,.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

Saaba Mahmood, , pocketed state benefit handouts on behalf of her aunt and uncle over a five-year period - even though she knew they were living in their native Pakistan. But when she was caught, Mahmood, of Heald Green near Stockport, Greater Manchester, said she did not realise she was unable to claim on the behalf of relatives who lived abroad. She also claimed she lacked skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult and added that she did not realise her offences were not victimless crimes. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Mahmood admitted four charges of failing to disclose information to make a gain and one offence of fraud but was given  months jail suspended for  months. Prosecutor Julian Goode said: These are cases relating to benefit claims on behalf of her aunt, uncle, and mother. She acted as an appointee for them and in that capacity and she had a duty to disclose changes in circumstances that would impact the claim. She claimed Disability Living Allowance on behalf of her aunt between January  and September , and Employment Support Allowance between February  and October . She was acting as her auntaposs appointee and as a result both benefits were paid directly into her bank account. There is evidence to show her aunt left the UK in January  to go to her daughteraposs wedding in Pakistan but fell ill there and did notto the UK until  October . The defendant did not disclose this and continued to receive those payments in her behalf between February  and October . These payments totalled £,.. Her uncle claimed Disability Living Allowance between November  and October  and Employment Support Allowance between October  and October . The defendant became his appointee in July . She got the credit into her bank account, but he was out of the country between November  and October  and again between October  and June  and June  and December . The defendant failed to report the change and the overpayment was £,.. The defendant became an appointee for her mother in July  and on  August  she said her mother was able to care for her uncle and received Employment Support Allowance. On  October  she reported the change that her mother had stopped caring for her uncle. The overpayment in this case was £. The total overpayment was £,.. The defendant was interviewed on  February last year and confirmed her aunt had been living in Pakistan between  and . She said she did not know she needed to reportsomeone was abroad. She said she had reported that her uncle was in Pakistan in September . She said she completed forms between June  and November  in which she failed to mention he was in Pakistan. A breach of trust was involved. At an earlier hearing a lawyer for Mahmood said she would benefit from programmes to help her understand these are not victimless offences. They added: She lacks skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult. At Thursdayaposs hearing in mitigation defence lawyer Isobel Thomas said: She is genuinely remorseful and has repeated this on a number of occasions to let the court know how sorry she is. She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Only one of the claims was fraudulent from the outset and that claim was worth £.  Immediate custody will have a signicant harmful impact on others. She has eight children aged between one and  who have to go into foster care as her husband has schizophrenia and is unable to care for them. Her youngest two children are very close to her and sleep by her. One of her daughters has been assaulted in the past and appeared as a witness at a Leeds Crown Court trial. She is nervous of men and other people. Her husband gets very distressed when she isnapost there and may have to go to hospitalshe were sent to prison. She is a carer for her aunt who has dementia, hepatitis C and kidney failure. She has never troubled the courts before and no longer claims benefits. She would comply with all requirements of a suspended sentence. Mahmood was also ordered to complete  rehabilitation requirement days and  hours of unpaid work."},{"url":null,"title":"new data shows surge new","story":"NewsCoronavirus surge in Swindon - new cases in week as Bury and Stoke infections on risePublic Health England data released today reveals  local authority areas have rates of  new cases per , or higher, with  showing an increase in seven daysShareCommentsByDave BurkeIan Jones:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The couple were spotted arriving at the castle ready for a relaxing countryside break with Eugenieaposs grandparents. Photos shared on social media show them looking happy and relaxed in casual outdoor wear, with Eugenie carrying a large orange box with a black bow. Both the Queen and Prince Philip celebrated birthdays in lockdown, so it may be a late present for their special day. The Monarch spends every summer at Balmoral, and dferent members of the family come to stay over the warmer months. Her youngest son Prince Edward and his family were among the first to visit, and were seen walking around the grounds with the Queen last week. He was joined by we Sophie and kids Louise and James, but there is a change that theyaposve now ed home as Louise picked up her GCSE results yesterday. In order to stick to social distancing rules, all royals visiting the Queen this summer will stay in separate accommodation this year rather then sleeping in the main house.  They will also make sure all their family activities are safe, and the visits are expected to feature lots of walks and outdoor time. The Queen and Philip ended months of lockdown in Windsor when they flew to Balmoral at the start of this month, and theyaposre expected to stay there until at least September. They were driven from Windsor to RAF Northolt in London this afternoon, where they then boarded a plane heading to the ,-acre Aberdeenshire estate.  The couple sat side by the side in the car, and the Queen had her trademark black handbag resting on her lap. They are joined in Scotland by whataposs been dubbed their aposBalmoral Bubbleapos, a small team of key staff who will look after them during their stay. It includes master of the household Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Queenaposs private secretary Sir Edward Young and Paul Whybrew and William Henderson, her pages. The Queen was living at Buckingham Palace when the pandemic began, but was whisked to Windsor before lockdown was introduced.Speaking at the time, a source said: She is in good health but it was thought best to move her. A lot of her staff are a bit panicky over coronavirus.“The Palace hosts a constant stream of visitors including politicians and dignitaries from around the world.

An outbreak linked to the Greencore Factory, which makes sandwiches for the upmarket retailer, will see staff and members of their households having to isolate for  days. The Department of Health said that local testing data and analysis from the Joint Biosecurity Centre had shown a spike in cases in the area to be almost solely down to the outbreak at the Northampton factory. The site employs , people and initially did not close its operations despite reporting dozens of cases. The department said: The factory will close voluntarily from today and employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks. The Health Secretary will introduce regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced. Anyone who leaves isolation prior to the two-week period ending without reasonable excuse will be subject to fines. The outbreak saw Northampton upgraded to an area of interventionapos due to the spike in infections. While Birmingham has a coronavirus infection rate of . per , people, Northamptonaposs rate is far higher at . as it is a much smaller place. In all intervention areas bar Northampton, possibly because the outbreak is so localised, restrictions have been imposed, while enhanced support zone councils have received more backing and mobile testing units have been dispatched. The Department of Health said Health Secretary Matt Hancock would bring in regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced and warned that anyone who does not abide by the rules without a reasonable excuse could be fined. Director of Public Health Northamptonshire, Lucy Wightman, told the BBC: The factory will close voluntarily. Most employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks.  Northamptonaposs incidence rate has hit . per , people, in the week ending  August. Mrs Wightman said the current situation is fragile in the East Midlands town. She said: If we donapost keep continuing to work together to reduce the transmission of the virus there is a very real possibility that further and stricter intervention measures and a possible local lockdown will follow. A message sent to staff at Greencore, and shared with the BBC, states the company has decided to put all colleagues working at the Northampton siteon a period of  days self-isolation.  It adds: We know this will come as concerning news for all our colleagues. We will therefore send further updates to you on the action you need to take shortly. Please stay safe. A spokesman for Greencore said the company had taken the decision to temporarily cease production at its Northampton facility from the end of today as a result of the ongoing COVID- outbreak in the Northampton area and at the site. This decision will allow all remaining colleagues at the site to self-isolate as a precautionary measure, and has been taken as part of the regionaposs ongoing efforts to reduce the spread of the virus and keep our colleagues safe.

The TV survival legend has agreed to spearhead a new drive to get hundreds more female recruits to become frontline troops in just a few months time. Grylls, , has secretly agreed his organisation British Military Fitness will join up with recruiting giant Capita to improve applicants’ fitness levels. Capita has hit recruitment targets over the past two years, but wants to help the MoD create a more gender-inclusive Army. It follows a high drop off rate in female recruits applying to join up and then either falling short on fitness or not going to basic training for other reasons. As much as  per cent of all candidates signing up to join the Army are females, after new gender inclusion rules now mean women can fight alongside male soldiers. But as many as  per cent of them have fallen slightly short on strict fitness tests which are just as gruelling as those undertaken by male candidates. This comes despite Army commanders noticing that females who do join the Army very often out -perform their male colleagues in toughness. Bear Grylls – joint owner and figurehead of BMF - told the Daily Mirror exclusively: “British Military Fitness has the military expertise, nationwide reach and a community fitness for all philosophy that ideally positions us to support Capita and the Army. “The goal is simple: to improve physical performance and readiness of potential recruits. “Our instructors and members come from a broad range of backgrounds which enables us to provide anyone who wishes to join the Army with the best possible chance of passing the Armyaposs entry standards. “Weaposre hugely proud to be part of this initiative and in collaboration with the Army and Capita we look forward to making a positive impact to our Armed Forces. “Women have proved to be some of the best recruits weaposve had lately in the Army and have proved time and time again to be just as strong as men.” "},{"url":null,"title":"should children heading back school","story":"NewsShould children be heading back to school  Tell us how you feelBoris Johnson has pledged to reopen schools in England in the coming weeks - but some parents and teachers have voiced concerns over the plansShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsSchools have promised to make teaching environments safe \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The couple wore face masks as they joined other volunteers at charity BabyBaby, which provides basic necessities for families in need. Pictures show the couple handing supplies to people through car windows at Dr Owen Lloyd Knox Elementary School in South LA on Wednesday. Both looked casual, with Meghan wearing loose khaki shorts and a white shirt while Harry opted for brown shorts, a white polo shirt and a baseball cap. A source told Town  Country: “Everyone was in great spirits. The kids were eager to receive their books and supplies and Meghan and Harry did what they do best - engage and connect with the crowd.” Meghan and Harry also chatted to parents and children who looked to see the special royal guests.  The volunteering comes after it emerged the couple have bought a £million mansion in the celebrity hotspot of Santa Barbara. They moved out of movie producer Tyler Perryaposs LA house in July, buying the nine-bed property after taking out a £.m mortgage and getting some financial help from Prince Charles.The couple had been house-hunting for some time after relocating to the US from Canada just before the coronavirus lockdown.

She told fellow American womenyou are complacent, youaposre complicit during her video message, and described voting as being part of a legacy. The former US First Ladyaposs organisation aims to increase participation in elections and to close the race and age voting gap by changing the culture around voting. Speaking from her LA home, Meghan said: We can make a dference in this election and we will make the dference in this election. I think itaposs an exciting day, because it is the countdown to the change that we would all like to see for the better for our country. She went on to say: As we look at things today, though it had taken decades longer for women of colour to get the right to vote, even today we are watching so many women in dferent communities, who are marginalised, still struggling to see that right come to fruition, and that is - itaposs just simply not okay. And we look at the attempts of voter suppression and what thataposs doing, all the more reason we need each of you to be out there supporting each other to understand that this fight is worth fighting and we all have to be out there mobilising to have our voices heard. I think we are obviously faced with a lot of problems in our world right now, both in the physical world and in the digital world, but we can and must do everything we can to ensure all women have their voices heard.

The tragedy occurred after Ireland was battered by mph winds and heavy rain from Storm Ellen, which damaged buildings, uprooted trees and caused flooding, and a local councillor said extreme weather conditions may have been a factor. After her -year-old husband John, six-year-old daughter Amelia and -year-old son Thomas were killed, the heartbroken woman prayed with a priest and went round thanking emergency services members.

Fr John Farren, parish priest of Iskaheen, described it as a traumatic scene.He told the BBC: Itaposs a terribly tragic incident, itaposs just beyond words.He prayed with the mum at the crash scene, where she was hysterical from grief. He added: She was completely shocked... totally distressed, and I was with her when we prayed with the three deceased. Mrs Mullan climbed out of the car and was standing on the overturned wreckage when she was rescued. Her children also managed to get out of the car, but they later died. Before Mrs Mullan was taken to hospital, she went round thanking rescuers for their efforts.

The family are from the Moville area. They were ing home from a day out in Derry. A garda spokesperson said the driver lost control and the vehicle plunged down an embankment into around .pm on Thursday. The dad was driving the car and the children were in the back seat. The mum was in the front passenger seat.Local councillor Terry Crossan, who lives in the area, told the Derry Journal that a combination of heavy rain, high winds and a high tide may have been a factor in the tragedy.He said: Itaposs a very dark day for Inishowen. Our thoughts and prayers in the first instance have to go to the we and mother of the children and to their extended family who now have to go though this grief and bury their husband and children. Itaposs horrendous.The Sinn Fein councillor added: There was very, very inclement weather at that particular time. There was very heavy rain, fairly high winds, compounded by the fact that there was an extremely high tide.He was told that waves were breaking over the sea wall onto the road. Garda Superintendent Eugene McGovern said conditions were poor and the night was wet and windy, the Irish Mirror reported.  He said the stretch of road had recently been resurfaced and officers will probe whether it may have contributed to the tragedy. He added: We knew fairly early on that we were dealing with a family situation here and it was very dficult. We still donapost know what caused Mr Mullan to veer off the road but we will carry out a full investigation into all the circumstances. It was a wet and windy night and the stretch of road where the crash happened had recently been resurfaced so that will form part of our investigation. The deaths of the dad and two children are a blow to the area, Superintendent McGovern said.

But the health chief has called on the world to unite as success depends on finding a vaccine.The Ethiopian biologist and WHO official told a briefing in Geneva: And in our situation now with more technology, and of course with more connectiveness, the virus has a better chance of spreading, it can move fast because we are more connected now. But at the same time we have also the technology to stop it and the knowledge to stop it. So we have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness but an advantage of better technology. So we hope to finish this pandemicless than two years. He urged national unity and global solidarity.That is really key with utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccine.  More than . million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and , have died, according to Reuters.Some scientists have suggested coronavirus could follow a similar pattern to the deadly Spanish flu, which swept the globe in three waves, claiming about  millions lives.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people.  The president elect of the Royal Society of Medicine Professor Roger Kirby said in July: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming. What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds. Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu. Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, said in July that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves.But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young.  In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. While some countries have managed to reduce transmission of COVID-, Dr Tedros today warned that progress does not mean victory. He referenced several countries which had experienced new outbreaks, saying: These countries are a cautionary tale for those that are now seeing a downward trend in cases.” Much more research is needed on the impact of mutations in the coronavirus, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today. She said: A special working group has been formed to identy mutations ... and weaposre looking at how we can better understand what the mutation means and how they behave.

Then, the day before, we had to train indoors because the undersoil heating hadn’t been switched on and I ended up breaking my leg.“I had been so high and was then so low.“My debut turned out to be against Dundee away.“I had been on the bench before and people had been saying: ‘You are going to get your debut.’#I thought: ‘Oh no, don’t say that because I will be a nervous wreck.’“I was just a wee, skinny boy“Then I got the call and we were winning - at the time.“There was then a counter-attack and they scored to make it -.

It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.”Championship-winning defender Dave Rogers says departing Dundee in  for Ayr United was one of his biggest regrets of his career.The bubbly Scouser arrived at Dens Park ahead of the   season and played  times as the Dark Blues won promotion back to the big time and lted the First Division trophy.He would leave the following year, however, after an injury-hit campaign in the top flight.And the former centre-back revealed to the Walking Down The Provie Road podcast that the decision to join the Honest Men was a poor one.Rogers said: “I was offered a new contract by Dundee but I was misinformed and badly advised to go back and sign for Ayr United. I take a lot of blame myself as well.“But when I look back, it was the biggest mistake because I loved the city, loved the fans. It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.“Ayr wanted to make me captain, be their leader and get promoted, like Dundee just got promoted.“There was talk of a new stadium so there was a three-year contract with this leadership role and ambitions to get up but I was very naïve.“I listened to the wrong information and in hindsight it turned out to be the wrong decision. I don’t blame anybody, I take responsibility.”Now head coach at an ambitious American side FC Arizona, Rogers would only play  times for Ayr in Division One before a spell on loan at Partick Thistle in Division Two followed.The former Everton kid would go on to have a successful time in Ireland, winning three league titles with Shelbourne.But it’s his time at Dens Park as a -year-old he looks back on with most fondness.He said: “You’d be driving and stop at traffic lights and hear a horn go. It would be Dundee fans, showing their tattoos and everything. I love that. That’s passion. Genuine fans.“It was so rewarding to win the First Division that season and I’ll never forget the following we had at Raith Rovers that day. That’s why Dundee is still in my heart and always will be.“I look back on it and it was the best decision I made . What a squad of players and what a club to come and play for.”Described as a Dundee cult hero in some quarters, Rogers rejects that tag, saying there are more deserving ‘heroes’ for fans at Dens Park.“I’m a modest guy, I’m no cult hero for Dundee,” he added.“Bobby Cox was a legend and a hero. I remember when I signed the great man came along to training one day. Bobby came over to shake my hand and it sticks with me.“He said ‘Scouse! Welcome to the club, mate, great to have you!’ then he added ‘but you’ll never have a left foot as good as mine!’“To hear that from an actual legend, to make me feel welcome the way he did and the way everyone did, it’ll live with me forever.”And seeing the fans flock to Stark’s Park on April , , where Dundee only needed a point to clinch the First Division title with four games to spare, was one of Rogers’ best recollections in a memorable time at Dens Park.“We knew we had a squad of players capable of winning the league,” he added.“We knew the expectations, the fans and the club needed to be back in the Premier League. We knew we had what it took but we never let ourselves get carried away.“We got to Raith Rovers and only needed a point – I think the celebrations went on for four days after that! It was phenomenal and great memories.“We saw the support that day and were thinking to ourselves ‘let’s put it to bed, do it today’ after seeing the support behind the goal.“We got the point and sent everybody back over the Tay Bridge celebrating. It was an unbelievable experience.”Rogers found the net just once in his time in dark blue but he admits the penalty to win against Airdrie in October proved costly – and not just because he did his hamstring.“There was a little bit of rivalry between Airdrie and ourselves.“We got the penalty in the rd minute, I slotted it in and went running round the dog track towards all the fans and my hamstring went!“To kill a bit of time, Cowboytook me off. Walking past their bench, there was a bit of mouthing and me, being a Scouser, mouthed back at them.“In the altercation, I tripped over by accident and after the game I naively said Big Doddystuck his leg out and tried to trip me up.“It was tongue-in-cheek but the next day I’m all over the back of the newspapers! Alex McDonald was brilliant, he accepted my apology.“It was a lesson learned – keep the mouth shut next time and you won’t be fined four weeks wages!”Despite a change of manager from McCormack to Jocky Scott, the camaraderie among the players that season drove the club on.Rogers said: “The team spirit was phenomenal. It’s the best club, the best team spirit and the best squad of players I’ve ever been involved with.“I’ll never forget when big Rab Douglas signed – I thought we’d signed Ivan Drago from Rocky!“Rab was a phenomenal goalkeeper, his shot-stopping was amazing and to have a presence like that behind you as a defender is a relief at times.“You knowyou are under the cosh, the big fella was there.“You had Barry Smith, a great leader, and Brian Irvine at the back, Maddygetting up and down the left and not to forget the Cobra, the mad fellaAdamczuk would catch pigeons up and down the right-hand side.“Then there was Iain Anderson, a game-changer, Darren Magee in midfield with Jimmy McInally and Eddie Annand. We had a quality squad.”Now a highly-qualied coach, Rogers has travelled the globe since his playing days ended in , having coached in the Liverpool International Football Academy in Europe, India and South Korea as well as being assistant manager to the Indian national side.Now in Arizona, the -year-old is keen to continue learning his trade and has ambitions to manage back in the UK.Asked whether that might be at Dundee, Rogers replied: “Never say never! The manager James McPake is doing a great job and I hope the fans get behind him.“It’s tough times and like what happened with Barry Smith, I know the fans will get behind him.“One day I do have aspirations of being manager at highest level.“Would I love to come back to Scotland or the UK as a manager  Absolutely, but only for the right club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We are therefore taking the precaution at this time of advising that all staff self isolate for  days from the date they were last on site.“Additionally, we ask all pupils and their households to self isolate for  days from Thursday, August .

That can only lie in independence. It cannot lie in dependence upon the UK, particularly not upon on this hard-right government.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He did that.The players have been sanctioned with fines by the club and are awaiting the outcome of a disciplinary hearing next Friday having been served with notices of complaint by the SFA. They could yet be hammered by the SFA with bans of two to eight games.There is no point punishing the club and supporters by dropping them in a game where Aberdeen desperately needed to secure the first points of the season.New signing Ross McCrorie showed his versatility on the right of a back three.The -year-old played at right-back on loan at Portsmouth last season.Prior to that he played in Rangers’ first team in central midfield.This was McCrorie’s first game since the play-off semi-final with Portsmouth on July . There were no signs of ring rust.It was a solid debut in defence, where he was composed and cool in and out of possession.Similarly impressive was new signing Tommie Hoban, who made a welcometo the Dons starting line-up after  months of injury hell.Hoban played on the left of the back three.This was the former Watford defender’s first competitive game time since suffering cruciate ligament damage while on loan at Aberdeen against St Mirren in February .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

and even whole schools having to self-isolate.Face coverings could become mandatory in secondary schoolsA public health expert has since said that the mandatory wearing of masks in workplaces and secondary schools should be considered to keep them open.Coverings are compulsory in many indoor settings including shops, on public transport and in places such as cinemas, galleries, museums, libraries and banks.Professor Linda Bauld said they could be considered in other settingslevels of coronavirus go up.What did she say Asked in an interview on BBC Radio Scotland whether introducing face coverings in workplaces should be considered to allow more people to get back to work, she said: ldquoI donrsquot think we should rule it out.\"I thinkcases go up and we need particular settings to reopen that canrsquot, for whatever reason, face coverings indoors absolutely, but at the moment those sectors that can work from home ndash thatrsquos the message that I agree with ndash should continue to do that.Prof Bauld, who is professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the virus is at a ldquovery low level in terms of where we are in Scotland and that while it is circulating it is localised in terms of the rise in cases.Face coverings are already mandatory in some situationsShe said the best way to protect schools is to keep virus levels low, but that face coverings could be considered for secondary school pupils to avoid having to pause education.Prof Bauld said: ldquoIn terms of the cases that wersquore hearing about in school pupils, these are not cases that are occurring because pupils are catching the virus in the school setting, they are cases that are arising in the community, and when we have the virus circulating in the community even at low levels we know that children and young people may get it and then thereforethey go into the school they are still carrying it.She added: ldquoI thinkwe wanted to talk about, for example, face coverings for secondary school pupils rather than closing a school, thatrsquos another step we might want to discuss, thatrsquos being discussed in other places, but we donrsquot need it at the moment.\"We just have to think about what are the alternatives to having to pause education again because wersquore all trying to avoid that.Itrsquos now mandatory to wear a face covering in more

redundancy talks were being held and pointed to the devastating impact of Covid- on the industry and Musselburghrsquos operations.However, GMB Scotland, which oversaw negotiations with East Lothian Council and Chester when the local authority brought them in to operate the racecourse, said it believed more options should have been considered.And it questioned how the award-winning course could keep up standardsthe workers involved were reduced so drastically.Benny Rankin, GMB Scotland organiser, said: ldquoWe are doing all we can to assist our members affected by these redundancies but there is no denying itrsquos a worrying indication for the future of this historic racecourse.ldquoWe believe that Chester havenrsquot explored all possible options to protect the employment of the existing workforce, including the use of the Government furlough scheme until its deadline, and this looks like the easy option rather than the right thing to do for the long-term.ldquoWe struggle to see how Musselburghrsquos five-star status can be sustainedsome of the workers who help make it what it is are losing their livelihoods, and it poses questions of the Chester management over their vision for the future of this course.Musselburgh Racecourse was run jointly by East Lothian Council and Lothians Racing Syndicate for more than a decade under the Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee.However, issues within the committee led to the British Horseracing Authority demanding an independent inquiry into its governance, which revealed a toxic relationship had developed between the two parties.The council set up Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash a new governance body ndash to oversee it as it sought a third-party operator to take over the management of the course.Staff at the racecourse at that point became council employees.When Chester took over on June , they transferred to the company.Mr Farnsworth said that the course finances had been hit by lockdown and, even when racing resumed behind closed doors, it was with no spectators or hospitality.He said: ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on the details but, like every racecourse in the country, we are having to review operational costs across the business in light of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThe reality is that since we resumed racing behind closed doors on June , we are a racecourse which is now racing again but without spectators, without hospitality revenues and with reduced sponsorship and media rights income.ldquoThe racecourse is unable to carry on as

councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo.

Baa-lambs wonrsquot ever hurt us, will they Isla and George French from Cornhill, Aberdeenshire, one of six families featured in the series, clearly missed the memo about sticking with what you know, animal-wise. They had opted for emus, ostriches, deer, and, just for old timersquos sake, some belted Galloway cows.Oh, and they had three children under five and dad worked full-time as well as helping on the farm. Whatever  it was, this farming le was not for slackers.Now in its fourth series, This Farming Le keeps things simple, following families through a single year. The viewer has the advantage in that they know what is coming. The new series, beautully shot as ever, started in autumn  and everyone was worried about the looming Brexit. Little did they know something far worse than added bureaucracy was coming down the pipe.In Armadale, Joyce Campbell was concerned what price she would get for her lambs at market. She needed pound, and in the end made pound,. The scenes at auction, and at the market in Aberdeen where Isla and George French set up shop to sell their meat, were a reminder that farming is a business like any other and farms are not petting zoos.There were, however, clear bonds between the farmers and their animals. It was sad to see the animals go, said Joycersquos nephew, but there was the money to look forward to. ldquoDetermines how good a Christmas present Irsquom going to get. Joyce admitted to having a lump in her throat when the lambs went. ldquoYou wouldnrsquot be humanyou didnrsquot.The other two families introduced last night were hill farmers from the Lake District , and a couple with a baby from Morpeth, Northumberland.The latter had cows but their real money was made from breeding and training collies. One dog sold recently for close to pound,.Everything came down to money in the end. As the year rolls on and You Know What arrives, that will become even more so.For now, as the farmers headed into winter, the tone was hopeful, plans were being made to move to bigger, better premises, and branch out into this or that new scheme. But there will be no escaping the bleak times to come.All the more reason to enjoy what was happening now. One of Isla Frenchrsquos many jobs was watching over ostrich chicks while they hatched. When one beak pierced a shell she jumped, thinking someone had fired a bullet.She was worried about one that was taking too long to emerge. A lack of oxygen does for most chicks. She had a peer inside and spoke words of encouragement.ldquoKeep chipping away little chicks, she told the trio, ldquothatrsquos what lersquos about. It was quietly magical, miraculous even.

Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney You get where Irsquom going with this, donrsquot you  The answer to all the questions is: it doesnrsquot matter because they are interchangeable. On the question of the initial results, both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson defended them at first. Ms Sturgeon said they were ldquocredible Mr Johnson said they were ldquorobust.This was then followed by remarkably similar protests from pupils. In Scotland, they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode. In England they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode.Then came the apologies. Mr Swinney said: ldquoWe now accept that the risk of undermining the value of qualications is outweighed by a concern that young people, particularly from working class backgrounds, may lose faith in education. Mr Williamson said: ldquoIt became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadnt got the grade they truly deserved.\"Some people say the two situations are dferent they say the UK Government should have seen what was coming because of the fiasco in Scotland and I understand that to an extent. But to suggest that the Scottish Government handled the situation well and the UK Governmentrsquos approach was chaos is misleading. Look at the trajectories Irsquove outlined above: theyrsquore the same.The dference is our reaction. When the fiasco first hit in England and the Tories stood by the exam results, I was texted by a colleague of mine who insisted on voting Yes in  despite me telling him not to. His text contrasted the responses of the Tories and the SNP. The SNP, he said, admitted they screwed up, whereas the Tories dug their heels in. There was similar reaction on Twitter: ldquoat least the SNP had the grace to accept they were wrong and apologise.So when the Tories also apologised I texted my colleague back. Presumably, I asked him pompously, you now have the same respect for the Tory U-turn as you had for the SNP one  ldquoBetter late than never, he replied. ldquoBut they dragged their feet for days hellip and its yet another U-turn. They are very good at them, arent they I know a lot of you will agree with my colleague, but itrsquos me whorsquos writing this column, not him, so I get the last word and itrsquos this: the Tory apology in England reveals how biased we are in Scotland. If we trust someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland trust the SNP ndashwersquore willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and accept their apology. Equally,we do not like someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland do not like the Tories ndash wersquore more likely to judge them and dismiss their apology as too little too late.The word for all of this is bias and thatrsquos fine in a way because wersquore all guilty of it ndash we are all more likely to react to people rather than facts. But bias operates even when the facts are the same: I refer you the facts outlined above ndash they are the same. Some people may say the bias towards the SNP is well founded: theyrsquove governed Scotland well. They may also say the bias against the Tories is well-founded: look at their record.

The leader of its family policy unit is Cristina Odone, former editor of The Catholic Herald. As such its , among others, is to shore up classic Conservative family values, at the heart of which is marriage. Sadly, the present Prime Minister seems not to have received the memo.Setting aside for the moment the religious and political leanings of those behind this report, its conclusions show the stark and widening gulf between the married well-off and the unmarried poor. Medicine has long recognised the advantages ndash especially to men ndash of tying the knot, but the CSJrsquos findings focus on the enormous benefit that marriage bestows not on the couple, but on their children.Despite being lauded by David Cameron as ldquoa great institution, few subjects have been more ripe for ridicule. The butt of stand-ups down the ages, matrimony is the gag that never stops giving. It can be plumbed endlessly for laughs by the cynical, the wry, the embittered and the romantic. Yet the conclusions of the Centre for Social Justicersquos report are anything but funny.Their statistics show that those on low incomes are far less keen to wed than the wealthy. Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light. And it gets worse. The middle classes are not only more likely to marry, but % of high earners do so, compared to % of the poorest. If a straight line can be drawn between cohabitation and unstable family relationships, that is bad news for youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade. When finally it became commonplace society grew more civilised, acknowledging that couples didnrsquot require an official document to take themselves, and be taken, seriously. Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation. Those who are strapped for cash either consider it irrelevant, or not for the likes of them. And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding. The status of the couple and their families is proclaimed by the nature of the ceremony, the wedding venue, and the sumptuousness of the reception. Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office. The seriousness of the bond lies in the couplersquos decision to commit to each other, not in any of the hoopla that follows. Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Tory commentators and many MPs are deeply dischuffed with Mr Johnson, and not just because his Government made an even worse cock-up of the exams than the Scottish Government. Negotiations resumed this week over the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and it is safe to say that expectations among the Conservative faithful are not high.Indeed, Brexiter Tory MPs, like Iain Duncan Smith, fully expect a sell-out. They think Mr Johnson is preparing to accept a whole range of EU regulations even after we have left. This means no trade deals with free market America, no state aid to key industries, no low tax havens and a ldquobetrayal of fishing.Tory MPs hoped that Boris would be tough on immigration, would cut taxes and rein back bureaucracy, while tackling political correctness and the nanny state. What they got was a bicycling PM who seems to be tough on motorists, not illegals. He has adopted what the Spectator columnist Christopher Snowden, calls ldquopurse-lipped, micro-managing, finger-wagging, lemon-sucking, censorious, anti-business, killjoy policies like the campaigns on obesity and sugar.Not in their wildest dreams did true blue Tories expect their chosen one to increase public spending by more than any Labour government since . Yet, this Government is currently paying the wages of half the working population through furlough, benefits and public sector employment. UK debt is now pound trillion. Thank God Margaret Thatcher is not alive to see it.Mr Johnson hasnrsquot even delivered on scrapping HS, the fast rail line that most Tory MPs think is a white elephant. Instead, he is fantasising about building bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Yet that is not going to keep the Union together. His Brexit deal, it is now clear, has created a gulf between the UK and Northern Ireland.The province has remained in regulatory alignment with the European Unionrsquos single market, which means that there must be the very border checks the PM promised would never happen. Worse, it has handed the SNP a genuine grievance: being denied access to markets with which Northern Ireland can trade seamlessly.Tories are appalled by Mr Johnsonrsquos lack of urgency on Scotland as support for independence grows. The former Tory leader, William Hague, said this week thatthe PM doesnrsquot get his act together the UK will be finished within five years. Tories like Mr Hague think he allowed Nicola Sturgeon to play politics with the coronavirus.What they didnrsquot anticipate was the cack-handed and contradictory approach taken by the UK Government. At first, the lockdown seemed to appeal to the British wartime spirit, which always goes down well on the Right. But far from winning a victory over this viral enemy, Britain has recorded the worst excess death rate in Europe and now the deepest recession.Most Conservatives loath the imposition of masks, which the Daily Mail commentator, Peter Hitchens, calls ldquomuzzles, and which libertarians think are pointless impediments. Many Tory voters spend their holidays in France and the letters columns are full of people complaining about being forced back to Blighty even from regions of France where Covid is almost non-existent.Yet this Conservative Government kept Britainrsquos airports open during the worst phase of the pandemic, allowing  million travellers to come to Britain largely unchecked, including a number from Covid hot spots like Italy and China. And donrsquot even mention track and trace.The exams debacle was the final straw. Tory MPs want the head of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a plate for his chaotic U-turn, but the real criticism is of the Prime Minister. He should surely have seen this coming after the chaos in Scotland. It seems to many asMr Johnson isnrsquot really in charge.His presentation has been lamentable, and even is greatest fans are disappointed with his bumbling delivery and lack of grip. He was never a detail man, and everyone knew he flew by the seat of his pants ndash thatrsquos when he managed to keep them on.Conservatives are pretty forgiving to politicians who think like they do, have the same instincts on nation and values. What is especially damaging is a growing sense that Mr Johnson is just not really a Conservative at all. They expected him to take a tough line with the statue topplers and culture warriors of Black Lives Matters. But instead of banging heads, he avoided confrontation and made only a routine condemnation of vandalism. He allowed Winston Churchill himself to be boxed up in Parliament Square. How could it come to this Part of the problem, I think, is that many Conservatives believed what Labour said about Mr Johnson ndash that he was a bit of a racist, misogynist, homophobic right winger. The most ldquoright-wing prime minister in British history as Labourrsquos John Mc Donnell called him. This he never was.Colourful phrases about Burqa-wearers looking like letter boxes does not a white supremacist make. When he was London mayor, he was careful to keep the black and ethnic community onside and he used to lead LGBT marches wearing a pink stetson. When he became PM he installed more BAME ministers than all previous UK governments combined. You wont hear Mr Johnson using Daily Mail rhetoric about immigrants, he genuinely believes in state intervention and he is quietly a bit of a Europhile. Far from being a free market ideologue, Boris Johnson is a liberal, patrician Tory ndash more like Michael Heseltine, Brexit aside, than Margaret Thatcher.The final insult was this Tory Prime Minister ennobling Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist who used to support the objectives of the IRA. That was the final straw.

Journalists attending could not see them. In a trial, hearing is not the same thing as hearing and seeing. The jury could hear and see them under cross-examination when the defence sought to test their credibility. It was from that unique position that the jury , with a majority of women on it, decided  times that Mr Salmond should be acquitted.There is an aspect of the trial proceedings that is troubling, and raises the question that while the trial itself was fair, was it the fairest Mr Salmond was entitled to  The result of two preliminary hearings prohibited his defence from advancing, in the trial, evidence of a conspiracy, forcing his defence counsel to go as near as he dare on those grounds, by using the euphemism ldquoit stinks. I am, of course, not aware of whether the jury agreed that the case against him stank, nor am I aware of whether the jury accepted Mr Salmondrsquos own evidence when he described the allegations against him by certain women from within the nationalist movement as ldquofabrications. But the jury obviously believed part or whole of the defence case, and or disbelieved part or whole of the prosecution witnesses, to reach its verdict. It is a matter for regret, and shame on some, that attempts to re-trial Alex Salmond continue.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.HAVING watched BBCrsquos recent offering, The Trial of Alex Salmond, and read Alison Rowatrsquos subsequent review TV account of Salmond trial  Guilty of unfairness, The Herald, August  her analysis exposes the programmersquos many weaknesses.In the absence of a silver bullet, the production took aim with a scattergun, original facts and fresh revelations in short supply, preferring comment   opinion   speculation from senior BBC journalists seemingly hunting as a pack.The editorial brief appeared a crude attempt to recreate the trial   outcome programme commissioners had wished foraccurate, thatrsquos shameful, deceitful and duplicitous, BBC News yet again peddling a heavily distorted Scottish perspective.Overpopulated with a blizzard of talking heads, many with a distinctly tangential connection with the case, some with axes to grind, quantity took precedence over quality.Meanwhile, several BBC journalists, led by the hitherto irreproachable Kirsty Wark, whose husband, Alan Clements is a director of the loss-making Two Rivers production company ndash less than two years old yet commissioned to make this potentially important film ndash appeared to dispense with any semblance of balance, fairness, transparency or editorial integrity.BBC News Scotland Editor Sarah Smith even ventured during what was quite probably a licence-fee funded mid-trial lunch that Mr Salmond was ldquoa really diminished figure, % personal observation   interpretation, based on what information, source or qualied knowledge Sadly, the programme represented a genre no longer entirely unexpected from the national broadcaster we are all obligated to pay for in fact, such unsubtle content has become the corporationrsquos stock-in-trade in Scotland, seemingly in step with Londonrsquos increasingly worried power brokers and not what now appears to be a majority of its Scottish financiers.For Ms Wark, that her plaintive cry from the media scrum as the former first minister ended his pre-prepared statement, ldquoAlex Salmond, Alex Salmond, Kirsty Wark, BBC, went ignored and unanswered, was telling neither name now carries the weight and respect they once might have and programmes like this simply accelerate that downward trend.Mike Wilson, Longniddry.I AM rather surprised that Peter Russellconsiders Kenny MacAskillrsquos allegations of ldquoconspiracy during The Trial of Alex Salmond should be ldquoinvestigated as a matter of urgency by the Crown authorities, andthey are found to be of substance, the alleged perpetrators must be charged and put on trial accordingly. Conspiracy, as I am sure Mr Russell is well aware, would only come to the attention of the Crown authoritiesthe conspiracyrsquos purpose was unlawful . Political plottingis pretty much core to almost any political party. As, I believe, a long-time member of the Labour Party, I would be surprisedMr Russell was not familiarin such machinations.The charges against Alex Salmond were though a first-class opportunity for the Unionist parties to seek to make political capital against not just Mr Salmond, but the First Minister too, the SNP and indeed the entire independence movement. However, as Isobel Lindsay points out in her excellent letter , ldquothe problem was that the script got messed up in the middle of the project. The pesky jury, which had a majority of women, had undermined their plan by daring to find Mr Salmond not guilty.Hence we can expect any opportunity to rescue some political capital from this major disappointment for the Unionist faction will be taken, though not from anything to do with appropriate and respectable behaviour, but from pure political expedience and opportunism, which like ldquoconspiracy is core to the political trade.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.CLEARLY Iain Gunnhas been totally duped by Nicola Sturgeonrsquos foolish, theoretical concept for the success of an independent Scotland.

But hold on! Is this really because they are women  Irsquom not a massive fan of generalisations because they lead to stereotypes. I mean, Irsquom a woman who takes an hour to decide what to watch on Netflix, who stares in food-envy at fellow-dinersrsquo meal choices in restaurants, and who, more than once, has been told to remove my rose-tinted specs.Whilst it does look as though countries with female leaders, on the whole, were quicker to lock-down and have been more risk averse when it comes to peoplersquos lives ndash Germany, New Zealand, and Taiwan come to mind as having had far fewer Covid deaths than male-led countries such as the US, Brazil, UK or India, it doesnrsquot explain male-led countries like Greece, for example where Covid deaths remained relatively low.Who can forget Boris Johnsonrsquos ill-fated declaration that hersquod been to a hospital where there were coronavirus patients and he had shaken everyonersquos hand. In the Philippines, which had one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in south east Asia, President Duterte told police and military to take matters into their own hands when dealing with lockdown breakers: ldquoShoot them dead...Do you understand  Dead. None of these are words we could imagine tumbling from current women leadersrsquo mouths.Instead, women like Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel and, latterly, after an arguable initial hesitancy, Nicola Sturgeon, have taken a more active listening approach. Taking advice from experts, collaborating with colleagues and, importantly, keeping the ego firmly in check, these leaders were honest and clear from the start. Whilst many world leaders were playing the threat down, Merkel told Germans that % of the population might be affected and that it would be Germanyrsquos biggest challenge since the Second World War.Ardernrsquos early motto was: ldquoWe must go hard and we must go early. In January, in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-Wen introduced strict travel restrictions and quarantine controls for passengers entering from high-risk areas, resulting in just under  deaths in a country of nearly  million. But despite my strong impulse to declare womanhood to be the reason for this, the truth is maybe a little more prosaic. Perhaps being women simply predisposes them to having certain qualities required for good leadership ndash strong communication skills, empathy, honesty and trust. The aforementioned men are just sadly lacking in those.Leaders who were more risk averse at the thought of many deaths and who therefore took decisions to shut down whole economies will now be tested as economies begin to open up again. The criticism is that they have not been risk averse when it comes to the damage they have done to their economies.But it looks like the gamble to close down hard and fast in the hope that less damage might be done to the economy might just pay off. Germanyrsquos economy appears to be recovering and schemes like the Kurzarbeit programme, which allows workers to work reduced hours instead of being laid off, is expected to be extended by Merkel for  months to bring stability for workers, which the end of the UKs furlough scheme may not.In Scotland, Sturgeon is calling for furloughing to be extended, whilst clamping down on clusters of the virus and rule-breakers like a tough headmistress. In New Zealand, a quick economic recovery has been put on hold by Arden as she locks down again to eliminate, rather than simply contain, the virus.

He accepted a nomination that had eluded him for over three decades because of personal tragedy, political stumbles and rivals who proved more dynamic.But coronavirus denied him the typical celebration, complete with the customary balloon drop that both parties often use to fete their new nominees. Instead, Mr Biden spoke to a largely empty arena near his Delaware home.Afterwards, fireworks lit the sky outside the arena where supporters waited in a car park, honking horns and flashing headlights in a moment that finally lent a jovial feel to the event.The keynote address was the speech of a letime for Biden, who would be the oldest president ever electedhe defeats Donald Trump in November.Mr Trump, who is , publicly doubts Bidens mental capacity and calls him \"Slow Joe\", but with the nation watching, he was firm and clear.Still, the convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energise his sprawling coalition.Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost both legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Mr Biden has \"common decency\".Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in US history, said Mr Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.And Pete Buttigieg, a -year-old former mayor and a gay military veteran, noted that Mr Biden came out in favour of same-sex marriage as vice president even before former president Barack Obama.\"Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,\" Mr Buttigieg said.\"Its the struggle to call out what is good for every American.\"Above all, Mr Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice - and Mr Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.Mr Bidens positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by Mr Obama and others the night before.The th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falterMr Trump is re-elected, while Mr Bidens running mate, Kamala Harris, the -year-old Calornia senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, warned that Americans lives and livelihoods were at risk.Mr Bidens Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy.They have drawn a sharp contrast with Mr Trumps policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centred and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nations mounting crises and policy challenges.Mr Bidens call for unity comes as some strategists worry that Democrats cannot retake the White House simply by tearing Mr Trump down, that Mr Biden needs to give his sprawling coalition something to vote for.Though he has been in the public spotlight for decades as a Delaware senator, much of the electorate knows little about Mr Bidens background before he began serving as Mr Obamas vice president in .Thursdays convention served as a national reintroduction of sorts that drew on some of the most painful moments of his le.\"I know how mean and cruel and unfair le can be sometimes,\" Mr Biden said. He added: \"I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.\"As a schoolboy, he was mocked for a severe stutter. He became a widower at just  after losing his we and infant daughter to a car accident.

It is also claimed as the inspiration for his short story The Wreckers, and his cousin David Stevenson designed the lighthouse which isthe islandrsquos sole piece of architectural furniture.In fact there are also the remains of a chapel and a castle, testament to a history of inhabitation that goes back probably to the Christian hermit St Baldred in the th century and certainly to the th century by which time the Bass Rock was in the hands of the Lauder family. Several of the Jameses visited at one time or another and more than one of them used the castle as a prison.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise.

have trusted the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged. Children were also set toto school on a part-time basis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor celebrates Mass under strict social distancing in St Peter’s Cathedral, west Belfast this morning.

Masks are also mandatory on public transport - although again enforcement is largely non-existent - and will be strongly encouraged for activities involving large numbers of staff or pupils in an enclosed space.Expert#s views:Queen#s University Belfastvirologist Dr Connor Bamford said that he believed Northern Ireland#s coronavirus lockdown had been successful.He said that the virus had been slowed down with cases being reported in single and double digits most days.However, while lockdown had worked well, he believes the virus was always present in Northern Ireland.We were always detecting cases and we were always seeing small clusters that would pop up in dferent parts of the country, he said.Dr Bamford said it was anticipated that, as restrictions were relaxed, cases would rise because the virus was present and most people remained susceptible. He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Read More New lockdown restrictions comingCovid- cases continue to rise in Northern Ireland - Swann NI close to needing localised Covid restrictions, warns Prof Ian YoungDr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks.

But when asked about party members who came under criticism for attending Mr Storey’s funeral in June, Ms McDonald said she does not think there is an equivalence between a funeral and a “golfing shindig”.Earlier, DUP MP Carla Lockhart said Mr Cullinane’s comments show that Sinn Fein is “certainly a partitionist party when it comes to irony”.“Sinn Fein’s demands on Irish government ministers to resign for breach of Covid- guidelines begs the question why two dferent standards by the same party in two dferent countries  If ministers who breach the rules must resign there why not here ” she added. “True to form, Sinn Fein brazenly ignored the public outcry at the double standards and demands for resignations.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Northern Ireland has been reminded by Mr Cullinane that when it comes to his party it is a case of do as we say not as we do.”Former Fine Gael MEP and Alliance leader John Cushnahan said Sinn Fein has “no right whatsoever” to condemn those politicians who attended the golf dinner.SDLP MLA Colin McGrath questioned whether David Cullinane’s comments represent a Sinn Fein policy that “doesn’t apply across the border”.Dara Calleary’s resignation comes just  days into his role as Agriculture Minister, a position to which he was appointed to after Taoiseach Micheal Martin sacked his predecessor Barry Cowen amid controversy over a drink-driving offence.Last night Ireland’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said it is “very clear” that the event held in Galway was not in line with public health guidance.Current guidelines state that no more than  people should gather indoors in the Republic.Dr Glynn said: “There’s a very justiable and understandable anger in Ireland today. It’s not misplaced.”Speaking to RTE, Taoiseach Micheal Martin denied his leadership had been damaged.He said the Mr Calleary had paid a “terrible price” but had done the right thing in resigning.Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said what happened was “wrong an inexcusable”.He added: “There are people all over this country who have made huge sacrices and who continue to make huge sacrices and at a minimum, the Irish people need to see those rules followed by members of the Oireachtas.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIrish agriculture minister resigns after attending golf eventIrish Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has resigned after attending an indoor golf society event with  other people.News PremiumBobby Storey funeral: Unionists aim to keep pressure on Sinn Fein#s Michelle O#NeillUnionists are aiming to keep pressure on Sinn Fein over the funeral of Bobby Storey more than a month after the row began.GalleryCoronavirusConfusion over Executive rules on foreign trips as MLA cancels holiday to Italy after backlashStormont has been thrown into confusion over its Covid- holiday rules after an MLA sparked controversy by saying she#d be taking a family break to Italy - only to cancel it after she came in for criticism.Northern IrelandSinn Fein abused society with funeral attendance – BeattieSinn Fein leaders abused wider society in Northern Ireland by flouting coronavirus rules at Bobby Storey’s funeral, the Assembly has been told.Most ReadBelfast woman jailed for bus journey during quarantine on Isle of Man visitMoville businessman John Mullan and his two children die in tragic Donegal road accidentCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Robin Swann announces new restrictions on gatheringsNew pictures emerge of The Northman film set starring Nicole Kidman and Skarsgård brothersCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: No new deaths and  cases of Covid- reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irish language campaigners regard it as a highly restrictive policy.The Alliance move is a compromise between the status quo and a Sinn Fein proposal that would see the signs erecteda majority of respondents in a consultation process backed them.It will go before Belfast City Council#s strategic policy and resources committee meeting today. Alliance group leader Michael Long said he hoped that it would receive both unionist and nationalist support as a way forward.Currently, a third of the eligible electorate in a Belfast street must sign a petition to begin a consultation process on bilingual signs.All residents who are on the electoral register are then sent a letter asking for their views on the proposal.There are three options: #yes#, #no#, or #don#t care#. At least two-thirds must support the move to erect the signs. A #don#t care# or a failure to reply is interpreted as a negative by the council.Earlier this year Sinn Fein proposed that the policy be changed. A third of the eligible electorate would still be required to initiate the process but the consent of % plus one of respondents would determinethe petition was successful.#Don#t cares# and non-respondents would be considered void votes rather than negative responses.Alliance claims that this would leave the council open to legal challenge. The party is proposing that the trigger for a petition be reduced from a third to % of the eligible electorate on a street. But the support of % plus one of all residents - not just those who take part in the survey - would be needed to erect the signs.The issue of non-respondents would be settled by revised protocol for managing engagement with consultees.Mr Long said: As someone who supports the visibility of the Irish language increasing, I want to see it being made easier for dual language street signage being erected.I believe our proposal makes it easier for residents to obtain dual signage but also that it recognises the rights of those who prefer not to have dual signs.He added: Our proposal would make Belfast#s policy one of the most progressive in Northern Ireland, which is only sensible when the city has the highest number of Irish language speakers.Alliance wants to see agreement on this issue. Unfortunately, due to the politicisation of the Irish language it is an area of contention.We are asking both unionist and nationalist councillors to support our proposal at the strategic policy and resources committee meeting on Friday.Cross-party agreement would be a step in the right direction of getting to a day when the Irish language is no longer a isive issue.Belfast Most ReadBelfast woman jailed for bus journey during quarantine on Isle of Man visitMoville businessman John Mullan and his two children die in tragic Donegal road accidentCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Robin Swann announces new restrictions on gatheringsNew pictures emerge of The Northman film set starring Nicole Kidman and Skarsgård brothersCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: No new deaths and  cases of Covid- reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,” Mr Buttigieg said.“It’s the struggle to call out what is good for every American.”Above all, Mr Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice — and Mr Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.Mr Biden’s positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by Mr Obama and others the night before.The th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falterMr Trump is re-elected, while Mr Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, the -year-old Calornia senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, warned that Americans’ lives and livelihoods were at risk.Mr Biden’s Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy.Mr Biden has maintained a polling advantage over Mr Trump for much of the year, but it remains to be seen whether the Democratic nominee’s approach to politics and policy will genuinely excite the coalition he is courting in an era of uncompromising partisanship.Belfast Related ContentVideoVideo NewsUS election polls: Trump trails Biden by seven pointsMost ReadBelfast woman jailed for bus journey during quarantine on Isle of Man visitCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Robin Swann announces new restrictions on gatheringsMoville businessman John Mullan and his two children die in tragic Donegal road accidentNew pictures emerge of The Northman film set starring Nicole Kidman and Skarsgård brothersCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: No new deaths and  cases of Covid- reported,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

It was the first time Ballinascreen were levelin a game they trailed by nine points coming up to half time. With a superior score dference, a draw wouldve been enough for Lavey, but points for Cleary and Aaron Kelly put them ahead. Fintan Bradley had a late free, but his low effort was saved by goalkeeper Marty Mulgrew and it was Screen that held on for a victory that seemed unlikely for long periods. googletag.cmd.push Their reward is a semi-final rematch with Kevin Lynchs, with Slaughtneil facing parish rivals Swatragh on the other side of the draw. Lavey will now play in the junior semi-final against Coleraine, with Banagher and Na Magha in the other semi-final. The @ScreenGAA hurlers show their respect for Hugh McWilliams before tonight’s #DerrySHC game #GAABelong pic ZxMmiuIe — Michael McMullan August ,     Both teams stood for a minute silence in memory of Ballinascreen sponsor Hugh McWilliams before the game. Lavey had the breeze at their back and with greater urgency in their play went four points ahead before Screen got to grips with the game. The Erins Own men were awarded a penalty but referee Niall Clford adjudged Fintan Bradley to have broken the line when he shot and the penalty was overturned. googletag.cmd.push Bradley was putting over some sweet scores, but missed a simple free before the break. Noel Raffertyand Paul Cleary scored early second half points for Screen, as they came back into the game. The concern at Davitt Park was the falling light and as the game developed, visibility was becoming more of a problem. Midway through the second half, Colm Murphy can feel hard done by to pick up a second yellow card and Lavey were down to  men. Seconds earlier, Noel Rafferty looked to have a certain penalty shout waved on. Without Murphy, Lavey were not able to match Screens hunger around the breaking ball and the game was already slipping away from them. Two Fintan Bradley frees looked to have weathered the storm until McSorleys winning goal.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An accident in stage six of last weekends Rally Liepāja in Latvia, saw him forced out of the race. Devine, the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year, was out to make amends following an early retirement on the opening round in Italy late last month. Callum missed the pre event shakedown and qualying due to an issue with his Hyundai i R, but the mechanics had ready for the start of the event. He was beginning to grow in confidence on his first loose surface event at this level. Steady driving saw Callum and co-driver Brian Hoy work their way into the top  early on day two and up to fourth place among the ERC Junior crews. googletag.cmd.push It all came to an end on stage six , as Devine recalls. “We were actually just starting to get into it and growing in confidence. As I mentioned before the event, it’s not a place you want to get things wrong as the speeds are so high. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. We carried a bit too much speed into a fast right hander and caught the undergrowth on the outside of the corner, sending us into a roll and out of the event. Myself and Brian are okay, just a little sore and thankfully all the safety equipment stood up to the accident, the Hyundai is a strong car. googletag.cmd.push I’m just so disappointed for all the team who worked so hard over the last month. To have taken just one point from the opening pair of rallies is sickening and doesn’t reflect all the work we’ve put in, hopefully we can put it right before the end of the season.” Devine’s accident casts some doubt over his participation in the next round of the championship, Rallye Azores in mid-September. The PCRS team will assess the damage to the car in the coming days but evenit can be sorted in time to make the boat to travel to the Azores, presently Portugal and its associated territories aren’t on the Irish green list for travel. “If the car can be sorted for Azores, travel restrictions could be an issue. As it stands, not only myself and Brian, but also all the mechanics would have to isolate for two weeks after ing to Ireland after the rally. I work between events so to isolate for two weeks uponwould be a big problem. Obviously government guidelines are changing all the time so we’ll just have to wait and see. It’s worth pointing out this isn’t just a problem for us, it’s a problem for all competitors and teams in the championship.” While Rallye Azores may be in doubt, one thing that isn’t in doubt in Devine’s commitment to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy. “I realise how lucky I am to have this opportunity and I’m ready to knuckle down and refocus in preparation for our next ERC event,” Devine continued. Following Rallye Azores, the remaining rounds of the  ERC will take place in Cyprus, Hungary and the Canary Islands.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Not only does dance allow kids to get their energy out, itrsquos also a great way for children to express themselves. Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference. The week was jam-packed with lots of dancing, fitness, teamwork, arts, crafts and fun.Dance teacher Christopher Owens said: ldquoWe are delighted with the success of our summer dance camp. has posed signicant disappointments for our dancers on a competitive front with event after event being cancelled.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

It provides more space for pedestrians and for the numerous cafes and restaurants in the locality.Whilst the core principle of pedestrianisation is nothing new, the Dublin trial shows there is a willingness to try something quick and innovative to address the constraints imposed by the Covid- pandemic and the longer-term sht in shopping habits.This is a huge challenge for retail and the hospitality industry in Dublin but also for traders and restaurants north of the border. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Maybe the results of Dublin’s experiment can help convince drivers here to be slightly lesscar-reliant. By making small changes to our urban environment, then monitoring and learning from them, we can help improve our much-cherished town centres and high streets.Cllr Brian Pope , Banbridge"},{"url":null,"title":"unionist community getting older shrinking and needs get serious about future ","story":"LIVE Coronavirus NI: Health Minister says only  people can now meet indoors |R value in NI now . | Meat plant closes due to Covid cluster |  new cases of COVID- detected say Department of HealthFuneral details for IFA referee Richard Scott who died in accident at work with NIENewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsOpinionThe unionist community is getting older, shrinking, and needs to get serious about the futureAlex Kane’s pieces of July  and July , and again on August  raise the issue of the Persuadables.By Henry McKeownFriday, st August , : amUpdated Friday, st August , : pm\"\"Playing to the loyalist gallery will not keep the Union safe, this correspondent suggests‘Jibber-jabber Johnson is no champion of Union’Persuadables are those from the ever-increasing group who would describe themselves as pro-Union but could be persuaded otherwise.Alex has suggested Alliance voters might be in this category while there are others who, to their electoral regret, have described Alliance as no more than bed-fellows of Sinn Fein. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Now that is what I call boxing yourself into an ever-decreasing corner.A few months ago I listened to a lecture from retired Supreme Court Judge Jonathan Sumption whose views, interpretations, and decisions are shown to be very much on the conservative side.It surprised me when he said that democracy is not rule by the majority, but is in fact achieved by ruling with consent of the minority.I am of an age now where I can look back and say Unionism has not, and I’m saying it mildly, done this consent-of-the-minority stuff very well.With a solid majority, confidence, and complete control for many years, Protestant unionism has played to and been played by its vested institutions.Protestant Unionism had plenty of time to sort this out and – let us be honest this time – failed badly.Statesmanship was drowned out, or backed down in the face of the loudest, angriest voices, or  saviours and promises.As I get older I look and see the community that I come fromgetting smaller, getting older, becoming even more inward and backward-looking – and worst of all now grasping at any  saviour.Doing even more of the same things that have already failed, while expecting a dferent outcome, is an easy trap to fall into. It also, by the way, fits the definition of insanity.I hope I have been harsh, although two borders – one at Newry and one at Larne port – and being firmly put in the naughty chair by Boris and England should be stark enough reminder.Ms O’Neill sees a United Ireland in  years, which I strongly doubt she and her cohort can deliver.For the Persuadabales however, when it comes to being swayed by a Claire Hannah, Colm Eastwood or Daniel McCrossan, it would be a very dferent story, given the right pragmatic conditions.Henry McKeown, Ballymena: We are drting blindly towards a new lockdown – and we do so at our perilA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested.
