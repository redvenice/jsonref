This is up slightly on the 16.51mbps recorded in last year\u0027s survey, which saw the UK in 31st.The fastest broadband speeds are in Singapore, which is renowned as a global technology hub. Its average figure is over three times faster than in this country, at 60.39mbps.Second place goes to Sweden, ahead of Denmark and Norway. Perhaps surprisingly, Romania comes fifth in the league at 38.6mbps, which is more than twice the speed achieved in Britain. Other poorer countries where speeds are well ahead of the UK\u0027s include Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia and Andorra.The data was collected by M-Lab, a partnership between Google, Princeton University and the Open Technology Institute in Washington.It was compiled by Cable, which compares broadband speeds and services. The figures show the average global broadband speed rose from 7.4mbps last May to 9.1mbps this year – an increase of 23 per cent.By comparison, the rise in UK average speeds was just 12 per cent.          Britain has slipped four places in the world broadband speed league, leaving its network lagging well behind the likes of Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and RomaniaThe key to achieving superfast access to the internet is a network of fibre-optic cables direct to homes and businesses – known as fibre to the premises (FTTP). This could replace Britain\u0027s old-fashioned copper wire telephone system, parts of which are more than 100 years old.At present, just 560,000 premises in the UK have FTTP connections. There are plans to reach 3million by the end of 2020 under upgrades run by BT subsidiary Openreach.Dan Howdle, consumer telecoms analyst at Cable, described the UK\u0027s position in the global league as \u0027sad\u0027.He said: \u0027Compared to many other countries, the UK has simply come too late to a full fibre solution. Despite plans to roll out FTTP to homes across the next decade or so, the UK is likely to fall further behind while we wait.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Pamplona bull run 2018 need know San Fermins Running Bulls festival","story":"The groups said in a press release that they ‘understand the indignation’, but that it ‘cannot be used as an excuse to exploit our fight to make simplistic analyses’.‘Focusing on just one case makes the rest of the other assaults invisible, it undermines their importance and highlights elements that have little to do with reality,’ the statement read.‘All assaults are important, all women who suffer or who have suffered from aggression need our solidarity, and no assault, be it of high or low intensity, can be justified.’Other protests have been organized to share anti-bullfighting sentiments.Aida Gasc, director of AnimaNaturals in Spain, told Euronews: ‘All the bulls that participate in the morning in the runs are driven directly in the afternoon to the bullring where they’ll be tortured to death.‘That’s something that most people don’t know and that’s where the greatest and most bloody animal abuse at this kind of show happens.’ Beyonce, Jay Z and Ed Sheeran to headline Global Citizen Festival in South AfricaIs Colton Underwood a virgin?

Any advice much needed.\u0027          Manager Gareth Southgate roared with jubilation as the referee signalled full time   England have booked their place in the semi-finals of the Russia World Cup after defeating Sweden 2-0 in SamaraAlthough flights and match tickets will be expensive, fans can still grab themselves a bargain when it comes to accommodation.Single rooms within a few miles of the city centre are available online for less than £20 a night via Trivago with more central options starting at £60 - but some four and five-star Moscow rooms will cost at least £1,000-per night.Match tickets are limited via the FIFA website but are being offered on resale sites.This is because Russians were offered thousands of tickets are face value before the tournament, which they can then sell on.Fans from countries like Germany, Brazil, and Spain, who expected to be in the semi-finals instead of England, are also selling off the tickets they no longer need.    If England fans get a ticket they\u0027ll need to apply for a visa by tomorrow to ensure they can enter Russia in time for the game.  Fans wishing to travel this week will either need a valid visa or a FIFA FAN ID, which acts as a visa for people visiting Russia for the World Cup.Although it\u0027s possible to fast-track a visa application, the shortest time-frame offered online is 72 hours, making it impossible to obtain one before you\u0027d need to fly to Moscow for the Croatia game.You can, however, apply for a FAN ID here, providing you have a ticket number for an upcoming game or one that has already been played.Applications take about 10 minutes and should be approved within 24 hours. You can then either print your FAN ID or collect it in Russia. The document - which includes a unique number and passport-style photo - is also used to enter stadiums and to book free rail travel.              For the very richest people can charter a private jet for at least £22,000 for a one-way tripSaturday\u0027s 2-0 victory over Sweden secured a place in the semi-final in the Russian capital on Wednesday evening.It also guarantees England will play twice more, in that game and hopefully in Sunday afternoon\u0027s final against either France or Belgium, which will also be in Moscow.But even defeat to Croatia in Wednesday\u0027s semi-final would mean playing in the third-place match, which takes place in St Petersburg on Saturday afternoon.  BBC football pundits in Moscow joined in the raucous celebrations. After analysing the match – which was played 500 miles away in Samara– from their studio in Red Square, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker posted videos of themselves belting out songs in a bar.Egged on by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, Shearer sang Lionel Richie\u0027s All Night Long, using breadsticks as a pretend microphone. Earlier he and his colleagues sang along to the Three Lions anthem. Shearer told fans: \u0027It\u0027s coming home. A little bit of a party going on.\u0027The Football Supporters\u0027 Federation predicts that more than 10,000 fans will make the pilgrimage to Moscow for Wednesday\u0027s clash, the first time in 28 years that England have reached a World Cup semi-final. However, many will face problems finding flights, accommodation and – more importantly – match tickets.Some England fans already have tickets for Wednesday\u0027s game as the FA sold an allocation of 2,180 back in January. Thousands more were sold to England fans through world governing body Fifa. A Fifa spokesman said yesterday: \u0027Tickets which become available for the remaining matches are sold via fifa.com and it is a dynamic process. It depends on the numbers which are resold by fans who have bought them but no longer want to attend matches.\u0027We advise fans of availability through a traffic light system of colours. For France v Belgium there were still some available. Those not being used come up for sale automatically.\u0027There were some in the red zone for England v Croatia meaning they were available but they are now in grey which means they have been purchased. You must have a fan ID issued by the Russian authorities to get a visa to get into Russia.\u0027 Supporters\u0027 chiefs predict the rush for Wednesday\u0027s semi-final will match the last-minute dash to Italy for the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in Turin. That match ended in tears for England – and star midfielder Paul Gascoigne – with defeat in penalty shoot-out.The only other occasion England reached the semi-finals was on home soil in 1966, on the way to lifting the trophy.England manager Gareth Southgate said yesterday that winning the World Cup in Russia would be an even bigger triumph.\u0027We\u0027ve talked, touched briefly, on the team which won. How they\u0027re still held and revered,\u0027 he said. \u0027Perhaps in the modern era that would be even crazier, social media and everything else, the global thing is so much bigger.\u0027 Captain Harry Kane said: \u0027We are not finished yet.

The jury, of seven men and five women, were asked before they were sworn in whether they followed racing cyclist Boardman on social media Mr Philpotts said: \u0027It\u0027s the prosecution case that Liam Rosney had time to see Mrs Boardman and to stop in time to avoid driving over her as he did, but he clearly did neither of those things.\u0027Mr Philpotts told the court phone provider records showed four calls between Mr Rosney and his wife in the run-up to the crash, with the last one terminated four seconds before the crash is calculated to have happened.But the calls did not appear on the log of his phone handset, which was recovered by police from Mrs Rosney, who arrived at the scene after the crash.When Mrs Rosney\u0027s phone was seized by police in November 2016, all calls from the date of the collision and before had been deleted from the call log.Mr Philpotts said: \u0027The prosecution say that this is a case which tragically illustrates the potential extreme danger of using a mobile telephone whilst driving.\u0027As I\u0027ve told you more than once, Liam Rosney\u0027s speed leading up to the collision was perfectly reasonable.\u0027There\u0027s no suggestion, I repeat, that he was under the influence of drink or drugs.          Liam and Victoria Rosney appeared in good spirits as they arrived at Mold Magistrates\u0027 Court in December last year \u0027But, he was so distracted by the use of his mobile telephone that he was driving dangerously at the time when Mrs Boardman unfortunately became dismounted from her bicycle.\u0027He added: \u0027The prosecution say both of these defendants well know the significance of their telephone conversations in the time leading up to the point very shortly before the collision.\u0027They knew it and they deleted the relevant calls from their respective handsets.\u0027Kayleigh Anders, who had witnessed the crash while driving, said Mr Rosney did not seem to realise he had hit Mrs Boardman at first.She said: \u0027He was looking left and then down, and then left and then down. I think he was on his phone.\u0027She told the court that when he realised what had happened, she heard him say \u0027she came from nowhere\u0027.The jury, of seven men and five women, were asked before they were sworn in whether they followed racing cyclist Boardman on social media.The trial is expected to last a week. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/07/09/15/3580056-0-Turkish_President_Tayyip_Erdogan_announced_his_ruling_AK_Party_s-a-2_1531146369529.jpg","title":"Mutant calf born TWO HEADS shocks locals farm Brazil","story":"A mutant calf has shocked locals after being born with two heads at a farm in BrazilJust last week, another mutant calf was born in  Poland.Local vet Karolina Szarowska was stunned as she described helping with the delivery of the two-headed calf in the village of Kowalewo Pomorskie.   She wrote: \u0027Two heads are better than on.

We have set the plan for four people so if they want to take five out (at the same time), then they need to change the plan.\u0027The dramatic and dangerous rescue at the Tham Luang cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai was launched on Sunday and four boys were brought out that day.

Some of the parents told Reuters they had not been told who had been rescued and that they were not allowed to visit the hospital.Narongsak said the rescued boys had not been identified out of respect for the families whose sons were still trapped, adding that the boys were being kept away from their parents due to fear of infection.Medical teams previously said concerns included hypothermia and an airborne lung infection known as \u0027cave disease\u0027, which is caused by bat and bird droppings.Somboon Sompiangjai, 38, the father of one of the trapped boys, said parents were told by rescuers ahead of Sunday\u0027s operation the \u0027strongest children\u0027 would be brought out first.\u0027We have not been told which child has been brought out ...

Whereas Mr Davis called himself ‘a reluctant conscript’, Mr Raab may prove more actively obstructive and on top of the legalistic detail.At 44, Dominic Raab has the composure and coolness of an older man. Much is made of his trimness of physique, attributed not least to his boxing and his third-dan black belt in karate. He is such an exercise freak that eight years ago he had to have a hip replacement. ‘Too much kicking Lib Dems over the years,’ he joked.Born in Buckinghamshire, he was educated at grammar school in Amersham and took a law degree from Oxford before doing a master’s at Cambridge.

When the boss of Persimmon Homes was given a £75million handout, Mr Raab called it ‘almost unfathomable’.On leaving university he joined City law firm Linklaters and was seconded briefly to Liberty, the human rights pressure group, and to offices in Brussels to develop an expertise on EU and World Trade Organisation law. In 2000 he joined the Foreign Office – to work on, among other things, the laws governing outer space – and in 2003 he was posted to the Hague to specialise in bringing war criminals to justice. He became MP for the safe Tory seat of Esher and Walton, succeeding the pro-EU Ian Taylor (Raab was chosen in an open primary). For the previous four years he had worked for the Conservatives in Opposition where his bosses included – choicely – not only Mr Davis but also the Europhile Dominic Grieve. In the 2010 election result, he doubled the Tories’ majority in Esher.          Dominic Raab leaves 10 Downing Street after being appointed as Brexit Secretary on MondayHe was soon impressing Westminster with his Commons performances and became a justice minister in the Cameron government. When Mrs May became PM she inexplicably dropped him from ministerial office, but she brought him back a year later as a justice minister. Word at the Commons is that Mrs May was a little scared of him.In the Cameroon modernising years, Mr Raab was pro-gay marriage but spoke out boldly – some would say bravely – against unreasonably militant feminists, saying that they could be ‘amongst the most obnoxious bigots’. That created a mighty to-do among bien pensants, but Raab stuck to his argument that positive discrimination against young men was exactly that – discriminatory – and the opposite of meritocracy.A few months ago he managed to find himself in the newspapers when his diary secretary was alleged to be working as a call-girl (rest assured, Mr Raab is a happily married father). But it was what she told an undercover reporter that almost caused more controversy.She said her boss ordered the same combination of food for lunch from Pret a Manger every day: namely, a chicken caesar and bacon baguette, a superfruit salad and a watermelon smoothie. The 820 calories in question – which the minister denied eating every day – became so notorious that they were called the Dominic Raab Special.Whatever the truth about his lunchtime favourite, he may have rather a lot else on his plate in the coming weeks. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/21/4E126D1300000578-5935529-image-m-12_1531169856654.jpg","title":"Russian firms selling sick Novichok products including themed shirts craft beer vodka","story":"    A Novichok-branded T-shirt is among a range of items named after the deadly nerve agent          Novichok (written here in Cyrillic script) is being used as the name for a brand of vodkaThe use of the name comes as Russian politicians are openly claiming Britain deliberately poisoned Dawn Sturgess, 44, who has died, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, who is fighting for his life.

Any advice much needed.\u0027          Manager Gareth Southgate roared with jubilation as the referee signalled full time   England have booked their place in the semi-finals of the Russia World Cup after defeating Sweden 2-0 in SamaraAlthough flights and match tickets will be expensive, fans can still grab themselves a bargain when it comes to accommodation.Single rooms within a few miles of the city centre are available online for less than £20 a night via Trivago with more central options starting at £60 - but some four and five-star Moscow rooms will cost at least £1,000-per night.Match tickets are limited via the FIFA website but are being offered on resale sites.This is because Russians were offered thousands of tickets are face value before the tournament, which they can then sell on.Fans from countries like Germany, Brazil, and Spain, who expected to be in the semi-finals instead of England, are also selling off the tickets they no longer need.    If England fans get a ticket they\u0027ll need to apply for a visa by tomorrow to ensure they can enter Russia in time for the game.  Fans wishing to travel this week will either need a valid visa or a FIFA FAN ID, which acts as a visa for people visiting Russia for the World Cup.Although it\u0027s possible to fast-track a visa application, the shortest time-frame offered online is 72 hours, making it impossible to obtain one before you\u0027d need to fly to Moscow for the Croatia game.You can, however, apply for a FAN ID here, providing you have a ticket number for an upcoming game or one that has already been played.Applications take about 10 minutes and should be approved within 24 hours. You can then either print your FAN ID or collect it in Russia. The document - which includes a unique number and passport-style photo - is also used to enter stadiums and to book free rail travel.              For the very richest people can charter a private jet for at least £22,000 for a one-way tripSaturday\u0027s 2-0 victory over Sweden secured a place in the semi-final in the Russian capital on Wednesday evening.It also guarantees England will play twice more, in that game and hopefully in Sunday afternoon\u0027s final against either France or Belgium, which will also be in Moscow.But even defeat to Croatia in Wednesday\u0027s semi-final would mean playing in the third-place match, which takes place in St Petersburg on Saturday afternoon.  BBC football pundits in Moscow joined in the raucous celebrations. After analysing the match – which was played 500 miles away in Samara– from their studio in Red Square, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker posted videos of themselves belting out songs in a bar.Egged on by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, Shearer sang Lionel Richie\u0027s All Night Long, using breadsticks as a pretend microphone. Earlier he and his colleagues sang along to the Three Lions anthem. Shearer told fans: \u0027It\u0027s coming home. A little bit of a party going on.\u0027The Football Supporters\u0027 Federation predicts that more than 10,000 fans will make the pilgrimage to Moscow for Wednesday\u0027s clash, the first time in 28 years that England have reached a World Cup semi-final. However, many will face problems finding flights, accommodation and – more importantly – match tickets.Some England fans already have tickets for Wednesday\u0027s game as the FA sold an allocation of 2,180 back in January. Thousands more were sold to England fans through world governing body Fifa. A Fifa spokesman said yesterday: \u0027Tickets which become available for the remaining matches are sold via fifa.com and it is a dynamic process. It depends on the numbers which are resold by fans who have bought them but no longer want to attend matches.\u0027We advise fans of availability through a traffic light system of colours. For France v Belgium there were still some available. Those not being used come up for sale automatically.\u0027There were some in the red zone for England v Croatia meaning they were available but they are now in grey which means they have been purchased. You must have a fan ID issued by the Russian authorities to get a visa to get into Russia.\u0027 Supporters\u0027 chiefs predict the rush for Wednesday\u0027s semi-final will match the last-minute dash to Italy for the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in Turin. That match ended in tears for England – and star midfielder Paul Gascoigne – with defeat in penalty shoot-out.The only other occasion England reached the semi-finals was on home soil in 1966, on the way to lifting the trophy.England manager Gareth Southgate said yesterday that winning the World Cup in Russia would be an even bigger triumph.\u0027We\u0027ve talked, touched briefly, on the team which won. How they\u0027re still held and revered,\u0027 he said. \u0027Perhaps in the modern era that would be even crazier, social media and everything else, the global thing is so much bigger.\u0027 Captain Harry Kane said: \u0027We are not finished yet.

Now Kamran is urging others in his position to be \u0027ballsy\u0027 and think outside the box if they\u0027re struggling to get a job \u0027Then I struggled with exams as I came from a coursework-based course at sixth form.\u0027When I finished I wanted to get out of my comfort zone, I was desperate to succeed by myself and be independent.Diabetes sufferer wins £2,000 after having her fizzy drink...Would-be doctor, 22, killed himself after his \u0027friends\u0027...Share this article\u0027I knew I wasn\u0027t competitive enough on paper so when I was sending off my CV to recruiters they were just falling off the top of a pile.\u0027I was starting to feel really disheartened, I went into a really dark spot because I was sending off applications and hearing nothing back.\u0027In the end it was Kamran\u0027s unrelenting work ethic from the age of 16 that impressed his new employer who offered him a job on the spot after his interview.          Riding high: After his innovative method of getting employers\u0027 attention Kamran has now got himself a brand new jobKamran said the company director saw his potential and despite his low grades decided to give him a shot.He added: \u0027Nowadays you need to do something that makes you stand out.\u0027I have been working in retail since I was 16 and I had a summer job at a law firm doing admin.\u0027I have the work ethic and I believe you should never give up.\u0027Since handing out the CVs around 20 recruiters have been in touch wanting to offer me work. The director of one company personally reached out to me via LinkedIn.\u0027She said she believed in my potential and was interested in what I\u0027d done, I was really honoured.\u0027On Wednesday night I had a call asking if I was free for an interview on Thursday morning. I went along and I\u0027m proud to say I got a job offer which I have accepted.\u0027Now Kamran is urging others in his position to be \u0027ballsy\u0027 and think outside the box if they\u0027re struggling to get a job.    Since handing out the CVs around 20 recruiters have been in touch with Kamran wanting to offer him work. One company director personally reached out to him via LinkedIn He claims this has been the best experience of his life and recommends forward-thinking students follow in his footsteps instead of sending their CVs into \u0027an abyss\u0027 of recruitment websites.Kamran said: \u0027The feedback and support I\u0027ve received has been like no response I\u0027ve had before. It\u0027s really shocked me.\u0027People have said it was a really ballsy thing to do and it took initiative.\u0027You have to think outside the box because recruiters will get between 80 and 100 applications for each vacancy.\u0027I\u0027ve never had this much positive attention, it\u0027s really great.\u0027I 110 per cent recommend anyone coming out of university who might have received a lower grade because they\u0027re having a hard time, or whatever reason, tries this.\u0027Try something innovative.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/16/4E10463200000578-5934153-image-m-35_1531149635652.jpg","title":"Mutant calf born TWO HEADS shocks locals farm Brazil","story":"A mutant calf has shocked locals after being born with two heads at a farm in BrazilJust last week, another mutant calf was born in  Poland.Local vet Karolina Szarowska was stunned as she described helping with the delivery of the two-headed calf in the village of Kowalewo Pomorskie.   She wrote: \u0027Two heads are better than on.

We have set the plan for four people so if they want to take five out (at the same time), then they need to change the plan.\u0027The dramatic and dangerous rescue at the Tham Luang cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai was launched on Sunday and four boys were brought out that day.

Some of the parents told Reuters they had not been told who had been rescued and that they were not allowed to visit the hospital.Narongsak said the rescued boys had not been identified out of respect for the families whose sons were still trapped, adding that the boys were being kept away from their parents due to fear of infection.Medical teams previously said concerns included hypothermia and an airborne lung infection known as \u0027cave disease\u0027, which is caused by bat and bird droppings.Somboon Sompiangjai, 38, the father of one of the trapped boys, said parents were told by rescuers ahead of Sunday\u0027s operation the \u0027strongest children\u0027 would be brought out first.\u0027We have not been told which child has been brought out ...

When the boss of Persimmon Homes was given a £75million handout, Mr Raab called it ‘almost unfathomable’.On leaving university he joined City law firm Linklaters and was seconded briefly to Liberty, the human rights pressure group, and to offices in Brussels to develop an expertise on EU and World Trade Organisation law. In 2000 he joined the Foreign Office – to work on, among other things, the laws governing outer space – and in 2003 he was posted to the Hague to specialise in bringing war criminals to justice. He became MP for the safe Tory seat of Esher and Walton, succeeding the pro-EU Ian Taylor (Raab was chosen in an open primary). For the previous four years he had worked for the Conservatives in Opposition where his bosses included – choicely – not only Mr Davis but also the Europhile Dominic Grieve. In the 2010 election result, he doubled the Tories’ majority in Esher.          Dominic Raab leaves 10 Downing Street after being appointed as Brexit Secretary on MondayHe was soon impressing Westminster with his Commons performances and became a justice minister in the Cameron government. When Mrs May became PM she inexplicably dropped him from ministerial office, but she brought him back a year later as a justice minister. Word at the Commons is that Mrs May was a little scared of him.In the Cameroon modernising years, Mr Raab was pro-gay marriage but spoke out boldly – some would say bravely – against unreasonably militant feminists, saying that they could be ‘amongst the most obnoxious bigots’. That created a mighty to-do among bien pensants, but Raab stuck to his argument that positive discrimination against young men was exactly that – discriminatory – and the opposite of meritocracy.A few months ago he managed to find himself in the newspapers when his diary secretary was alleged to be working as a call-girl (rest assured, Mr Raab is a happily married father). But it was what she told an undercover reporter that almost caused more controversy.She said her boss ordered the same combination of food for lunch from Pret a Manger every day: namely, a chicken caesar and bacon baguette, a superfruit salad and a watermelon smoothie. The 820 calories in question – which the minister denied eating every day – became so notorious that they were called the Dominic Raab Special.Whatever the truth about his lunchtime favourite, he may have rather a lot else on his plate in the coming weeks. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccf8539ce2e447bdcb694638265dca13fff0738/0_147_4823_2895/master/4823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0da848639a0223d7238bfa83e983bab2","title":"les rencontres darles review photography festival","story":"From ancient African spirituality to the futuristic realm of the transhuman, the much-loved photography festival was still visionary despite its restricted spaceThe metal exterior of the 200ft tall Frank Gehry building glows bright gold in the setting sun. A beacon of the new Arles, this is the home of the billionaire art collector Maja Hoffmann’s Luma Foundation. With 100,000 square feet of space to show contemporary conceptual art, the foundation is aiming to attract the international art jet set. The unspoken question on everyone’s lips is: whither photography in this glamorous new world? The answer is that Les Rencontres – the most famous and best-loved photography festival in the world – is surviving, albeit in much reduced circumstances. The main problem is lack of space, with the Parc des Ateliers – where huge disused train sheds used to house the bulk of the images – now being remade beneath the Gehry tower as a hub for conceptual art. Impressive as the Luma Foundation’s ambition is, it is being pursued with a Darwinian thrust that may yet be the festival’s undoing. The signs are already there. While Gilbert and George: the Great Exhibition (1971-2016) invites visitors into a palatial, air-conditioned space, for an extra charge, many of the year’s most interesting contemporary photography shows are housed in semi-derelict buildings repurposed as galleries. It is difficult not to read this as a metaphor. All this may change, of course, when the Luma project is completed in a few years and some balance is reached. But for now, Les Rencontres seems a little cramped and makeshift, a far cry from the halcyon days of huge spaces and bravura guest curators such as Martin Parr and Nan Goldin. In the centre of Arles, this year the big spaces were given over to Robert Frank, Raymond Depardon and Paul Graham under the collective heading America Great Again! All very familiar, all very male. The Frank exhibition, Sidelines, is an interesting glimpse of a master’s formative years before The Americans made him a legend. Depardon’s vision of America, equally monochrome, s 1968 to 1999, and through the prism of traditional documentary photography, even the tumult of the anti-Vietnam protest era and the Machiavellian machinations of President Nixon now seem impossibly distant and almost quaint, given all that has happened since Trump.  More resonant still is Paul Graham’s The Whiteness of the Whale, which comprises three series: American Night (1998-2002), a shimmer of possibility (2004-06), and The Present (2009-11). Graham’s gaze sits somewhere between documentary and tentative conceptualism: his big, colour images are haunting in their quiet, often intimate, observation of American people going about their daily business against a suggestion that all is not well. American Night, where some of the large-scale images are rendered so pale as to be opaque, evokes a country in which racial ision, poverty and exclusion are suggested in the often intimate, everyday scenes his curious eye selects and transforms. His street subjects, sometimes caught in arrestingly intimate closeup, seem beaten by the sheer doggedness of their lives. In this context, Paul Fusco’s elegiac series, The Train: RFK’s Last Journey, seems even more poignant. It is the perfect execution of a single brilliant idea: shots of the mourners who lined the railway tracks as Robert Kennedy’s body was transported by train from New York to Washington after his assassination in 1968. Fusco’s images are contrasted with photographs and home movies made by the actual mourners and collected by Dutch artist Reinjelle Terpstra in his project The People’s View (2014-18). An inspired pairing that still carries an echo of a moment when America seemed to be mourning its lost future.  As astute readers may have noticed, all the above artists are male. Likewise Jonas Bendiksen, whose funny and disturbing series The Last Testament, about contemporary messiahs, drew reverent crowds to the suitably sepulchral Eglise Sainte-Anne. The relative lack of female photographers and curators was a talking point amid the somewhat muted buzz of the usual Arles’ late-night social buzz. It seems almost inexcusable that no one picked up on this while programming the festival.  In La Croisière, one of the repurposed buildings, Cristina de Middel and Bruno Morais made productive use of the makeshift space to present Midnight at the Crossroads, which evoked the historical roots and contemporary practice of African spirituality in Benin, Cuba, Brazil and Haiti. Merging documentary and fiction to dramatic effect, the series is a study in sustained atmospherics as much as anything else. Images of mysterious sites, rituals and robed practitioners bring an often suppressed, but still powerful, world of devotion to light. Implicit throughout is the unseen presence of Èsù, “ of the alleys, the crossroads and the markets”. Let’s hope he is guarding Les Rencontres. It was a surreal experience to leave behind the shadow-world of ancient African spirituality and enter the futuristic realm of the transhuman as captured by Matthieu Gafsou’s often alarming series H+. Faith in science and technology has displaced belief in the ine, with the predominant goal being immortality. Gafsou wilfully avoids context in his survey of the new possibilities for human enhancement currently being explored by the transhuman movement. He has photographed bodies carrying implanted microchips to increase intelligence, super foods to build a perfect immune system, huge tanks where organs lie in deep frozen suspension awaiting a future in which no one falls ill, ages or dies. Disturbing and darkly fascinating, H+ is a highlight of the festival.  Elsewhere, Les Rencontres seemed to reflect the ongoing confusion of contemporary politics – and photography practice. A Pillar of Smoke, a group show that traces the outlines of contemporary Turkish photography, is by turns exhilarating and confusing. Likewise The Family of No Man, an open-call, all-female exhibition that is a kind of scattergun broadside against the male-dominated mainstream festival and, as its name suggests, a contemporary takedown of Edward Steichen’s similarly exclusive 1955 exhibition, The Family of Man. Both shows are characterised by their energy and their unevenness. Altogether more crowd-pleasing is The Hobbyist: Looking for Passion, which examines how hobbyists have reflected their pastimes and obsessions though photography since the 1960s. Perhaps I was suffering from image-overload, but I found it as confusing as it was illuminating. It was wonderful, though, to see Spaniard Joan Colom’s transfixing and little-seen colour portraits of the denizens of the Barrio Chino red-light district in 1990s Barcelona. Exhibited alongside Jane Evelyn Atwood’s evocative images of 1970s Pigalle, they spoke of a lost world of transgressive sexuality and prostitution as it was played out on the harsh, working-class streets of the city. Nostalgia also hung over an exhibition of press and police archive photographs entitled 1968, What a Story! The student uprising of May 1968 is played out in shot after shot of stone-throwing protesters, wreathed in teargas, facing les flics. One of the faces of the protest, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, appeared in the amphitheatre to expound on the power of politics and the photographic image. Revealingly, no one asked him how we might reclaim both – and Arles.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

The National Infrastructure Assessment is a once-a-parliament affair from a body that was created to save us from the deadly combination of politicians’ machismo and the electoral cycle.More prosaically, the National Infrastructure Commission’s job is to inject long-term strategic thinking into the critical business of building important stuff. Its first report contains a devastating conclusion: the government should drop its obsession with building more and more nuclear power stations.The NIC still imagines one more nuclear plant, on top of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, before 2025, but the contrast with the government’s current approach is stark. Energy ministers for a decade have told us that a “resurgence” in new nuclear in the UK is the only way to keep the lights on while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions. As for the hideous costs of Hinkley on our energy bills for 35 years, we were told they must be swallowed to get the nuclear show up and running again. Another six plants could be needed, it has been claimed.Sir John Armitt, the NIC’s chairman, has cut through this cultish logic with admirable ease. There is no need to rush with nuclear because “during the next 10 years we should get a lot more certainty about just how far we can rely on renewables,” he says.Well, quite. The major development in the energy market in the past decade has been the plunging price of renewables. Costs have been cut faster and further than assumed in Whitehall. In last autumn’s capacity auction, the “strike prices” for two big offshore windfarms came in at £57.50 per megawatt hour and a third at £74.75. These figures – the guaranteed price for the electricity generated – compare to Hinkley’s £92.50.The next generation of nuclear plants really will be cheaper, the industry likes to claim, yet its boasts tend to rely on the assumption that a bigger slice of the construction risks can be shoved on to the government’s balance sheet. Even if such “clever” financing models were deemed desirable, however, they don’t change the basic facts. From a purely financial perspective, offshore wind and solar are the cheapest bets.Some “baseload” nuclear may still be required for security of supply but the NIC’s conclusion merely sounds like common sense: the UK shouldn’t rush to tie itself to an expensive nuclear future it should back renewables to continue becoming cheaper and it should see what developments arrive from the world of storage technology, which could change the game again.The government, when it gets back to governing, needs to respond. Its mania for new nuclear plants has looked out-of-date, wrong-headed and unnecessarily expensive for ages. Now even its own infrastructure adviser agrees. A U-turn is required.A decade ago Mothercare had 425 stores in the UK. By 2014 the figure was 220. Today it is 140 and, on the latest restructuring plan, the group will be down to its last 77 within a year, at which point it will supposedly emerge as a lean and restructured business that is “fit for purpose”, as the interim chairman, Clive Whiley, puts it.His predecessor, Alan Parker, promised the same “sustainable” outcome many times over the years, so shareholders should approach with extreme caution. On the plus side, the latest rejig was accompanied by hard talk about £19m of cost savings from rent reductions, store costs and central overheads as the CVA process is completed. Those savings will plainly help.The missing ingredient, however, is firm evidence that Mothercare can back win consumers in the age of Amazon and stronger competition from supermarkets. The chief executive Mark Newton-Jones’s sermon about “exciting” plans to “revitalise the brand” has also been heard many times.The share price has sunk so low there’s no point in shareholders throwing a tantrum. The £32.5m fundraising, which will double the number of shares in issue, is underwritten, so the company will get its cash whatever happens.

But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and  Chris LeslieOn Water Row, sandwiched between Glasgow’s former shipyards and the dark waters of the River Clyde, it would be easy to miss the showpeople’s yards.Look closely and you’ll see a carved dancing bear, chained to an old telegraph pole, or behind high metal railings the folded-up fairground rides waiting repair – tantalising snatches of “the shows”.But now some are saying the pace of 21st-century development is pushing them out of the city.Their concerns are focused around Govan, where regeneration plans are threatening two large extended families. Glasgow city council claims that proposals for Water Row will bring new housing, jobs, businesses and leisure facilities to the community, which undoubtedly needs investment.To some, however, the proposals are hard to stomach as they will mean eviction. Teresa Johnstone was born on Water Row into the Wilmot family, a well-known family of Scottish showpeople. She married and raised her sons here, and has lived on this neat and tidy site for 29 years, paying rent and council tax. Now a £17m development is planned for the site of her home, so she will be relocated.The council says it has been “in regular dialogue with the representatives of the families, offering the full support of the council to move to alternative and fully serviced sites in the local area and beyond”. Johnstone, however, says her family only found out days before the public announcement. It took months to get anything in writing, and though a potential relocation site has now been suggested, there is still no firm solution on the table.Jimmy Stringfellow, who lives in the next yard along with his wife, Diane, their son and grandchildren, is also on tenterhooks. He is currently challenging an eviction notice he was served this year.“It feels like a game of ping pong,” he says of the communication with officials over relocation. “And I can tell you it doesn’t half pong. We’re an endangered species but there is more protection for butterflies and crocodiles than there is for us. It feels like they don’t want us. We are being shoved out of the way and into corners.”Showpeople offer an important service, she says, providing entertainment at galas, fair holidays, fetes, festivals and firework displays, and that should be recognised.“We are governed by the Showman’s Guild – we can’t just pull into derelict land, we’d get fined,” says Johnstone. “We pay council tax, we are regulated. And yet we are getting treated like second-class citizens. We should have equality.”Follow the winding River Clyde a few miles east and you’ll get to Cuningar Loop, a gated site where rows of chalets with neat front gardens house around 100 people. Yard owner Norman Thomas claims the Govan situation has left people rattled. Thomas bought this land, next to a filled-in rubbish dump, 28 years ago. He worries that he doesn’t ultimately control it – a few years ago, South Lanarkshire council tried to move these showpeople to a new site. The plan was only abandoned due to rising costs. Fresh in Thomas’ memory, too, is a relocation programme prior to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, when 22 yards in South Dalmarnock home to some 600 people, were earmarked for redevelopment.After much consultation only 75 chalets were affected. The regeneration partnership, known as Clyde Gateway, says it is proud of the way it managed the programme to “ensure that every family or business affected would have options” for being rehoused. It developed two new yards and invested in improvements to existing sites. Next to the site, Clyde Gateway has developed a popular woodland park, and recently the British Geological Survey put in planning permission for a geo-thermal research site. Both organisations are at pains to explain how carefully they have consulted with the community, but trust isn’t won easily here.“We were brought up to be proud that we are from an entrepreneurial background that goes back for generations, and that we are all very community focused,” says Thomas’ son Royce, who returned here with his husband after studying at university in London. “But there is stigma. So when we hear about what’s happening in Govan yes, we do worry.”The community feels its entire way of life is under threat. In a wagon at the bottom of the site, Preston Irvin is painstakingly airbrushing a children’s ride. He loves this life, but says it is far from easy. There are ever-stricter licensing regulations and soaring costs fairs are shorter and competition for punters fierce. In the winter, he takes on other jobs to help him survive until the season starts again.“Years ago it was different,” he says. “I don’t want to give up this way of life but it is getting harder and harder.” He, too, fears for the future. “You’re think you’re settled. Maybe that could change. And not everyone is happy to have a fairground way of life on their doorstep.”A short drive away in Parkhead lives illustrator and researcher Mitch Miller. There are no development plans for his small, traditional site either, but Miller knows it is a precarious way of life. “What’s happening in Govan can happen anywhere.”He moved back several years ago after living in a Glasgow tenement, where he missed the community. His father, who still runs hook-a-duck stalls and other sideshows, likes to tell stories of acrobat ancestors, boxing grandmothers and trick riding aunties.Miller is one of a small group of campaigners who have written to local politicians with their concerns about the lack of due process in Govan. He hopes a solution will help others fare better in the face of future development.“We are not asking for the moon but for the procedure to be followed,” he says. “Those families have a claim to be there. They put a community in when there was nothing else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dda3de19e3f043429f5c47c342b198b8f664914/0_170_5112_3067/master/5112.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4695b9e8af6d72efcc3a1ab942e1f18c","title":"the guardian view on climate change a global heatwave","story":"The British are parochial about weather. It is our cherished grievance, not to be shared with foreigners. Perhaps it is the fact that our weather tends to come from the west, across the Atlantic, and not from our neighbours in Europe (unless it’s a “beast from the east”) which reinforces the belief that our weather is a uniquely British problem. But though we cannot say definitively that the current heatwave is caused by carbon emissions, it fits the pattern of long-term changes that we call climate. It is part of a global phenomenon, even if not the most important part. The really significant change is happening in eastern Siberia at the moment, where a completely unprecedented heatwave is warming that Arctic coastline, with consequences that are unpredictable in detail but surely bad on a large scale.Siberia is a vulnerable point in the global climate system for two reasons. The obvious one is the Arctic ice. The more that melts, the less remains to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. Water, being dark, absorbs heat better so there is a feedback loop set up. That is worrying, but it may be less dangerous than the feedback caused by the melting of the layer formerly known as the permafrost. This releases carbon and methane – more methane will be released from under the warming sea – and both are powerful greenhouse gases. Instability in the Arctic affects the whole of the northern hemisphere, as it increases the chances that the northern jet stream, will stick for longer than usual in a particular pattern. When that happens, the weather stops changing in the affected areas. Heatwaves are prolonged and so are cold snaps. Extremes of every sort, such as the rains in Japan which have killed more than 100 people, become more likely. What seems to be happening at the moment is that a fixation of the jet stream has produced the heatwave in Siberia as well as ours here. Again, this is yet another feedback loop. This is a heatwave which makes further, hotter heatwaves more likely in the future.Although there is enormous uncertainty about the exact progression of climate change, the direction of travel is entirely clear. This is a problem that demands coordinated global action. The Paris accords are an effort in that direction, but they are being sabotaged. British, or English nationalism about the weather is mildly comical but the selfish and ignorant attitudes of the Trump administration are purely tragic for the whole world. Still, there is more chance of changing the climate than there is of changing the mind of Mr Trump. While the US continues to sulk on climate change and to be driven by short-term imperatives of profit, the best any British government can do is to prepare for a change in the weather here. In 20 years’ time, the heat of the last week will no longer be news. It will be routine. The effect on old people, on schools, and on hospitals will be grim. A responsible government would be planning for this perfectly foreseeable outcome. Ours, however, is otherwise \u0026nbsppreoccupied."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def8ca74ee1b1ce1732bbc2e6e026876606ee376/0_168_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d57d2729b598abf187022a1f72c0d1f","title":"one in three fish caught never makes it to the plate un report","story":"Global fish production is at record levels thanks to fish farming, says the UN FAO, but much is wasted and many species are worryingly overfishedOne in three fish caught around the world never makes it to the plate, either being thrown back overboard or rotting before it can be eaten, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.Its biannual report on the state of the world’s fisheries, released on Monday, also shows that total fish production has reached a record high thanks to more fish farming, particularly in China, with over half the fish eaten in the world now coming from aquaculture.Fish are a crucial source of nutrition for billions of people around the globe, but overfishing is rife in some regions, with two-thirds of species overexploited in the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Southeast Pacific. Previous analyses that include estimates for illegal fishing indicate that wild fish stocks are declining faster than FAO data suggest and that half the world’s oceans are now industrially fished. “Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth, demonstrating that the fisheries sector is crucial in meeting the FAO’s goal of a world without hunger and malnutrition,” said José Graziano da Silva, FAO director general. Many challenges remain, he said, but recent initiatives to crack down on illegal fishing will mark “a turning point” in favour of long-term conservation.The FAO report sets out the huge scale of global fishing: it employs 60 million people and there are 4.6m fishing vessels on the planet. This huge effort is worrying in many places, the FAO says, with too many boats chasing too few fish. As a result, the number of species being overfished has trebled in the last 40 years. The report also states that climate change will drive fish away from warm tropical waters, where nations are often especially reliant on seafood, towards more temperate regions.Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe, said huge improvements were needed across the fishing industry. “Food waste on a hungry planet is outrageous,” he said. “The fact that one-third of all fish caught goes to waste is a huge cause for concern for global food security.” On overfishing, particularly in the Mediterranean, he said: “We know the situation, we have the solutions: setting fish catch limits to scientific advice and stopping illegal and destructive fishing. All we’re missing is political action.” Gustavsson added: “Aquaculture is far from being the magic bullet, as it is often unsustainable. Using 20m tonnes of fish like mackerel, sardines and anchovies to feed farmed fish instead of people is a blatant waste of food.”Prof Daniel Pauly, at the Sea Around Us research initiative at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has been very critical of previous FAO reports, which he says significantly underestimated the total catch by failing to account for illegal fishing.

Asked whether he was looking forward to playing against Harry Kane in Wednesday’s World Cup semi-final, the Croatia defender said: “He deserves every credit he gets. The last few seasons he has always scored more than 25 goals. He is one of the best strikers in the world but I like to challenge these strikers and to show to everyone that I am one of the best defenders.”Rewind to 22 October, on an autumnal Sunday afternoon at Wembley, and there are 31 minutes on the clock. Lovren glances across to the technical area and sees that it his number being held up. on Liverpool’s substitutes’ board. Kane has already got away from Lovren twice, running in behind to score Tottenham’s first goal and leaving the defender in his wake again to set up a second. Lovren looked lost and totally disoriented. “Ambling about like a man recently winched up off the anaesthetist’s table,” Barney Ronay wrote in these pages .It was uncomfortable to watch at times. Lovren had strayed into that territory where a player becomes a danger to his own team and Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, knew that he had to act. His words after the match felt just as damning as the decision to sub Lovren so early. “If I am involved in this situation on the pitch, then Harry cannot get the ball,” the Liverpool manager said. “It\u0026nbspwouldn’t happen if I was on the pitch – but I am in the middle of the technical area in trainers. Each job is clear but we couldn’t do it.”Lovren is clearly a better footballer than he showed that day and although his time at Anfield has been far from straightforward, by the end of the season it seemed as though the balance had tipped to the point that the good outweighed the bad. Even his biggest critics at Anfield would acknowledge he enjoyed an impressive Champions League campaign, forming a fine centre-back partnership with Virgil van Dijk.Either way Lovren has learned to live with the flak that comes his way. There is a story he tells about his childhood and how, when he was 12 years old, he wrote under the table at his apartment in Croatia: “One day I will be one of the best defenders in the world.”People ridiculed him at school, said he “could not play like a defender”, lacked pace and was one-footed. Lovren, to his credit, used all that negativity as a source of motivation and is entitled to take satisfaction proving so many people wrong. There is no shortage of self-belief burning within him.But even now, at the age of 29 doubts persist – in Croatia as well as on Merseyside – about Lovren’s consistency at the highest level and that nagging feeling that even on a good day there could be a blunder round the corner. It feels strange that a player who has spent the past eight years in the top flight in France and England, being transferred for the best part of £35m while moving from Dinamo Zagreb to Southampton to Liverpool, has represented his country 44 times. He has rarely been a mandatory pick for Croatia and if Vedran Corluka, the former Spurs defender, had not been plagued by injuries Lovren might well have begun this World Cup on the bench.As it happens, Lovren has started every game with the exception of the final group match against Iceland – when Croatia were already through to the last 16 – and only Luka Modric has played more minutes than him here. Not only that but Lovren has acquitted himself well. He has made more clearances and blocks than any other Croatia player, and only Ivan Rakitic and Modric have racked up more passes.Yet, steady as Lovren has looked at this World Cup, it would be understandable in the context of his battles with Kane last season – the striker also scored at Anfield in the corresponding fixture – if there were some concerns at the back of the defender’s mind about coming up against a player who is currently leading the race for the Golden Boot.Publicly at least Lovren insisted he was relishing that prospect and gave the impression that he was more concerned about England’s threat from set pieces. “Look at the players – the smallest is about 6ft 3in,” he said, smiling. “England are one of the favourites to win the World Cup and you have to respect that. But we enjoy to play against big teams, as we showed against Argentina, and have nothing\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsplose.”Croatia have sent Ognjen Vukojevic home from their World Cup delegation after the former international appeared to make pro-Ukraine comments in a video.The video angered many social media users in Russia, which has tense relations with Ukraine and annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The Croatian football federation and Vida have apologised for the video. Both the centre-back and Vukojevic previously played for Dynamo Kyiv, and Vukojevic is now a scout there.Fifa rules prohibit players from making political gestures at the World Cup and the governing body gave Vida a formal warning on Sunday but did not impose a match sanction.Vukojevic said he intended the video as a personal greeting to Ukrainian friends, not as a political statement. “However, I do understand that my statements can be differently interpreted,” he said. “Because of this, I am sorry – and I do apologise to the Russian public, if they perceived my statements like this.”Croatia’s team refused to allow either Mario Mandzukic or Andrej Kramaric to answer questions about the controversy at Monday’s news conference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bf22439870dfc97cac4aae26d530a1d293cda2c/0_31_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48c6835706e76e3438f323681a35f0a4","title":"dele alli england croatia world cup nutmeg modric semi final","story":"Did you ever hear about the time the teenage Dele Alli nutmegged Luka Modric? August 2015, to be precise, for Spurs in the Audi Cup at the Allianz Arena, Munich. Alli was 19, a £5m signing from Milton Keynes Dons thrown into the deep end against Real Madrid, and at least he was courteous enough not to ruffle Modric’s hair, Gazza-style, as he slipped the ball through his opponent’s legs. Modric, he recalls, collared him in the tunnel and called him a “little bugger”. Though the suspicion remains that he might have toned down the language.OK, in the grand scheme of things, it will not count for a lot, nearly three years on, when England meet Croatia in Moscow on Wednesday for a place in a World Cup final. All the same, there was something strangely reassuring, from an English perspective, to hear Alli regaling this story.“I always enjoy a good nutmeg,” was his take. Especially when the person who has just let the ball go through his legs is one of the world’s category-A footballers. To clarify, Alli was not being controversial here or disrespectful in the slightest. Indeed, he also made the point that if England were to win this semi-final a lot would depend on how they managed to deal with Modric’s intelligence on the ball. A nutmeg is a nutmeg. It is not a goal, or a game-defining moment, or a killer pass, or a Champions League medal (of which Modric has four). But it is a reminder, in its own small way, that Alli is not the kind of footballer to suffer any sense of inferiority complex.Another comes when he is asked if he the slightest bit nervous – “excited, not nervous,” he responds – and, again, when it is pointed out to him that he has a pretty impressive record when it comes to scoring on the big occasions. Since 2016, he has scored twice against Manchester United, twice against Manchester City, five times against Chelsea, once against Arsenal and once against Liverpool. Yet Alli wants to make a point of his own. “I score against other teams as well,” he says.England will need this confidence, one imagines, if they are to win their first World Cup semi-final since 1990, six years before Alli was even born, and then return to the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday to see off France or Belgium in the final. Yet it would be a mistake to think that Alli cannot assess himself with a critical eye, too, and by his own admission he is not entirely satisfied with his own World Cup performances.Gareth Southgate identified him for special acclaim after the opening win against Tunisia but that was also the match when the Tottenham Hotspur player damaged a thigh. Alli did not play again in the group stages. He returned for the Colombia game and, though he scored in the 2-0 win over Sweden, he sounded almost apologetic for the way he had performed in England’s quarter-final victory.“I said to my family afterwards that it was weird because I didn’t feel nervous or anything like that. I don’t really ever get nervous anyway. But you know sometimes that you can have games where your control isn’t as good as it should be, or your decision-making isn’t as sharp as normal. I felt like it was one of those games. I’ve spoken to the manager about it and some of my team-mates. I didn’t feel like I was playing as well as I should have been, especially in the first half.“Defensively, I did my job, and did what I needed to do, but I wanted to be on the ball, creating chances and being a threat. I felt like my movement was good but I just wasn’t sharp enough. I didn’t keep the ball as much as I should have. To score ... it gives you a lift. But I’m my own biggest critic. I know I can play better than that.”In keeping with a lot of Southgate’s players, Alli’s air of self-confidence is tinged with the humility that comes from starting in the lower leagues. Here, for example, he has been joking with Danny Welbeck about the night in 2014 when Milton Keynes Dons played Manchester United in the League Cup and won 4-0. The young Alli – to his embarrassment now – asked for Welbeck’s shirt that night and was politely turned down. “I’ve still got my shirt,” he says. “I wasn’t going to give him mine, I just wanted his.”As for the least glamorous surroundings from those days, Alli recalls one night in League One, in February 2015, when Milton Keynes Dons were playing Bradford City on a “horrible pitch” at Valley Parade and “a horrible, aggressive game ... every time I got the ball people would be kicking, swearing.” Bradford won 2-1 and Alli scored the visitors’ goal. What he seems to have forgotten is that the goalkeeper he beat that night was a 20-year-old rookie by the name of Jordan Pickford, on loan from Sunderland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2518380c0a6d30bb6f5fefbf4391e4e42932ca50/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=101899b44140b5dc1a8557b31e9d0e65","title":"mahrez manchester city leicester city record deal guardiola","story":"• Pep Guardiola makes breakthrough in talks with Leicester City• Barcelona confirm £35.5m signing of midfielder ArthurManchester City are optimistic Riyad Mahrez will be unveiled as their £60m record signing by Friday, after they made a breakthrough with Leicester City.The proposed transfer had stalled because Leicester wanted the City winger Patrick Roberts as part of the deal but it is thought that demand has been dropped.

The 31-year-old will almost certainly depart after being loaned out by Guardiola for the past two seasons.Angus Gunn, the No 3 goalkeeper, is set to join Southampton.Barcelona have confirmed the signing of Brazilian midfielder Arthur from Grêmio on a six-year deal.The club said in a statement that the transfer fee for the 21-year-old, who joins immediately, was an initial €31m euros (£27.5m) with an extra €9m (£8m) in “variables”. The total value of the deal is therefore thought to be €40m (£35.5m).Arthur helped Grêmio win the Copa Libertadores last year and arrives just one day after compatriot Paulinho left the Camp Nou and returned to China’s Guangzhou Evergrande.The clubs initially agreed that Arthur would join Barcelona next January, but the departures of Paulinho and Andrés Iniesta – and a serious knee injury suffered by academy player Carles Aleñá – resulted in the transfer being brought forward.

Some resale sites were offering tickets for not much more than face value, starting at about £350, but in other places prices were far more expensive. On Stubhub the cheapest seat on Monday afternoon was £634, with top prices as high as £11,000.Russia has waived its visa requirements for the World Cup, allowing anyone with a ticket, or even the number of somebody else’s ticket, to apply for a Fan ID that can be used instead of a visa to enter the country.England probably have Croatia’s goalkeeper Danijel Subasic to thank for the relative affordability of the least-expensive tickets, after his team prevailed over Russia in the quarter-final on Saturday. An England v Russia semi-final would have attracted enormous interest from home fans and would have almost certainly seen tickets become like gold dust. Instead, some tickets have come back on sale, in addition to tickets purchased by fans of teams such as Germany and Brazil who had expected to see their sides progress to this stage.At an informal ticket resale hub that has sprung up across the street from Fifa’s official ticketing centre in Moscow, a motley band of fans and touts tried to hawk tickets for the two semi-finals and the final. One man offered a pair of category two tickets for the England game for $600 (£450) each, while another had a single ticket on sale for $500. Both prices were only a small mark-up on face value.One England fan who has been at the earlier games and has a ticket to the semi-final was trying to purchase three more for friends in Britain who were planning to travel. His three friends had applied for Fan IDs using his semi-final ticket, said the man, who did not want to give his name. He said he was prepared to spend up to £300 per ticket and had not yet found anything but hinted he would soon raise the price he was willing to pay, as he had found a man selling three tickets together at about £400 each.Many people snapped up tickets on Fifa’s website, though being able to purchase them was largely a matter of luck and patience, as some people reported spending hours refreshing the site without success. The site is set up so that tickets often appear to be available, but users cannot actually purchase them, leading to a ritual of endless browser refreshing in the hope of finally being able to purchase tickets.England’s games so far have been attended by between 2,000 and 5,000 England supporters, with the smaller-than-usual numbers down to a combination of expense and fears of violence in Russia. Now that those fears appear to have been unfounded, and the England team is doing better than almost anyone predicted, many fans are keen to get in on the action.Harriet, a 30-year-old lawyer from London, said she had bought three tickets for the semi-final on the Fifa website on Sunday. The category two tickets were priced about £280 and she was able to buy them after just a few minutes of trying. Her two brothers had bought flights some weeks ago, just in case England reached the semi-finals, and asked her to join at the last minute as they wanted the family to dress up as three lions.She was able to buy last-minute flights on Lufthansa for about £750 return, leaving today and returning on Thursday, and was able to find reasonably priced hotel accommodation. Some packages for England fans, though, were costing £3,000.

He delivered the perfect riposte, that is for sure.Not long after the midfielder missed a vital penalty for Sevilla against Rayo Vallecano, in 2012, sending the ball well wide of the right post, victory denied, his phone beeped. A message landed from Puri, literally a mother-in-law joke. He opened it to see a photo of his golden retriever with a ball at its paw and a message: “Your dog takes better penalties than you do.”Six years on the message was different, skipping a generation. On the morning of Croatia’s last-16 tie against Denmark Rakitic’s Spanish wife, Raquel, told him it would go to penalties and he would score the fifth. He spent the next couple of hours watching videos of Kasper Schmeichel, speaking to Andrej Kramaric too – Schmeichel’s former teammate at Leicester – and that night there he was by the spot, the prophecy fulfilled. Six days later and 1,444km away, it happened again, this time against Russia. All alone once more, only you are never alone standing there. He barely blinked.Rakitic is the first player to have scored the fifth, decisive penalty twice at a World Cup. Each represented a giant step. He told his teammates they had to do it for Luka Modric, who had missed in normal time, but it went far further than that. From Denmark to Russia, Russia to England and a semi-final. “Amazing,” he called it.Rakitic was 10 in 1998, the only other time they got there, watching players he describes as “more than idols” on the TV with his brother Dejan, wearing the Croatia shirts their father, Luka, had bought them, a package arriving one day in the post.He was born and raised in Mohlin, Switzerland, and admits to being a fan of curling. The day he was born Croatia did not officially exist but his father is a Croat, his mother a Croat from Bosnia and Herzegovina, they spoke Croatian at home – one of six languages he speaks – and his idol, Robert Prosinecki, is a Croat. His father played too, a No 4, and set up in Mohlin with the help of a police chief who ran the local football club. Luka sent for his wife soon after and Ivan was born there in 1988.Rakitic was grateful to be shielded from the Balkan war but as he grew he read, listened to stories. “It’s your history, your people,” he said. Although he represented Switzerland at youth level, ultimately he chose Croatia. Slaven Bilic – “mad, but in a good way” – had much to do with it and so did his dad. When Rakitic finished speaking to Bilic and to the Switzerland manager, Köbi Kuhn, on the phone, his dad pacing outside, he opened the door and announced that after careful consideration he was sticking with Switzerland. Luka accepted that, then cried when Rakitic said, “Nah, only joking: it’s Croatia.”There were death threats, letters arriving from furious Swiss supporters, people calling at his home, but Rakitic was clear. “It was a decision of the heart. I didn’t think, ‘With this team I will play more’ that thought process is for club football.”He has played plenty with Croatia – the semi-final against England will be his 98th cap – and has played a huge part too. He has been talked about less than Modric, the man banging on the screen like Benjamin Braddock as Rakitic stood pitchside at the end in Sochi, trying to make sense of it all, but he has been pivotal. “Modric and Rakitic are the best pair of midfielders,” the former Spurs player Vedran Corluka said. That they are presented as a pair is not coincidental. Rakitic calls them brothers and insists Modric is now the greatest player in Croatia’s history.Rakitic has been delighted to play alongside Modric, prepared too to take a step forward when he has been called upon. There are few more back-handed compliments than reliable but, boy, have Croatia been able to rely on himRakitic.It is not chance, that dog-day afternoon apart.At Sevilla Rakitic took the final (fourth) penalty against Betis, their city rivals, when they met in the 2013-14 Europa League. In the final against Benfica in Turin he was down to take the fifth. In the end they did not need him.That was big – Rakitic married into a family of sevillanos, his wife’s grandfather refusing to remove a Sevilla watch during his final days in hospital, dying with it on, and Rakitic once owned a bar near the Betis ground – but this is bigger.He knows that: his father watching, an entire nation watching, wearing the shirt he refused to take off 20 years ago now, sleeping in it, living in it. “For a country like Croatia, it’s amazing to be among the final four,” he says. “We want to keep enjoying this. We don’t want to stop now. But we don’t want to put more pressure on ourselves with 98. It’s incredible what they did and that generation are more than heroes for us.”The pressure is intense, never more than on that walk from the halfway line when teammates are begging you to please, please, please score and every step seems an eternity. Yet, on the outside at least, he walked calmly into the next round, taking Croatia with him, making history. It is more than penalties too, there is something in that idea that defines him well beyond the spot, the safety in knowing he is there, when needed and what is needed.Rakitic somehow still remains underrated, relatively unnoticed despite the stage on which he plays. In the under-16s at Basel he scored 48 goals in 17 games from central midfield but soon moved back.He has been a No 10, a No 4, a No 6 and a No 8, the player who Roma’s famous sporting director Monchi said could do his job and of whom Monchi’s assistant at Sevilla, Victor Orta, said: “He’s so intelligent, able to adapt and humble enough to change position.”At Sevilla he became the first foreign captain since Diego Maradona.Unai Emery described him as a man of values, “good for the unity of the team” and played him as an attacking midfielder and a defensive midfielder: their best player in both positions, his role rotated by the game, according to his team’s needs. In his last season, having provided 15 goals and 17 assists, he led them to the Europa League title, was named man of the match in the final. The following year at Barcelona, which finished with a treble and a goal in the Champions League final, he said: “If we have to run 10km for Neymar, Messi and Suárez, that’s fine.”Last season, when, he says, the discovery that he is celiac means he feels physically fitter than ever, he has played under a different manager in a different style and he has adapted again, becoming everything to every man.Alongside Sergio Busquets, sometimes central, sometimes to the right, he has been holding midfielder, driving midfielder and ball-playing midfielder all in the same match, adapting as circumstances dictated. That is not just being able to adapt, it is also about knowing when to adapt.Not that it was perfect and Rakitic is critical. “We know we can play better. We didn’t have the control of the game we wanted and we have to fix that,” he says.But, still, it is the semi-final, where his country has been once before. “This is the best Rakitic has played for the national team,” says Zlatko Dalic, the manager. “It is a continuation of his great season with Barcelona. He means a lot to the whole team and I think he and Modric together are the best midfielders at the tournament. Rakitic is playing the best he has played in his career and his confidence is high – we saw that with the two decisive penalties.”So now here they are, one game from the World Cup final. “We cannot pass up this historic opportunity,” says the man whose dog takes a better penalty. Well, he used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b63f94bcf39091564dd154fc3636ee3ed1a5877/114_54_2876_1726/master/2876.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78cc6e330e3b0d122fa800ee5cfbcf8c","title":"england team world on side political turmoil world cup","story":"Tories, let’s be clear – distracting everyone by bringing down the government this week, of all weeks, is unacceptableThanks to David Davis and Boris Johnson, England are now one of those World Cup sides that can be described sympathetically as “playing on despite the political turmoil back home”. As the old saying goes: dance like no one’s watching, love like you’ve never been hurt and play a World Cup like your shitshow of a government is about to collapse itself and plunge your country further into the mire.And you know what? Depending on how much barely charted territory you can handle – England are in the semi-finals of the actual World Cup, after all – it feels great to be that side. Those guys typically pick up a lot of secondary support from people whose own national teams have already gone out. In the bars of Rio, I hope people are beginning to say: “I’m rooting for England now – it’s so sad what their dreadful politicians have done to them. But, you know, in the middle of it all, they just want to play football. It’s a very pure, special thing. They really rise above it with their magical, spellbinding corners. They remind you why it’s called the beautifully planned game. Yup, come on England! WE’RE ALL ENGLISH NOW.” All that in Portuguese, obviously.Furthermore, I trust England are now the subject of a welter of patronising articles across the foreign press, explaining how the hopes of a once-proud nation have been dashed by Etonian warlordslying populistscorrupt bribers, and are now telescoped entirely on to this plucky squad. (Before we go much further, I must apologise to all the other home nations for this analogy – at the same time as offering the caveat that it is, after all, just an analogy. We’re at the business end of a World Cup with no football for 36 hours: be prepared to suck up a lot of tenuous analogies).Anyway, how do these foreign editorials run? “All eyes are on rebel strongman Boris Johnson,” a leader in the Nigeria Tribune might put it, “once beloved in his tribal lands but whose reputation has oxidised as rapidly as one of the vanity projects to which he siphoned vast sums of public money.”“As allegations of democratic corruption swirl,” a foreign correspondent for one of the Mexico City papers could have it, “the slum bars of this humbled nation throb with a pride against the odds. ‘It’s coming home’, runs the local chant, that can be heard from shanty to chic apartment in this otherwise ided country. What kind of home it could return to is, alas, another matter …” And so on for another four thousand words.Throwing this particular cultural moment into even sharper relief is the UK’s longtime refusal to realise it had become one of the true basket cases of international life – something that can surely no longer be ignored. Yet even a couple of weeks ago it still felt like something that happened to other countries. “For many years,” the former Argentina forward Jorge Valdano reflected of his homeland in a wonderful article for the , “football made up for our long political, social and economic decline.”Incredible, when you think about it, that England are close to being the sort of thing that might be routinely said about them. England! Until literally four minutes before this World Cup, there was a corner of so many foreign fields that was forever a toxic England exit. Charleroi, Shizuoka, Lisbon, Gelsenkirchen, Bloemfontein, São Paolo. The fact we’d gone out of Euro 2016 to Iceland a mere four days after going out of Europe to Brexit was frequently characterised as somehow symbiotic by people such as me. People with deadlines, particularly. Everything was a metaphor for everything else. Indeed, two weeks ago Valdano had begun by ruing the fact you could now say the same about Argentina the football side as you could about Argentina the country: “So many things are wrong with Argentina we do not know what is wrong so much is happening no one knows what is happening.”Same. Except, no – wait! Hilariously and extraordinarily, the football is going OK. It’s going more than OK. It’s going so marvellously OK that whatever happens on Wednesday at the Luzhniki, Gareth Southgate’s England have done enough to be vastly attractive to all sorts of public figures who wish to co-opt their spiritual rebirth.All of which necessitates a popular decree: following the shithousery of the past 24 hours, no Conservatives, at all, are now allowed to attempt to piggyback on the success (or indeed the plucky failure) of the England football side. They are formally banned from even mentioning it. Tories: you all need to realise that this latest self-own is of a wildly different order to Theresa May being tricked into holding up the Hazard Belgium shirt during her visit to Brussels the other week. Sorry to nick your catchphrase, but let US be clear: if you guys collapse the government in the week England could reach its first World Cup final since 1966 – having already diary-clashed Donald Trump’s visit into that same week – you will carry a mark of Cain that will make all of your other marks of Cain look like henna tattoos.I mean, honestly. Shame on the politicians looking at this sweltering hot, heady summer of football and thinking: “Ooh, this would totally be enhanced by a general election”. Really? REALLY? Let us be very clear: stay away from Gareth and stay out of our fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc38bf2f021229ba2a71f755c7a7dd7197caf29/0_881_6730_4038/master/6730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5c19b182326585cdc26c5f4a86827a","title":"anna jones courgette recipes","story":"Try roasting small courgettes in a simple, one-pot dish, or grate and turn into cheesy fritters for a quick and easy light mealNow is the courgette’s time to shine.

As part of the study the team also looked the impact on other measures, including growth and sleep. “An added benefit (of early introduction of solids) is that it seems to confer better sleep for the children,” said Gideon Lack, professor of paediatric allergy at King’s College London, and a co-author of the research.Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Lack and a team of researchers behind the study say while there is a common belief that eating solid food helps a baby to sleep better – with one NHS survey suggesting most mothers give their child food before five months – many sources of advice for new parents, including the NHS and the National Childbirth Trust, recommend that parents should wait until six months before introducing solids. “We believe the most likely explanation for our findings of improved sleep is that that these babies are less hungry” said Lack, adding that solid foods might mean less regurgitation or greater feelings of being full.More than 1300 healthy breastfed three-month-olds were split randomly into two groups in one the babies were exclusively breastfed until they were six months old – as current guidelines recommend – while children in the other group were breastfed and given solid foods, including peanuts, eggs and wheat, from the age of three months, in addition to breastfeeding. After six months babies in both groups were eating a range of solids.The children’s health and behaviour was followed for three years, with their sleep and consumption of solid food tracked by families through questionnaires. While not all babies were kept to their allotted regime, on average, babies who were in the breastfeeding only group were first introduced to solids at around 23 weeks, while those in the other group encountered the foods at around 16 weeks The team found that the more closely parents stuck to the early introduction programme, the stronger the effect. Lack said a crucial finding is that parents who were asked to exclusively breastfeed had almost twice the odds of reporting a serious problem with their child’s sleep than those who were asked to introduce their babies to solid food early.The team did note that the study did not use sensors to monitor infants’ sleep and that parents might have misreported sleeping behaviour because they had previously encountered the idea that babies fed solid foods earlier sleep better.However Professor Amy Brown of Swansea University, whose research includes weaning of babies, said the benefits revealed by the study were “minimal” in real-world terms, and that other research showed no rewards for early introduction of solids.“There is no clear physiological reason why introducing solids foods early would help a baby sleep, especially not for the very small amounts parents were instructed to give in this trial,” she said.Brown urged caution, noting that no difference in waking was seen until after five months, despite one group being introduced to solids from three months, and that self-report of infant sleep by tired parents was unlikely to be precise. Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health welcomed the study, noting the RCPCH currently recommends solid foods are not introduced before four months, but that the evidence base for current advise is more than 10 years old and is currently under review in the UK and EU. “We expect to see updated recommendations on infant feeding in the not too distant future,” she said.Erin Leichman, a senior research psychologist at St Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, and executive director of the Pediatric Sleep Council said while the impact of early introduction of solid foods likely varied across babies, the findings are important. “Results of this study certainly warrant further research on the topic, particularly addressing how long babies continue to breastfeed despite introduction of solids and how parents interact with their babies at bedtime and during the night after a night waking, which can be related to sleep and night wakings,” she said. “At this point, results of this study do not indicate that solids should be introduced early for all babies.” Making the decision about when to introduce solid foods should be one that is family-based, and made with a trusted health-care provider.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61169768b94ac51b6d088baa698bfee8779871a9/0_142_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab02ded2430e577369d170e4262b9af","title":"flying high kids in the uk are wild about energy drinks but how harmful are they","story":"UK children consume energy drinks at a higher rate than kids in any other country in Europe - with a fifth of three-10-year-olds having them regularly. Is this a health risk, or no worse than coffee?When Red Bull launched in the UK in 1994, with its odd, cough-linctus flavour and novel billing as an “energy drink”, students and clubbers went mad for the stuff. The brand quickly became a cheap and legal staple for staying up all night. A quarter of a century later, the energy drinks market is still growing and flooded with Red Bull competitors such as Relentless, Monster Energy and Emerge. And it is no longer just young adults guzzling them to study or rave into the small hours these brands are catnip to children.Energy drinks are classified as soft drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Many brands, however, including Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull (still the world’s bestselling energy drink) contain more than twice that amount. While, at about 300mg per litre, this is less than filter coffee (about 400mg per litre), the drinks are way more quaffable to children. The ESFA say just one can of some brands could exceed their recommended daily caffeine limit for children.Amelia Lake is a reader in public health nutrition at Teeside University and co-author of the 2017 study for which school children were interviewed. “Coffee is very different,” she says. “It’s hot, not necessarily full of sugar and you can’t gulp it down. You can’t have three or four one after another, like you can with these drinks.” With highly palatable flavours such as tropical fruits and blueberry, they are to coffee what alcopops are to vodka.Lake says that the health concerns don’t stop at sugar and caffeine. “There’s the cocktail of the other things in these drinks – the guanine, taurine, various other what are called healthy ingredients. We don’t have a lot of evidence about what the combination does to adults or children.” Taurine is an amino acid found in meat and fish that is claimed to enhance concentration (among its many other biological functions), especially when combined with caffeine and guanine – a stimulant derived from the South American guarana plant.In 2016, Lake and colleagues reviewed the academic literature on energy drinks from Europe and the US. They found associations between consuming the drinks with symptoms including headaches, stomach aches, hyperactivity, insomnia, fatigue and irritation. There were also higher incidences among energy drink fans of injuries, driving violations and road accidents. In the US in 2010-11, the National Poison Data System received 4,854 calls about energy drink cases. Almost half involved children under six years old, but it was among older children that more grave effects such as cardiac rhythm disturbances and hypertension were reported.Furthermore – perhaps indicating that the drinks are seen as a legal high for children – several studies in the review found strong links between choosing energy drinks, sensation seeking and other self-destructive behaviours such as binge-drinking, smoking and substance abuse, along with problems with behavioural regulation and metacognitive skills (such as planning and problem-solving). Lake is keen to point out, however, that, short of conducting unethical experiments that involve dosing children up with caffeine in a laboratory, we are having to make do with associations rather than finding any proof of causation.According to EU labelling guidelines, soft drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about the high caffeine content and state that they are not recommended for children. But wouldn’t this make the drinks even more irresistible to children? “I don’t think it’s a silver bullet,” says Lake, “but it’s a good first step.” Some of her research was prompted by concerned parent groups. “There was confusion around who and what these drinks are for, with incidences of children having them for breakfast,” says Lake, lamenting that even though “the cans say they’re not for children, we sell them to children anyway”. Energy drink consumption by children in the UK is the highest in Europe.Earlier this year, the major UK supermarkets committed to not selling the drinks to under-16s, but convenience stores and vending machines are ubiquitous. The government has now proposed a ban on selling the drinks to under-16s, to combat childhood obesity. “If you look wider,” says Lake, “other countries have been ahead of this curve for a while now. Some countries have outright bans some have banned sales to under-18s.”The health secretary has also proposed a 9pm watershed for junk-food advertising, but the way that energy drinks are promoted is many-tentacled. The brands have forged strong associations with gaming, extreme sports, Formula One racing, clubbing and music, using social media, event sponsorship and web content. As Beckett says, the marketing is “very attractive to young people, with a lot of social media, YouTube channels ... Monster has been very savvy advertising through the gaming world. These are whole other areas of a marketing universe that’s on the radar of young people, but not their parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

As well as being one of the country’s most gifted composers of the last half century, he has also been an unstinting champion and mentor of successive generations of his colleagues, someone who arguably did more to promote the cause of new music here than any single figure since William Glock in the 1960s and 70s.His knowledge of the repertory, especially from the beginning of the 20th century to the present day, was more extensive, and more detailed, than that of anyone I’ve ever met, but his own music was firmly rooted in modernism – in Stravinsky and Scriabin, Debussy, early Berg and Webern. Its affiliations were clear but it never seemed remotely derivative, with its stylistic strands woven into a wonderfully flexible, iridescent musical idiom, in which every instrumental and vocal line seemed perfectly imagined and immaculately shaped. Each work was a miracle of conciseness and packed in more musical content than many composers managed to include in pieces five times as long the only problem was that in the end there was so little of this exquisite music.There was some compensation from his exemplary readings of other composers’ music, a repertoire that extended at least from Elgar to the present day, performances that were always wonderfully precise, and texturally immaculate. But it was his interpretations of contemporary music that were particularly prized, and composers from Henze and Elliott Carter (whose definitive interpreter and close friend he became in the final decades of the centenarian’s life), through George Benjamin and Mark-Anthony Turnage, to Tansy Davies and Helen Grime, remained hugely grateful to the care he invariably took over their work.As always with great conductorcomposers – Pierre Boulez is the other classic example in our time – there hangs the question of whether their success as a conductor left them with too little time to compose the music they might have done, or whether a burgeoning conducting career offered a useful escape route at a time when they had reached a creative impasse in their own work. With Boulez the latter was almost certainly true with Knussen, I’m not sure the answer is quite so obvious. He certainly never stopped composing and and planning new projects, instead it was his almost pathological self-criticism that proved suffocating in the long term it seems as if his teenage precocity as a composer who had received encouragement from Britten and had his First Symphony performed by the London Symphony Orchestra at the age of 16 (he conducted the premiere himself), and especially the subsequent publicity it attracted provided profoundly inhibiting that symphony was very firmly withdrawn (though before he reached 30 he had composed two more, which remain in his work list).That reticence to let pieces go also extended to recordings he edited, and to articles he sometimes agreed, reluctantly, to write, and only seemed to intensify as Knussen got older. In the last two decades of his life he released only a handful of miniatures and just two substantial scores, a Violin Concerto, and the Requiem he composed in memory of his former wife, Sue. Other more or less finished works were kept stubbornly under wraps – there is an almost complete 25-minute orchestral show-piece Cleveland Pictures, while a cello concerto and a work for piano and orchestra intended for his friend Peter Serkin were both left in varying states of incompleteness. But over the years Knussen’s admirers learnt to be grateful for even the tiniest pieces, most recently the shimmering, eight-minute setting of Japanese haiku, O Hotogisu!, heard at last year’s Aldeburgh festival, supposed to be the first instalment, so Knussen said then, of a projected concerto for soprano and flute.Knussen’s connections with Aldeburgh extended back to his childhood, when his father played the double bass for the first performances of Britten’s church parable, Curlew River, and he remained closely associated with the festival to the end of his life. It was fitting that his final public appearances were at this year’s festival, at which he conducted both the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Aldeburgh Festival Ensemble what I’ll remember most of all from that last concert was his performance of a rarity, the ravishing incidental music Debussy wrote for a reading of poems by his friend Pierre Louÿs – it was a sequence of tiny fragments, each of which gleamed as brightly as Knussen’s own musical gems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093918810094ef67979b9ffbb2c121c772af257d/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e320cb7efc7bf91a0acc74b24813954","title":"labour poised to vote down brexit deal","story":"Party says May’s agreement must meet Keir Starmer’s six tests as Jeremy Corbyn tears into PM’s strategy Labour could be prepared to vote against Theresa May’s final Brexit deal, even if it means walking through voting lobbies with Conservative hard Brexiters, with party sources insisting the government cannot force a no-deal situation.The party has said it will vote against the final Brexit deal unless it meets shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer’s six tests on protection of jobs and rights – in practice, highly unlikely. “We will vote down the deal unless it meets our six tests,” a party source said. “Even if we are walking down the corridor with Tory Brexiters, we are still voting on the lines we have set ourselves.”The source said Labour did not believe defeating any final Brexit agreement would set a course for the UK to leave with no deal, which they said was made clear by the “meaningful vote” amendment to the EU withdrawal bill. “She cannot treat a defeated deal as an endorsement of no deal. Two-thirds of the Tory party would oppose it,” the source said. Speaking in the Commons earlier, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tore into the prime minister’s strategy, saying jobs and investment were now “a sub-plot in the Tory party civil war” after the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson.Writing for the , Starmer said there was an “irreconcilable ide within the Conservative party” and the impasse could no longer be resolved as an internal Conservative party debate.“The agreement struck at Chequers last Friday is flawed in many respects, but at least it appeared to be the first realisation by the prime minister that the approach she adopted two years ago was wrong,” he said. “Her red lines began to yield just a bit. But even this modest shift has proved too much for some in the cabinet and the Conservative party.”In the Commons, May was quick to raise Labour’s own internal isions with Corbyn. “He talks about resignations, can I just remind him, I think he’s had 103 resignations from his frontbench, so I’ll take no lectures from him,” she said. Some Brexit-backing Labour MPs, including Frank Field, welcomed the Chequers’ deal in the Commons on Monday, saying May should now “seek support from elected leaders in Europe, rather than bureaucrats in Brussels”.Downing Street has calculated it will need Labour MPs if the deal has a chance of passing in November. It began laying the groundwork on Monday when opposition MPs were invited to a briefing on the Chequers proposal, scheduled to be presented by the Downing Street chief of staff, Gavin Barwell. Starmer encouraged Labour MPs to attend to make their criticism of the deal known.Barwell never made it to the meeting, one of the first signs that Boris Johnson’s resignation as foreign secretary was imminent. Instead, the presentation was led by the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, and Jonathan Black, one of the directors at the cabinet office’s Europe unit. The committee room in the Houses of Parliament was crammed with peers and MPs but, just minutes into the briefing, it descended into chaos when word of Johnson’s resignation emerged. MPs leaving the room said they were convinced that Lidington had not known that Johnson had resigned while the briefing was ongoing. “There was a moment during the presentation when it flashed on everyone’s phones, everyone burst out laughing. And then someone showed him the message,” one said. Lidington was tight-lipped as he left the room.“What a joke, what a joke,” one senior Labour MP muttered on the way out.Another described it as “the most surreal meeting ever” as they left the room. “They are presenting a deal which is collapsing in front of our eyes. The projector doesn’t work. All anyone is talking about is Boris. It’s like The Thick of It.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66fde1b6fc2f1cf03149457d38433b6b4bdb5932/0_104_2814_1688/master/2814.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33b4e132a21d028898a327c5dab8134","title":"theresa may says tory dissent could send jeremy corbyn into no 10","story":"Tories warned to fall into line or risk handing keys of No 10 to Labour leaderPolitics live – news and reaction to Boris Johnson’s resignationTheresa May has warned hardline Brexiters to fall into line or risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn after Boris Johnson became the second cabinet minister to resign in 24 hours, claiming Britain was “headed for the status of colony”.After a dramatic day of twists and turns in Westminster, the prime minister addressed Conservative MPs for an hour, issuing a stark warning that ided parties lose elections and telling her party that “to lead is to decide”.She then returned to Downing Street to fill the gaps left on the government benches by several resignations, sparked by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who stepped down late on Sunday night.“If we don’t pull together, we risk the election of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister,” one cabinet minister said, summarising what was said at the meeting. “At least half a dozen people made that point and the prime minister responded, too – what is good for the country is a Conservative government.”Earlier, Downing Street announced Johnson’s resignation as foreign secretary, just minutes before May addressed MPs about the softer Brexit plan agreed at Chequers on Friday.Johnson had been due to host a summit about the western Balkans on Monday afternoon but was instead holed up in his official residence with close advisers, considering his position. In a strongly worded resignation letter, he warned that the current Brexit plan meant Britain was “truly headed for the status of colony” and accused the prime minister of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering above them”.On Monday evening, Johnson was replaced as foreign secretary by Jeremy Hunt, who in turn was replaced as health secretary by Matt Hancock, as the prime minister embarked on a reshuffle to shore up her position.Both men have proven their loyalty to May in recent months. Hunt recently won a significant increase in resources for the NHS after a standoff with the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and is widely regarded as a potential future leadership candidate.As the flamboyant public face of the Vote Leave campaign, Johnson’s departure deepened the sense of crisis in Downing Street, and increased the chances that May could face a vote of no confidence in the coming days.If 48 Conservative MPs write letters of no confidence to the chair of the backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, she would face an immediate vote, but he made clear on Monday night that point had not been reached.Many of the prime minister’s supporters believe she would win a contest and cement her authority but May would face a leadership challenge if she lost, with Johnson among the potential candidates.Asked whether May would contest a no confidence vote, a Downing Street source said simply: “Yes.”Asked whether May was confident that the rest of her cabinet backed the negotiating position agreed at Chequers, which is due to be fleshed out in a white paper later this week, he added: “There is no reason to think otherwise.”The carefully choreographed meeting last week resulted in a deal May believed her cabinet had signed up to, which would create a “UK-EU free trade area” for goods, governed by a “common rule book”.But Davis’s resignation, followed by his number two at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, shattered that truce and put pressure on Johnson to follow suit.In his resignation letter, Johnson said: “On Friday, I acknowledged that my side of the argument were too few to prevail, and congratulated you on at least reaching a cabinet decision on the way forward. As I said then, the government now has a song to sing. The trouble is that I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.”In her equally pointed reply, the prime minister said: “If you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal, in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.” She added that she was “sorry, and a little surprised” at his resignation after the discussions in Chequers.May also referred to her recent pledge to spend more on the NHS - which she claimed would be partly funded by the “Brexit idend”. Johnson was the cabinet minister most closely associated with Vote Leave’s controversial claim that Brexit would deliver an extra £350m a week for the NHS.Davis was replaced as Brexit secretary by fellow leaver Dominic Raab. Baker was replaced by Chris Heaton-Harris, another Brexiter, who sparked controversy last year after asking universities to supply details of their teaching on the EU.Brussels has not yet made clear how the EU27 will respond to the Chequers deal, which the government believes represents an “evolution” of its negotiating strategy.A senior Brussels source insisted they were unruffled by Davis’s resignation, dismissing it as “UK politics”. “Let’s see how it goes. We negotiate with the negotiators,” he said.Davis’s dissatisfaction had increased in recent months because of the prominent role played by May’s chief negotiator, the senior civil servant Ollie Robbins, in the talks.The European council’s chair, Donald Tusk, tweeted: “Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain. I can only regret that the idea of #Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson. But … who knows?”The government’s offer to follow the EU’s “common rule book” of standards for food and goods, which was last updated in 1997, is intended to allow the UK to erge on the regulation of standards in digital and for other services. Ministers insist that the UK will not accept free movement after Brexit and that there would be no preferential treatment for EU citizens coming to the UK.Friends of Davis insisted there had been no coordination between him and Johnson, but the former Brexit secretary had inadvertently made a “forcing play” - a move in chess that gives the other little choice but to make an unpalatable move themselves.“Boris having flunked one resignation already, if he’d flunked another one he would have been seen as cowardly,” the friend said. After the Chequers summit, it emerged that Johnson had referred to attempts to sell May’s Brexit plan as being akin to “polishing a turd”.One senior Brexiter suggested more resignations could follow in the coming weeks and months. “They’ll keep going, one by one, until she either junks Chequers or goes.”Another leaver, Bolton MP Chris Green, resigned from a junior government post as PPS to Department of Transport after the 1922 meeting, saying he had been unconvinced. Conor Burns MP, Johnson’s former parliamentary private secretary, also stepped down. However, others said there was a show of support for May at the 1922 meeting, with some MPs present banging walls and tables.Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, said the question of a leadership challenge was “out of the window” and said the reception at the 1922 Committee had exceeded expectations. “If you’d told me two hours ago that this is how we’d end the day, I’d have bitten your hand off.”As Johnson’s resignation was announced, Labour MPs were being briefed about the government’s soft Brexit plan by May’s de facto deputy, David Lidington, in a sign that Downing Street is beginning to accept that it will need to draw on cross-party support to get her plans through parliament, without the backing of hardline Brexiters.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, writing in the , urged the prime minister to let parliament agree the next steps. “Theresa May has successfully kicked the can down the road on a number of occasions, but now she has run out of road. It is now time for the majority in parliament to be heard. It’s a majority that rejects the extreme approach to Brexit advocated by some in the Tory party,” he said.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said it was of “grave concern,” that the government had briefed Labour. “If they plan to get this deal through on the back of Labour votes, that would be the most isive thing that they can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cbd49257bba28a472e744c1e7ede5b627706cec/0_67_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ab11cba0769d401727d91b7e7b1344","title":"david davis resigns as brexit secretary live updates","story":"Follow live updates of May’s reshuffle after Boris Johnson followed David Davis in stepping down over BrexitWe’re going to close down this live blog after a frenetic day of politics news.

Hunt added that nations are looking at the UK “wondering what sort of country we’re going to be in the post-Brext world”, adding that we will be a “dependable ally”.Jeremy Hunt has overseen the worst collapse in patient standards of any health secretary in the history of the NHS.His time in charge will be remembered for soaring waiting lists, huge staffing shortages, and patients left with treatments rationed and operations cancelled in record numbers.It is an astonishing measure of the meltdown at the heart of the Tory government that this catalogue of failure is rewarded with promotion rather than the sack. Theresa May should call an end to this shambolic farce. Britain needs a functioning government, not this revolving door of failure.The Press Association is reporting that Boris Johnson has left the foreign secretary’s official residence in central London, following his resignation.Here’s one that’s unlikely to please Tory hard Brexiters: a few days after the referendum, Jeremy Hunt wrote an article for the Daily  calling for the UK to remain in the single market and on the government to work out a deal before triggering article 50, then putting it to a second referendum.The first part of the plan must be clarity that we will remain in the single market. We are the world’s greatest trading nation. We have shaped the world and the world has shaped us through our history of being open to free trade and championing it more than any other. It is not just at the heart of our economic success – it is also at the heart of our identity as one of the most open, liberal, outward-looking societies anywhere.So the British government needs to calm markets and many worried investors and businesses, both locally and internationally, by making it clear that it is an explicit national objective to remain in the single market even as we leave the institutions of the EU.Before setting the clock ticking, we need to negotiate a deal and put it to the British people, either in a referendum or through the Conservative manifesto at a fresh general election.A lot of water has passed under the bridge since those words were written, but Tory backbenchers are already grumbling about the four great offices of state being held by remainers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a954b6d24839b187d7a8191ac5593857d5e1803/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b654209e2b9396590c44f98806abb2","title":"scientists discover worlds oldest colour bright pink sahara","story":"Pigments found in 1.1bn-year-old rocks beneath the Sahara desert shed light on ‘major puzzle’ about early life Scientists have discovered what they say are the world’s oldest colours – and they are bright pink.The pigments were discovered after researchers crushed 1.1bn-year-old rocks found in a marine shale deposit, beneath the Sahara desert, in the Taoudeni basin in Mauritania, west Africa.“Of course you might say that everything has some colour,” said the senior lead researcher, Associate Prof Jochen Brocks from the Australian National University. “What we’ve found is the oldest biological colour.” Brocks compared it to finding a 100m-year-old T rex bone. “It would also have a colour, it would be grey, or brown, but it would tell you nothing about what kind of skin colour a T rex had,” he said. “If you would now find preserved, fossilised skin of a T rex, so that skin still has the original colour of a T rex, say it’s blue or green, that would be amazing. That’s in principle what we’ve discovered … only 10 times older than the typical T rex.“And the molecules we’ve found were not from a large creature but microscopic organisms because animals didn’t exist at that time. That’s the amazing thing.” The colours were discovered by a Phd student, Nur Gueneli, who had crushed the rocks to a powder. She then extracted and analysed molecules of ancient organisms from the substance.Gueneli said the pigments were more than half a billion years older than previous discoveries. “The bright pink pigments are the molecular fossils of chlorophyll that were produced by ancient photosynthetic organisms inhabiting an ancient ocean that has long since vanished,” she said in a statement. The research, supported by Geoscience Australia, was led by ANU and conducted with scientists from the US and Japan.The rocks were sent to ANU from an oil company that was looking for oil underneath the rocks and sand of the Sahara desert about 10 years ago, Brocks said. “They drilled a hole several hundreds metres deep and they hit a deep, black, oily shale,” he said. “It turned out to be 1.1bn years old, which is absolutely incredible.”Brocks said when Gueneli, who is his student, had discovered the colours, he initially was in a state of disbelief. “I remember I heard this screaming in the lab,” he said. “She came running into my office and said, ‘look at this,’ and she had this bright pink stuff.“It turned out to be real pigment, 1.1bn years old.” Brocks added that the discovery was “not just the coolness of having old, pink stuff”, but also helped to solve a “very major puzzle about life” – why large, complex creatures appeared so late in the Earth’s history. While the Earth is about 4.6bn years old, Brocks said, animal-like creatures and other larger things like seaweed only emerged about 600m years ago.When the researchers had analysed the structure of the pink molecule, they were able to find what had produced them – tiny cyanobacteria. “They had been at the bottom of the food chain,” he said. “In the modern ocean we have algae at the bottom of the food chain. Microscopic algae are still very small but they are still 1,000 times bigger than cyanobacteria.“And you need these larger particles as a food source for larger creatures to evolve. Looking at our molecules it became clear … there was no food source for larger creatures. It solves a very old question.”Asked how he felt when he realised they had discovered the world’s oldest colours, Brocks said: “My first thought was just ‘wow’. I was just awestruck that these molecules can survive for such a long time.“What I didn’t know was that these molecules could also solve a big scientific question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ea760af193db4b1a93c729c4cc6b2fd7a4c060/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a81968152f8430fedc223e2234bbfd20","title":"grenfell type cladding on london flats to be replaced at insurers cost","story":"Decision over New Capital Quay could have repercussions for other apartment blocksResidents in London apartment blocks who faced bills of up to £40,000 each for Grenfell-type cladding to be removed have spoken of their relief after their insurer stepped in to foot the bill.In a landmark decision, the National House Building Council, which had provided a 10-year warranty for homeowners in the 11-block New Capital Quay complex in Greenwich, announced on Monday it would be paying for the remedial works.“This has been a highly complex process and residents have understandably been concerned. We have made every effort to ensure they have been kept informed throughout the process and residents can now be assured that they will not have to bear the costs of the work,” it said in a statement.Residents, who were facing a share of a bill estimated at between £25m and £40m for cladding and millions more for round-the-clock fire wardens, were elated with the news. The NHBC said it would accept the insurance claim after it had “concluded that there was a failure to comply with building regulations at the time of construction” following “expert input and a review of the inidual circumstances at this site”.The leaseholders have 10-year warranties with the NHBC to cover building defects. The NHBC also signed off the development in its role as a building control organisation. The NHBC said the developer was “legally responsible for ensuring compliance with building regulations. NHBC, as the building control body, does not confirm, guarantee or approve that buildings comply with building regulations.”Residents had told of their fear of living in a building they believed could be a fire trap since discovering the Grenfell-style cladding last year.They have also said they felt locked in a financial trap because their homes had become unsellable, with one woman, Cecile Langevin, told her £475,000 flat was worth just £50,000.A second family, which has seen the value of its London flat slashed from £600,000 to just £90,000 because of the Grenfell-style cladding, was thrilled to learn they no longer faced the bill. “I think it is amazing. It’s the most pertinent thing that we all wanted. We just wanted to live somewhere that was safe. I was genuinely getting worried about living there,” said Nerisa Ahmed, who bought the flat with her husband under the help-to-buy scheme and had two offers fall through in the past six months because of the cladding.Leaseholders received a letter from the NHBC to say it would settle claims made by Galliard, which built the flats, on behalf of leaseholders “by making a payment equal to the cost of the remedial scheme, in accordance with the terms of the applicable policies. This will include the replacement of the ACM cladding”. It did not mention the cost of fire wardens who have been in the building around the clock, adding millions to the cost. The Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, Matthew Pennycook, who has been campaigning for a year to get help for panicked residents, described the development as “fantastic news”.New Capital Quay is believed to be the biggest single development with Grenfell-type cladding with 2,000 residents over the Thames-side development.The decision by NHBC will be followed closely by the construction industry, with developers and freeholders locked in disputes over who is liable to replace Grenfell-style cladding. “As the warranty insurance provider at New Capital Quay, NHBC has investigated a claim under our policy and we can confirm that we have accepted this claim,” said NHBC. It said the decision on Greenwich would not set a precedent for other similar claims and it would assess future claims on their merits.Galliard declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57fe7b8eace9f8bfcae3936a12d0f78b8d734415/202_59_3176_1905/master/3176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b7dfd5aa9ce9d470bbb5592acf3769","title":"joe root england t20 least of worries","story":"Paul Farbrace says Test captain will still play a big part despite omission from final game against IndiaThe defeat by India in the T20 series is not a calamity but it is a chastening reminder that England, whatever the rankings, do not necessarily rule the roost in white-ball cricket.In Bristol in particular there was also the warning that if the sun keeps shining there are going to be some tough days ahead in the ODIs for bowlers on hard-baked pitches and glassy outfields.Paul Farbrace, who was in charge of England during the T20 phase of the summer, is instinctively an optimistic fellow hence he was quick to note: “We’ve learned a lot over the last four matches and we’ve also been taught a lesson in T20 cricket as well”. He highlighted how, in the final game, India kept playing “strong cricket shots” rather than over-elaborating by attempting clever little dinks to third man.Farbrace also expanded on the dropping of Joe Root, a justifiable decision but an interesting one. Root is England’s best batsman he is the Test captain and Farbrace more or less said that he is not an “anachronism” in T20. Ten days earlier, he had suggested he was undroppable.“You need people who can manipulate the strike, can play spin well and keep you in tight games. That’s a skill Joe has he has the ability to hit boundaries he might not have the raw power of a Stokes or a Bairstow but strong cricket shots, even in T20, will get your reward.“I still believe that if England are to be successful in T20 cricket over the next couple of years leading into the World Cup, Joe will play a magnificent and big part in that.”Even so, Root was dropped – though there was confirmation from Eoin Morgan he will return for the ODI at Nottingham on Thursday. It is rare for a player of his stature to be left out rather than “rested”.Root reacted appropriately. He was both disappointed and eagerly ferrying drinks out to the middle. He had no alternative. Root has been – and will be – involved in hairline selectorial decisions for his Test team. He knows all about the emotions involved for the captain and now he has a reminder what it feels like for the omitted player. His character will allow him to use this as a learning experience it will also spur him on to greater heights against a white ball, I suspect.“Any experience like he’s had over the last few days will definitely help him. And I’ll stick to what I’ve said many times before: players learn from players and I’m sure that Joe will be watching the way Morgs talks to the team, the way he goes about things, the way that he makes decisions and I’m sure those two will have lots of conversations about the role of being England captain whether it’s with a red ball or a white ball”.Root, therefore, is the least of England’s worries in white-ball cricket. He will react to being dropped like all great cricketers do: he will be gutted and come back stronger. Of greater concern is how the bowlers, who could well be pummelled in the sun for what may seem an interminable 50 of overs, will survive over the next 10 days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ecfd777e5f78c22aa6844dce0d1049ad4bebd70/634_475_4019_2411/master/4019.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d2a3b826b94e8fbe5f910f2660766ef","title":"wayne pivac to succeed gatland as new wales rugby union coach after the world cup","story":"Wayne Pivac has been appointed Wales’s head coach but will not take up the position for 15 months. The 55-year-old New Zealander, who has spent the last four years with the Scarlets, will succeed Warren Gatland after next year’s World Cup, with the Welsh Rugby Union moving early to avoid a frenzy of speculation leading up to the tournament in Japan.Four of the last six full-time Wales coaches have been New Zealanders, starting with Graham Henry in 1998, the year he also invited Pivac to become one of his assistants at Auckland. He was succeeded by Steve Hansen, the current New Zealand head coach, and Gatland took over after the 2007 World Cup.“We have secured the best man for the job and we have done so rigorously and decisively to the collective benefit of all involved in Welsh rugby,” WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips said. “Both Wayne and Warren and their coaching teams, our international players, supporters and everyone at the Scarlets now have clarity and there is no underestimating the positive benefit to be gained from having the time to plan properly for the future. “We have avoided the feeding frenzy that can come at the end of a World Cup year and we have been meticulous in ensuring we have someone of the talent, experience, charisma and rugby acumen to do the very best possible job for Welsh rugby. The handover process is something we will plan carefully and commence in detail next summer.” Hansen and Gatland are the only two Wales coaches in the professional era who have left at a time of their choosing. When the WRU learned two years ago that Gatland would not seek a renewal of his contract in 2019, it started an immediate search for his successor that, with time not an issue, saw them interview 10 candidates and speak to a variety of people in the game all over the world to get their views on what made an outstanding coach.“It is fair to say that when we started this process, during the Wales tour to New Zealand in 2016, Wayne was not a leading contender,” said Gareth Davies, the WRU chairman. “But I remember having a game of golf in Wellington with someone I will not name who said that he knew a number of players who had worked with Graham Henry, Steve Hansen and Wayne and they rated Wayne the best of them.“The Scarlets won the league in style the following year and that was important because success was one of the criteria we had laid down in the search process. If you have not been successful domestically, it is unlikely you will be at international level.”Pivac arrived at the Scarlets four years ago as forwards coach, quickly taking over after head coach Simon Easterby left for Ireland. The region had been struggling but after overseeing a clear-out and bringing in the region’s former international and Lions’ outside-half Stephen Jones to reshape attacking strategy, last year’s then Pro 12 success was followed by a Champions Cup semi-final and another league final, although they lost to Leinster in Dublin on both occasions.“Having lived in the country for four years, I do not see myself as an outsider but a Welsh coach,” said Pivac, who was on holiday in New Zealand when the WRU chief executive, Martyn Phillips, rang last week to offer him the job. “I would not have put myself through the process if I did not feel it was something I could do and was really passionate about.“It is an advantage to know regional rugby as I do and I felt comfortable putting my name forward. Warren has had success and that is what I will strive to achieve. People at the Scarlets probably felt we were a wee bit off a couple of years ago but with hard work you can achieve great things. With the talent there is in Wales, as was seen on the recent successful tour to Argentina, we have the opportunity to do well.”Pivac will remain with the Scarlets next season, giving the region time to find his successor, when he will have nothing to do with Wales. The WRU envisages putting him on the payroll in July next year when he will decide his coaching team and start planning for the 2023 World Cup. He is likely to call on Jones, who will also be a candidate to take over at the Scarlets.It will not be Pivac’s first international job: he was Fiji’s head coach from 2004 to 2007. “From the day I left Fiji I wanted to experience Test rugby again,” he said. “I am a more mature coach now and the Wales position is one I am going to enjoy.”Pivac, who coached Fiji at international level from 2004 to 2007, has been in charge at the Scarlets for the past four seasons, having initially been assistant to Simon Easterby. Under Pivac the Scarlets won the Pro12 title in 2017 and were pipped by Leinster when defending their title in the recently completed season. They also lost to Leinster in the semi-finals of this year’s European Champions Cup.Pivac will continue as Scarlets boss until the end of the 201819 season and will not officially come under WRU employment until July 2019, with Gatland leading Wales into the World Cup. Gatland’s 12-year reign will make him the nation’s longest-serving and most successful head coach. “I know I’m following in the footsteps of someone who is held in extremely high regard, not only by the Welsh public but also by the players who have played under him,” Pivac said. “I will be doing my best to protect the legacy which Warren Gatland, with the help of those players, will inevitably leave behind. It will be an almighty challenge, but one that I’m more than ready for and one that I will relish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b8369b28f9e94794d4e17f8ed66f000ddf2ad8e/0_180_4436_2662/master/4436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba6210c27a3567c16aa69e48317d0dfb","title":"kimi raikkonen british grand prix lewis hamilton","story":"What had been a thrilling race to the end was still disappointing for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes and they closed it with what felt like sour grapes. The suggestion that Ferrari were deliberately targeting their cars and that Kimi Räikkönen had intentionally hit Hamilton was farcical on many levels, not least that planning to do so would have had to anticipate Hamilton losing places.Equally with damage likely to go both ways and Ferrari very much in the constructors’ fight it would have been self-defeating. Hamilton and Mercedes have since accepted it was a racing incident. Their reaction was perhaps a reflection of the heat of the moment and the shock of being beaten in their backyard where they have been so dominant for so long. Räikkönen’s wife, Minttu, had her own take on the spat. “If you cry like a girl when you lose, do ballet,” she wrote on Instagram.Vettel’s reaction was of huge satisfaction at having beaten Mercedes at Silverstone. “Grande vittoria,” he said. “Qui a casa loro”. Understandably the German was ecstatic at having done it “here at their home”. Beating Mercedes at the meeting where they have won every time since the turbo-hybrid era began was significant. Mercedes brought their new engine to Paul Ricard and their first major aero upgrade to Austria.They would have expected to have put their noses in front but Ferrari with a new floor at Silverstone look to have matched or bettered them. Certainly the Scuderia’s car performs better in the high temperatures, with the Mercedes at its best in the relative cool of Friday morning. Just what the differential between Vettel and Hamilton might have been had they been fighting on the same tyres for the same part of track looks too close to call but with hot races expected at the next rounds in Hockenheim and Budapest, it is Ferrari who have every reason to believe they are the front runners.McLaren opened the week of their home grand prix by announcing the resignation of their sporting director Eric Boullier, not unexpected news given the torrid time the team have been enduring. They accompanied it with a restructuring of management roles as they try to reverse the decline with the team now at the lowest point in their 52-year history.The CEO, Zak Brown, highlighted a dearth of consistent leadership at the team since 2012 as central to the problem but that was compounded by a lack of singular technical vision driving the building of the car, instead using a group of three departments. The former McLaren designer John Barnard highlighted it as the fundamental problem and Brown acknowledged the result was “not a good race car”. What is clear is the need to address this issue and it can be expected that the next big announcement from McLaren will be the appointment of a single technical director. Their problem with the current market is just whom they can find to fill the crucial role.The deputy team principal, Claire Williams, said she was dreading the team’s home grand prix, so poor has their car proved this year. She said the situation was heartbreaking and it cannot have given any pleasure to Sir Frank, back in the Williams garage at Silverstone. It was never going to be an easy weekend for them but what transpired was a slow-motion car crash.Both Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin went off in the first qualifying session and they were the slowest cars in the field. The new wing the team had brought to improve aero performance proved a step backward, causing a loss of grip when the DRS closed. They had to replace the wings and start from the pit lane. They finished once again at the back of the field.Williams have a single technical director in Paddy Lowe but what became clear at Silverstone is the sheer scale of his task. It will be an awfully long season for the team.Hamilton’s recovery drive was a magnificent show but his comeback from 18th also illustrated the huge differential between the big three and the rest of the field.Hamilton scythed though the midfield, up to sixth within 10 laps, all in overtaking manoeuvres.Admittedly no one put up a real fight – they were to all intents in a different race – but the way he could breeze past proved just what a huge task Ross Brawn faces in trying to level this playing field in the new regulations of 2021. There was also a further demonstration of another gulf as Renault’s engine deficit to Ferrari and Mercedes was again exposed. Max Verstappen, who did his best in a valiant fight with Räikkönen, said it was as if he was driving in a different series from the leaders.Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, admitted the team “were just hugely exposed, in both defence and attack”.Optimism that they can still challenge for the title took a real blow at Silverstone in the scale of their deficit. Some long afternoons lie ahead at Spa and Monza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e14d68e27af6246ab815b44edea7bcbf76db0757/46_59_5137_3083/master/5137.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c3097021de5608b74c6bfde6b3a9f2","title":"uk slips to 35th in global table of broadband speeds","story":"Result puts Britain in bottom third of EU countries and below MadagascarThe UK has slipped to 35th place in an annual league table of global broadband speeds, putting it in the bottom third of EU countries and below the likes of Madagascar and Bulgaria.An analysis of more than 160m broadband speed tests conducted across 200 countries revealed Singapore was once again the world’s fastest country, followed by Sweden, Denmark and Norway, while Yemen came last.According to the analysis, carried out during the 12 months to 29 May, the UK achieved an average speed of 18.57Mbps, which means downloading a 5GB HD movie would typically take just over 36 minutes.

That is the question. I do understand if you’re not. But, if you are, or even if you are vacillating, Sharp Objects should be your very first choice.Adapted from Gillian “Gone Girl” Flynn’s twisty, twisted debut novel by Marti Noxon (most recently showrunner and executive producer of Dietland, although probably for ever most famous for her oversight of and writing for Buffy the Vampire Slayer), directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, who gave Big Little Lies all its beauty and much of its torque, and starring multiple-Oscar nominee Amy Adams, it is a pedigree production that manages to be even more than the sum of its parts.Adams plays Camille Preaker, a reporter sent by her editor to cover the story of two girls – Ann Nash, murdered, and Natalie Keene, missing – in her home town of Wind Gap, Missouri. He seems to intend it as a gesture of compassion, an assignment that will give her the chance to exorcise some childhood demons that he intuits plague her.Yes. Well. That really depends on the demons, and Camille’s are rapidly shown to be the kind just barely kept away by a massive alcohol dependency and – if the occasional glimpses of scars on her flesh are anything to go by – a history of self-harm.Missouri is technically a midwestern state, but it is the last one before the south proper begins, and the sense that the madness of Dixieland refuses to be wholly contained by geopolitical border constructs grows. Bibulous eccentrics are found at roadsides. Chatty receptionists deal in non-sequiturs: purple ribbons festoon a memorial to Nash, one explains, despite the fact that black was her favourite colour. “Black just seemed too grim.”Flashbacks to wanderings in the woods and teenage dens plastered in porn with boys cackling outside, suffocating dreams and the kind of shards of repressed memories that can pierce the thickest hangover abound, but do not yet coalesce into explanation. A further source of disequilibrium for Camille and for us all is Adora, her mother (Patricia Clarkson), a woman who clearly took one look at the fibrillating neuroses of Tennessee Williams’ various creations and thought: “Hold my cocktail.”These more-or-less faintly hallucinatory scenes intertwine with Camille’s day-to-day efforts to build up a picture of the dead and missing. The natives are polite but, even to a fellow Gapper, unforthcoming. Like the receptionist and Adora, they want things to stay as nice as possible for as long as they can.This becomes markedly harder when the body of Keene is discovered, but, as Adora insists, surely not impossible. She has had a lot of practice at keeping things nice, it turns out. One of Camille’s sisters died young, we learn (though not how), and her room is kept unchanged and immaculate. Her other sister, teenaged Amma (Eliza Scanlen), rollerskates in hotpants around town, but plays the dutiful daughter in pinafore dresses once back home. And whatever horrors lurk in Camille’s past and poison her dreams do not seem to have been submitted for open and supportive discussion at the kitchen table. “I’m having a very hard time, as you can imagine,” Camille’s mother says of the murders. When she hears her daughter is reporting on them, she decides: “I’ll just pretend you’re on a summer break.”The story is really about the effects of repression and denial on an inidual level and beyond – the monstrousness that can fester when we do not let in light or truth. The murder mystery is, so far, subordinate to that of Camille’s psyche, but the one is set fair to help disentangle the other as we move through the next seven parts of the series.Adams is even better than we’ve seen her before, giving us an absolutely mesmerising portrait of a woman ground down from within by what she has suffered and with no energy left even to hope for salvation.It is altogether mean, moody and magnificent and a fine addition to the gathering tide of female-led and female-driven dramas. Sharp Objects is part of a new breed of slickly produced but weighty vehicles for brilliant actors of beyond-starlet age that explore multiple plot strands, women’s stories and contemporary issues and prove, via overwhelming critical and popular acclaim, that talent survives beyond a lady’s 30th birthday. Seeing that on screen need not lead to mass retchings of fear and disgust.This shouldn’t be noteworthy in 2018, of course, but it is, so let us note it. Progress is progress, whenever it comes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d396c17328c60a8667263c81b2782cc57c728921/38_0_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f4d01fe58e43c45ce2af584b242661","title":"montana baby found woods debris","story":"Five-month-old boy found safe and well after being abandoned in western Montana forest wearing wet clothes in cold weatherA five-month-old baby has miraculously survived more than nine hours being buried under a pile of sticks and debris in the woods of western Montana, suffering only minor injuries despite wearing wet and soiled clothes in cold weather, authorities said Monday.The baby boy is otherwise in good condition, authorities said.Missoula county sheriff’s deputies were called about 8pm Saturday about a man threatening people in the Lolo Hot Springs area of the Lolo national forest.Deputies apprehended the man, who indicated that a baby was buried somewhere in the woods.The sheriff’s office hastily put together a search crew of federal, state and local officials that combed the forest outside the hot springs for six hours before a deputy heard a baby’s cry at about 2.30am Sunday.He found the baby facedown under the pile of sticks and debris, dressed only in a wet and soiled onesie in the 46F (8C) weather.“He suffered some minor scrapes and bruising but overall is in good health,” sheriff’s spokeswoman Brenda Bassett said in a statement Monday.The baby was taken to a hospital.

Phoebe Bridgers, an indisputably hip musician, nearly pulled it off when she scooted around Los Angeles in last summer’s video for her song Motion Sickness, but even then the effect was charmingly dorky. No one, not even someone who is actually cool, can scoot without looking like an oversized child.Still, it is 2018 and we all need to face our prejudices. So I headed into Paris to try out the first “free-floating” electric scooters available for hire in Europe, left out on the streets and controlled with a mobile\u0026nbspapp.I have lived in the French capital for three years, mostly navigating it by bike. Now, it is the testing ground for US startups’ grand plans of conquering Europe with a craze that has swept dozens of US cities from Washington DC to San Francisco. To their fans, e-scooters are quick, cheap and moderately green, plus you get to pretend you are a big kid. For some city officials, however, they are a menace a regulatory headache and a source of potential accidents, with abandoned scooters, and sometimes their drivers, strewn across pavements.The Paris scheme launched on 21 June and is operated by Lime, one of a handful of Californian scooter startups that have been hurtling along a dizzying trajectory, raising hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital in a matter of\u0026nbspmonths.The Lime scooters are solid but fairly lightweight, easy to spot thanks to their bright green motors and nippy, with a maximum speed of 15 miles (24km) an hour. You locate the nearest one with the app and turn it on by scanning the QR code on the handlebars. At this point you are charged €1 (£0.88) – $1 in the US – then it is 15 cents for every minute of ride time.On this morning there are more than 200 scooters scattered around central Paris. Stateside, Lime operates a scheme whereby members of the public can get paid to take them home and charge them. But for now at least, a 40-strong staff in Paris has been picking them up each night, charging them and putting them back on the streets, ready for the morning. The scooters are clustered around the city centre, making them an impractical option for commuters living beyond the tourist zone, including myself, although Lime France says it will be adding more imminently.I decide to test one near Notre-Dame cathedral and track down four with the app on the Pont Neuf bridge. My chosen steed unlocks smoothly, and I’m off. I initially hoped to take to scooting like a sort of Parisian Marty McFly, zooming into the rush hour with a tug on the throttle and an insouciant shrug. In reality, my debut is ungainly and I jerk along for a couple of metres before coming to an uncertain stop. Still, it is pretty easy to get the hang of: brake with your left hand, push the throttle with your left, allez!The early adopters of the scooters are mostly young and techy. Kévin Ghanbarzadeh, the French celebrity gamer better known as Shaunz, was among the first European converts after testing Lime’s arch-rival Bird – the fastest startup ever to reach the coveted “unicorn” status of a $1bn (£750m) valuation, and now set to hit double that – on a recent trip to Miami. “I was so surprised to see this scheme arrive in France that I couldn’t wait to try it,” says the 26-year-old. “It doesn’t cost much and you can go pretty fast. I wouldn’t use it that often, but occasionally, yes – to go out with a friend, or to come back after a night out instead of the Métro or an Uber.”Parisians are quick to slap down my opinion that e-scooters are for losers. “They used to be a bit uncool, but they have been cropping up in Paris for a few years,” says Camille Pailleret, a management consultant trying one out for the first time. “Now, they have really been democratised and are kind of neat.“The metro and buses are so crowded that I thought it would be interesting to try something that would let me breathe a bit,” she adds, giving it a big thumbs up as she zooms off.Lime, Bird and other startups – Uber and its rival Lyft are tipped to enter the scooter market – are banking on large numbers of Europeans falling for scooters as Americans have. Local companies are also entering the fray, with Brussels firm Troty launching a dockless service in the Belgian capital on 29 June.The prospects of taking one for a spin in the UK are slim, though. E-scooters, like hoverboards and Segways, are banned from UK roads and pavements, and the Department for Transport says there are no plans to change the rules. But there will be plenty of places to try them out on the continent. Lime, which has nearly a million users of its scooters and e-bikes in 60 US cities, wants to be in more than 25 European cities by the end of the year.“We are pretty aggressive in terms of expansion,” says Arthur-Louis Jacquier, director of Lime France. As for Paris, he insists the company is here to stay, despite the scepticism, given the mixed fortunes of Parisian transport ventures of late. Jacquier was previously European vice-president for Gobee.bike, one of several dockless cycle providers that have popped up in Paris since late last year. The Hong Kong-based company quit the French capital, along with several other European cities, within a few months after thousands of its bikes were stolen or\u0026nbspvandalised.Jacquier says the bicycles had faced two main problems – mindless violence and bad parking, which irritated residents – but that Lime has fixes for both. “Because we retrieve our scooters every night to charge them and repair them if needed, we are able to protect our fleet from vandalism. And in the morning we can deploy them in places where it is not annoying for\u0026nbspanybody.” But like the free-floating hire bikes, the scooters are already irritating some Parisians by adding to growing clutter on pavements. “I nearly threw one into the Seine last night,” says Vincent Jarousseau, a documentary photographer. He was furious after crashing into a scooter that had toppled on to a riverside cycle path and suffering a bad fall from his bike.Paris follows a long list of US cities that have wrestled with how to regulate scooters to minimise accidents. San Francisco has temporarily pulled them from its streets and is set to bring in a tentative cap of 1,250 across a maximum of five companies. For now, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has settled for a code of conduct, signed by Lime along with dockless bike operators. This, notably, gives them just 24 hours to pick up wrecked vehicles that lie abandoned against rubbish bins and\u0026nbsptrees.“These operators will not stay long in Paris – and won’t have a profitable business – unless they are accepted by Parisians and have a minimum amount of discipline,” says Hidalgo’s deputy for urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika.Disciplined or not, some experts are sceptical of the scooters’ chances of survival in the City of Light. “Something that works in San Francisco won’t necessarily work in Paris,” says Nicolas Louvet, director of transport consultancy 6t. “The public transport is completely different – plus it’s a lot easier to walk around Paris.” (The city is extremely compact for a capital.)One aspect in Lime’s favour is that it has arrived in Paris at a particularly chaotic time for its transport network. The once popular Vélib docking bikes are in meltdown following a disastrous rollout of an “upgrade”, which has left their 300,000 users looking for other options. The Autolib electric car-share scheme is shutting down at the end of July, mired in debt. “There is a lot of stuff in the mix and some of it will disappear,” says Louvet.He describes Parisians as “spoiled children” when it comes to transport, presented with an ever-changing array of options to try and then give up when something new appears – which will, he says, because services such as Lime are operating under a hugely competitive, fast-moving model where “they have to keep reinventing themselves”.As for me, I can’t say I will be switching from cycling for my daily commute. Taking to the roads on the e-scooter was unnerving in Paris. I didn’t feel stable enough to look over my shoulder to check if anyone was behind me, or let go with one hand to indicate. But I could imagine using one to explore some other European city – ideally one with fewer motorcyclists. After a bit of practice, I might even look cool doing it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b434d5e887d03c990646e830a67e491a96d6adc/393_28_1405_843/master/1405.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13462a1cef04e21c4ffafd2c41a5b2aa","title":"erdogan sworn in as turkish president with enhanced powers","story":"Leader takes oath of office after winning snap election last monthRecep Tayyip Erdoğan has been sworn in for another term as president of Turkey, inaugurating a new political system that grants the leader vast powers.“We make a promise once more to strengthen our nation’s unity and brotherhood and to continue making our country great and glorifying our state,” Erdoğan said after visiting the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the Turkish republic’s founder, in the capital, Ankara.Erdoğan took the oath of office in a ceremony in the Grand National Assembly, the culmination of nearly a decade of political activism to transform the country’s parliamentary democracy into a presidential system.

Their electoral victory paves the way for unrivalled control of the levers of the state by Erdoğan, whose critics have accused him of authoritarianism as he has moved with his party over the past few years to crush dissidents and intimidate critical media outlets.Next Sunday is the second anniversary of a failed coup attempt in which 250 people were killed and 1,400 wounded. The coup was followed by a crackdown on members of the bureaucracy, judiciary, armed forces, police, media and academia, with more than 130,000 people dismissed from their jobs or arrested.The crackdown has gone beyond the alleged perpetrators of the coup – followers of the US-based exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen – to encompass dissidents of all stripes. Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, and prosecutions of media personnel and civil society members have continued in recent months.Observers speculated that the purge might ease after the elections, but on Sunday the government issued a decree dismissing 18,000 state employees including teachers, police and military officers over alleged links to terrorist groups. A state of emergency in place since the coup attempt is scheduled to expire next week.Turkey is expected to adopt an increasingly nationalistic line in its foreign policy with the conservative and Islamic-leaning AKP and the nationalist MHP in parliament. Erdoĝan has repeatedly clashed with strategic allies such as the US and the European Union in recent years over the war in Syria, Turkey’s accession to the EU, human rights abuses by Ankara, Europe’s failure to support Turkey during the coup attempt, and rising Islamophobia in Europe.In a signal of those differences, 22 heads of state attended the inauguration, but none from western powers such as the US, Germany, France or the UK. Empowered by a popular mandate on the back of a convincing electoral victory, Erdoğan will have to address urgent questions in Turkey such as the fate of more than 3 million Syrian refugees living in the country, the progress of the war across the border, a faltering economy and a weakening currency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e72165702005b48f4b8854cc5bec8d9a8fcb3f2/0_154_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7834dece450ddf70940e43c6e4e541f6","title":"imran kahn accused over defence of pakistan blasphemy laws","story":"PTI leader accused of using blasphemy issue to win backing of religious right Imran Khan has been accused of risking bloodshed for electoral gain after the former cricketer-turned-politician offered a full-throated defence of Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws in the run-up to the general election on 25 July.“We are standing with Article 295c and will defend it,” said the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) at a gathering of Muslim leaders in Islamabad on Saturday, referring to the clause of the constitution that mandates the death penalty for any “imputation, insinuation or innuendo” against the prophet Muhammad.Khan, 65, also directed anger at the rival party in the electoral race, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), by resurfacing controversy over its hastily withdrawn edits to an electoral oath last year, which Islamists deem blasphemous.Few politicians dare to speak out against Pakistan’s blasphemy laws: the last to prominently do so, Sen Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated in 2011, and a new political party formed in honour of his killer, Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP), has thrust its way into the election campaign, fielding almost as many candidates as the established parties.Increasing hysteria around the blasphemy laws has led to the targeting of minorities, fake allegations and at least 69 vigilante murders since 1990.Polls suggest a neck-a-neck vote and critics accused Khan of using the blasphemy issue to win support from religious rightwingers, a not uncommon tactic in Pakistani politics.Taseer’s son Shahbaz told the : “My father was a hero and a champion for change. He wanted amendments in this barbaric law.“Imran Khan is a coward he is supporting murderers and mob violence. This law is persecuting people, it is not respecting our prophet.”Khan launched the PTI’s manifesto at a press conference in Islamabad on Monday, promising to turn Pakistan into an Islamic welfare state, create 10m jobs and work for Pakistanis without “religious discrimination”.In recent weeks, the PTI has appeared to capitalise on the controversy surrounding Khatam-e-Nabuwwat, the election oath taken by incoming politicians that includes swearing on the finality of the prophet Muhammad.Islamists claim the PML-N watered down the oath last year to relax strictures on the Ahmadiyya, a widely persecuted Islamic sect that believes another prophet may have followed Muhammad. Several PTI candidates have flagged up the controversy in campaign speeches, while religiously minded politicians in Punjab have flocked to join the party.“Ahmadis will be targeted and murdered as a result,” said Shahbaz Taseer. On Saturday, gunmen stormed the home of the leader of the Ahmadi youth community in Faisalabad, killing him and his wife. A 2017 report by the community recorded rising persecution, including four “hate crime” murders and 77 arrests under discriminatory religious laws.On Saturday, the human rights activist and election candidate Jibran Nasir refused a member of the public’s request to label Ahmadis non-Muslim. “My politics doesn’t revolve around religion even if it costs me votes,” he tweeted, adding that allegations of a conspiracy against the blasphemy laws “are not the change we are expecting from the PTI”.“It is extremely sad that we are not progressing from the Zia era”, he added, referring to the 1970s rule of Gen Zia-ul-Haq, who tightened blasphemy laws.Analysts queried whether Khan, who is widely tipped to be the next prime minister amid widespread allegations that the military establishment is lined up against the PML-N, needed to raise the issue at all. On Friday, the chief of the PML-N, Nawaz Sharif, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for corruption.Fasi Zaka, a pundit, said: “I’m surprised he’s done it after the announcement of the verdict. Now that his opponent is severely crippled, it’s needless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a634b353f043fb3f888815f0131bbf9a52b7b3/562_104_4119_2472/master/4119.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0d2175ec5c4d3cdeb7d1474d9c0e32b","title":"macron pledges to overhaul french welfare state","story":"President promises changes to unemployment benefits, pensions and health systemEmmanuel Macron has promised to overhaul the French welfare state and cut public spending, telling MPs at the Palace of Versailles that his only ideology is to strive for “French greatness”. The pro-business, centrist leader, who beat the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in an election a year ago, denied seeking to help the wealthy at the expense of the poor as he sought to shake off accusations that he is a “president of the rich”. Macron’s approval ratings have dipped particularly among the left and working-class voters, and a majority of French voters question whether they will benefit from his flagship policies including loosening labour laws, cutting corporate taxes and changing the workings of the state rail operator SNCF in the face of union strikes. On Monday in the president’s yearly address to both houses of parliament, Macron tried to strike a more humble note. “This is an office that, realistically, requires humility,” he said, seated in an ornate meeting hall in the gilded palace of France’s former monarchy. “But humility in oneself, not humility for France.”He said of the coming year: “The priority is simple: build the welfare state of the 21st century.”His view of a new welfare state essentially amounts to a move away from a model of redistribution towards a Nordic-style system of “flexi-security” in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid labour code to a society of iniduals moving between jobs.Macron promised changes to unemployment benefits, pensions and the health system. He said one in five children in France were living in poverty, and said his overhauled welfare state would mean “getting people out of poverty”, not distributing benefits that kept them in poverty.He defended his support for business, saying that without strong business there would be no economic “cake” to share out. “It’s false to think we can protect workers without defending our companies,” he said.But he said he was conscious there was still a fracture between those at the bottom of society and those at the top. The pro-European president promised “a new patriotism” for France, saying: “The true border splitting Europe is the one which separates progressives from nationalists. We will have to face this for at least a decade.”The French government will unveil a plan in coming weeks to cut public spending and keep the budget within EU deficit targets. Macron has promised to slash state spending – among the highest among wealthy countries relative to its economy – in order to balance the French budget for the first time in more than 40 years.A number of lawmakers on the left in the France Unbowed party boycotted the Versailles speech, calling it a “monarchic drift”. Meanwhile, Le Pen, whose far-right Front National was recently renamed National Rally, began an emergency fundraising drive after her party’s public subsidies were seized by judges investigating illicit funding allegations. Le Pen vowed to challenge judges’ veto of a €2m (£1.75m) state subsidy payment, saying the decision could kill the party in a matter of weeks. Two magistrates are investigating allegations that the party channelled money destined for European parliamentary assistants towards staff who were instead working purely for the party.

Photograph: Axel SchmidtReutersGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has called into line her rebellious interior minister over an unco-ordinated intervention in the European Commission’s Brexit negotiations. Horst Seehofer, who is also leader of Bavaria’s CSU party, which is allied to Dr Merkel’s CDU, sent a letter on June 27th to the European Commission, warning that its rigid Brexit line could weaken EU security architecture. That in turn, he wrote, “would affect all EU citizens and undermine their fundamental need for security”.“The ever-present threat of cross-border terrorism shows the need for unlimited co-operation in future,” he wrote in the letter, first reported on last week by the Financial Times.On Friday a spokesman for Dr Merkel declined to comment on whether the letter was co-ordinated with the chancellor. Behind the scenes, though, the German leader was said to be livid. Since Brexit talks have begun, she has muzzled all her ministers and deferred to the commission in negotiations to head off any attempts to ide the EU27 member states.In Brussels, Germany’s permanent EU representation told the commission Mr Seehofer’s remarks were of a personal nature.“I would like to make it clear that this is not a letter agreed in the federal government,” wrote Thomas Eckert, a senior diplomat, in a leaked letter. He insisted the federal government position had not changed and that the Brussels executive had the lead role in talks with London.News of Mr Seehofer’s solo run on Brexit came days after he agreed an uneasy truce with Dr Merkel on migration. He had threatened to resign as interior minister unless new measures were agreed to cut the numbers of migrants seeking asylum in his home state of Bavaria.With an eye on October’s state election there , the ruling CSU is anxious to burnish its law-and-order credentials with voters in the hope of clawing back its absolute majority.But polls suggest that may be a far-fetched hope given the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – steady on 13 per cent support– stands in the way of its absolute majority.In a major blow for the CSU, which has ruled Bavaria almost continuously in the post-war era, a new poll suggests the migration row hurt rather than helped the party. After bringing the coalition to the brink of collapse in Berlin, the CSU in Bavaria is down now to just 38 per cent support – some 10 points off its last election result. A poll defeat in October would raise huge questions about the CSU front bench and underline Mr Seehofer’s diminishing authority as party leader.Some 54 per cent of Germans say they are dissatisfied with his work since becoming federal interior minister earlier this year. His challenge this week is to deliver on refugee return agreements with unenthusiastic interior minister colleagues in Austria and Italy.  Matteo Salvini, Italy’s populist interior minister, told Der Spiegel magazine: “We cannot take in a single refugee more ... on the contrary, we want to give up some.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559393.1531165411!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rumours swirl over may s fate but pm survives crunch backbench meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRuptures aplenty: David Davis (left) is no longer Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson (centre) is no longer foreign secretary, in Theresa May’s cabinet. File photograph: Peter NichollsAFPGetty ImagesAround 3pm on Monday afternoon, the foreign ministers of 13 European countries were waiting in the neo-classical splendour of Lancaster House for the start of a Western Balkans Summit when they heard that their host Boris Johnson would not be coming.The foreign secretary had resigned, becoming the third minister, after Brexit secretary David Davis and Brexit minister Steve Baker, to leave Theresa May’s government in less than 24 hours.Determined to prevent Johnson from taking control of the media narrative, Downing Street announced his departure while he was still writing his resignation letter and as the prime minister prepared to make a statement in the House of Commons about the Brexit proposal agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last Friday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe awayday at Chequers was a formal cabinet meeting, and ministers’ approval of the Brexit plan was recorded in the usual way. Over the weekend, Brexiteers including Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling went on television and radio to express support for the prime minister’s proposal.Davis and Johnson did not appear, although the former foreign secretary’s friends briefed that he would not resign because he wanted to remain in cabinet to fight against further compromises.Davis spent much of Sunday watching motor racing at Silverstone, but he called May that evening to offer his resignation, telling her she needed a Brexit secretary who believed in her plan. He had been unhappy for months, particularly since the prime minister’s top Brexit civil servant Olly Robbins was given effective control of the negotiations with Brussels late last year.Davis’s resignation was announced shortly before midnight with the traditional exchange of letters – Davis telling the prime minister the Chequers deal meant that Britain was now unlikely to leave the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. As I said at cabinet, the ‘common rule book’ policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn her response, the prime minister said she disagreed with his characterisation of the Chequers deal, which she described as a “precise, responsible and credible” approach to the negotiations.When he appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today early on Monday morning, Davis sounded conciliatory, making clear he was not encouraging other ministers to follow suit and expressing his admiration for the prime minister.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSteve Baker, a former leader of the European Research Group (ERG) of Brexiteer backbenchers, resigned overnight, but Downing Street was reassured by the decision of another Brexit minister, Suella Braverman, to remain in her post. Trouble was brewing, however, with Jacob Rees-Mogg declaring that a number of Brexiteer MPs would join him in voting against any Brexit deal based on the Chequers plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen it emerged that Downing Street had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the Chequers plan, Rees-Mogg expressed outrage that May was considering the possibility of passing a Brexit deal with “the votes of socialists”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Johnson was nowhere to be seen, but his silence was raising suspicions and fuelling rumours about his impending departure. Downing Street made the announcement in a terse statement before May went into the Commons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAlthough hardline Brexiteers criticised the Chequers deal and opposition MPs sought to torment the prime minister about her cabinet isions, she turned in a confident performance and emerged after a couple of hours without much damage. When she left the Commons chamber she went to a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee, the body that holds her fate in its hands.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThroughout the afternoon, rumours swept Westminster that 48 MPs had sent a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the committee, enough to trigger a no confidence vote. Before the meeting, Downing Street said that, if such a vote was triggered, May would fight to retain her position as leader.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the event, she was greeted with a clamour of desk-banging, and her speech calling for party unity and warning that isions risked handing power to Jeremy Corbyn was well-received.Interventions by Brexiteers criticising the Chequers plan were apparently outnumbered by those of MPs expressing support for the prime minister.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Everyone in the room is very confident of her ability to deliver. We are a wide tent, of course, with different views. This is the right package for our country,” said party chairman Brandon Lewis. \u0026nbspContrary to the rumours, the 1922 Committee did not trigger a confidence vote and the prime minister left the meeting to applause."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558784.1531124733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us opposition to breastfeeding motion stuns world health officials","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA young mother breastfeeding her infant daughter. Photograph: Getty ImagesiStockphotoA resolution to encourage breastfeeding was expected to be approved quickly and easily by the hundreds of government delegates who gathered this spring in Geneva for the United Nations-affiliated World Health Assembly. Based on decades of research, the resolution says that mother’s milk is healthiest for children and countries should strive to limit the inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes. Then the US delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations. American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to “protect, promote and support breastfeeding” and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.When that failed, they turned to threats, according to diplomats and government officials who took part in the discussions. Ecuador, which had planned to introduce the measure, was the first to find itself in the cross hairs. The Americans were blunt: If Ecuador refused to drop the resolution, Washington would unleash punishing trade measures and withdraw crucial military aid. The Ecuadorean government quickly acquiesced. The showdown over the issue was recounted by more than a dozen participants from several countries, many of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the United States. Health advocates scrambled to find another sponsor for the resolution, but at least a dozen countries, most of them poor nations in Africa and Latin America, backed off, citing fears of retaliation, according to officials from Uruguay, Mexico and the United States.“We were astonished, appalled and also saddened,” said Patti Rundall, policy director of the British advocacy group Baby Milk Action, who has attended meetings of the assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, since the late 1980s.“What happened was tantamount to blackmail, with the US holding the world hostage and trying to overturn nearly 40 years of consensus on the best way to protect infant and young child health,” she said. In the end, the Americans’ efforts were mostly unsuccessful. It was the Russians who ultimately stepped in to introduce the measure – and the Americans did not threaten them. The State Department declined to respond to questions, saying it could not discuss private diplomatic conversations. The US Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency in the effort to modify the resolution, explained the decision to contest the resolution’s wording but said HHS was not involved in threatening Ecuador.“The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children,” an HHS spokesman said in an email. “We recognise not all women are able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatised for the ways in which they are able to do so.” The spokesman asked to remain anonymous in order to speak more freely.Although lobbyists from the baby food industry attended the meetings in Geneva, health advocates said they saw no direct evidence that they played a role in Washington’s strong-arm tactics. The €60 billion industry, which is dominated by a handful of US and European companies, has seen sales flatten in wealthy countries in recent years, as more women embrace breastfeeding. Overall, global sales are expected to rise by 4 per cent in 2018, according to Euromonitor, with most of that growth occurring in developing nations.The intensity of the administration’s opposition to the breastfeeding resolution stunned public health officials and foreign diplomats, who described it as a marked contrast to the Obama administration, which largely supported the WHO’s long-standing policy of encouraging breastfeeding.During the deliberations, some American delegates even suggested the United States might cut its contribution to the WHO, several negotiators said. Washington is the single largest contributor to the health organisation, providing $845 million (€720 million), or roughly 15 per cent of its budget, last year. The confrontation was the latest example of the Trump administration siding with corporate interests on numerous public health and environmental issues. In talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Americans have been pushing for language that would limit the ability of Canada, Mexico and the United States to put warning labels on junk food and sugary beverages, according to a draft of the proposal reviewed by the New York Times.During the same Geneva meeting where the breastfeeding resolution was debated, the United States succeeded in removing statements supporting soda taxes from a document that advises countries grappling with soaring rates of obesity. The Americans also sought, unsuccessfully, to thwart a WHO effort aimed at helping poor countries obtain access to lifesaving medicines. Washington, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, has long resisted calls to modify patent laws as a way of increasing drug availability in the developing world, but health advocates say the Trump administration has ratcheted up its opposition to such efforts.The delegation’s actions in Geneva are in keeping with the tactics of an administration that has been upending alliances and long-established practices across a range of multilateral organisations, from the Paris climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal to Nafta. Ilona Kickbusch, director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said there was a growing fear that the Trump administration could cause lasting damage to international health institutions like the WHO that have been vital in containing epidemics like Ebola and the rising death toll from diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the developing world.“It’s making everyone very nervous, because if you can’t agree on health multilateralism, what kind of multilateralism can you agree on?” Kickbusch asked. A Russian delegate said the decision to introduce the breastfeeding resolution was a matter of principle. “We’re not trying to be a hero here, but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world,” said the delegate, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.He said the United States did not directly pressure Moscow to back away from the measure. Nevertheless, the US delegation sought to wear down the other participants through procedural manoeuvres in a series of meetings that stretched on for two days, an unexpectedly long period.In the end, the United States was largely unsuccessful. The final resolution preserved most of the original wording, though American negotiators did get language removed that called on the WHO to provide technical support to member states seeking to halt “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children”.The United States also insisted that the words “evidence-based” accompany references to long-established initiatives that promote breastfeeding, which critics described as a ploy that could be used to undermine programmes that provide parents with feeding advice and support.Elisabeth Sterken, director of the Infant Feeding Action Coalition in Canada, said four decades of research have established the importance of breast milk, which provides essential nutrients as well as hormones and antibodies that protect newborns against infectious disease.A 2016 study in the Lancet found that universal breastfeeding would prevent 800,000 child deaths a year across the globe and yield €250 billion in savings from reduced health care costs and improved economic outcomes for those reared on breast milk.Scientists are loath to carry out double-blind studies that would provide one group with breast milk and another with breast milk substitutes. “This kind of ‘evidence-based’ research would be ethically and morally unacceptable,” Sterken said.Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago-based company that is one of the biggest players in the $70 billion baby food market, declined to comment. Nestlé, the Switzerland-based food giant with significant operations in the United States, sought to distance itself from the threats against Ecuador and said the company would continue to support the international code on the marketing of breast milk substitutes, which calls on governments to regulate the inappropriate promotion of such products and to encourage breastfeeding.In addition to the trade threats, Todd C Chapman, the US ambassador to Ecuador, suggested in meetings with officials in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, that the Trump administration might also retaliate by withdrawing the military assistance it has been providing in northern Ecuador, a region wracked by violence spilling across the border from Colombia, according to an Ecuadorean government official who took part in the meeting.The US Embassy in Quito declined to make Chapman available for an interview. “We were shocked because we didn’t understand how such a small matter like breastfeeding could provoke such a dramatic response,” said the Ecuadorean official, who asked not to be identified because she was afraid of losing her job. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Women more likely than men to think cat-calling is acceptableInmates will be given phones in cells in attempt to curb violenceUniversities forced to lower grades for poor students complain they will plummet down league tables Eurosceptics fury as May\u0026#39s CabinetWimbledon crowd can watch World Cup on their phones in break with traditionComment: Is anyone brave enough to sign Theresa May\u0026#39s death warrant?Novichok poisoning: Probe spreads to Swindon where police seize car as second victim could have just days to liveComment: Brexit was supposed to be about taking back control, not being governed by the back doorMarks \u0026amp Spencer runs out of waistcoats ahead of \u0026#39Waistcoat Wednesday\u0026#39RAF running out of funds while government \u0026#39bangs on\u0026#39 about cyber threat, says former defence chief Plan to reproduce Northern White Rhinos in test tubes is “madness”, says BBC wildlife presenterChurch of England sees fall in planned donations for first time in 50 years as millennials fail to engageDrugs crisis in Indian state \u0026#39more deadly than 15 years of terrorism\u0026#39 as government employees to be testedJacob Rees-Mogg sees the funny side as Channel 4\u0026#39s Jon Snow tells protesters to \u0026#39shut up\u0026#39 in live interviewJeremy Hunt new Foreign Secretary after resignation of Boris Johnson Comment: Her Government, and Brexit, are in meltdown.

He defeated a coalition of opposition parties in a snap election last month to hold onto power. Turkey is entering a new era with the presidential oath ceremony on Monday, Mr Erdogan told members of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) ahead of the swearing in. With the power granted to us by the new presidential system, we will get quicker and stronger results.”Mr Erdogan has largely ruled by fiat since 2016, when he imposed a state of emergency on the country in response to a failed coup attempt against him. The president has promised to lift the emergency conditions later this month but in the hours before his swearing in he used to issue two more edicts. Mr Erdogan has ruled Turkey for 15 years alreadyOne was to dismiss 18,000 civil servants, half of them from the police force. Around 180,000 state employees have been sacked for alleged ties to the coup plotters. More than 60,000 people have been arrested. The second decree was to remove term limits for the governor of Turkey’s central bank, suggesting Mr Erdogan may be looking to curb the bank’s independence and install a loyalist in the governor’s office for the long term. The Turkish lira has lost around 20 per cent of its value in the last six months, leading to rising prices. Mr Erdogan has railed against shadowy forces trying he accuses of pushing for high interest rates and hinted he would take more direct control of the bank in his new term.  Western leaders largely shunned Mr Erdogan’s swearing in ceremony at the presidential palace in Ankara, but a number of authoritarian leaders were present including Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Viktor Orban of Hungary. Several authoritarian leaders attended the swearing in Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister of Russia, also attended alongside Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister. Mr Erdogan will attend this week’s Nato summit in Brussels amid strained relations between Turkey and other members of the military alliance. Please review our commenting policyUniversities forced to lower grades for poor students complain they will plummet down league tables Women more likely than men to think cat-calling is acceptableInmates will be given phones in cells in attempt to curb violenceEurosceptics fury as May\u0026#39s CabinetWimbledon crowd can watch World Cup on their phones in break with traditionComment: Is anyone brave enough to sign Theresa May\u0026#39s death warrant?Novichok poisoning: Probe spreads to Swindon where police seize car as second victim could have just days to liveComment: Brexit was supposed to be about taking back control, not being governed by the back doorMarks \u0026amp Spencer runs out of waistcoats ahead of \u0026#39Waistcoat Wednesday\u0026#39RAF running out of funds while government \u0026#39bangs on\u0026#39 about cyber threat, says former defence chief Plan to reproduce Northern White Rhinos in test tubes is “madness”, says BBC wildlife presenterChurch of England sees fall in planned donations for first time in 50 years as millennials fail to engageDrugs crisis in Indian state \u0026#39more deadly than 15 years of terrorism\u0026#39 as government employees to be testedJacob Rees-Mogg sees the funny side as Channel 4\u0026#39s Jon Snow tells protesters to \u0026#39shut up\u0026#39 in live interviewJeremy Hunt new Foreign Secretary after resignation of Boris Johnson Comment: Her Government, and Brexit, are in meltdown.

But large numbers were killed in the early 1900s by a mysterious epidemic, and their population was then devastated as foxes spread across south-eastern Australia.The new pups offering hope to a species of marsupial devastated by foxesThey were last regularly seen on the mainland in the 1960s in the Sydney region.Australian National University researcher Natasha Robinson said the new colony had demonstrated several vital points needed for a successful long-term future.We\u0027ve proven the quolls can find food, shelter and breed. We\u0027ve also shown a capacity to make changes to improve the quolls survival rate, she said.Please review our commenting policyWomen more likely than men to think cat-calling is acceptableInmates will be given phones in cells in attempt to curb violenceUniversities forced to lower grades for poor students complain they will plummet down league tables Eurosceptics fury as May\u0026#39s CabinetWimbledon crowd can watch World Cup on their phones in break with traditionComment: Is anyone brave enough to sign Theresa May\u0026#39s death warrant?Novichok poisoning: Probe spreads to Swindon where police seize car as second victim could have just days to liveComment: Brexit was supposed to be about taking back control, not being governed by the back doorMarks \u0026amp Spencer runs out of waistcoats ahead of \u0026#39Waistcoat Wednesday\u0026#39RAF running out of funds while government \u0026#39bangs on\u0026#39 about cyber threat, says former defence chief Plan to reproduce Northern White Rhinos in test tubes is “madness”, says BBC wildlife presenterChurch of England sees fall in planned donations for first time in 50 years as millennials fail to engageDrugs crisis in Indian state \u0026#39more deadly than 15 years of terrorism\u0026#39 as government employees to be testedJacob Rees-Mogg sees the funny side as Channel 4\u0026#39s Jon Snow tells protesters to \u0026#39shut up\u0026#39 in live interviewJeremy Hunt new Foreign Secretary after resignation of Boris Johnson Comment: Her Government, and Brexit, are in meltdown.

These decentralised technologies have the potential to upend everything we thought we knew about the nature of financial systems and financial assets, said Professor William Knottenbelt from Imperial.Bitcoin price recovers from eight-month low“There’s a lot of scepticism over cryptocurrencies and how they could ever become a day-to-day payment system used by the man on the street. In this research we show that cryptocurrencies have already made significant headway towards fulfilling the criteria for becoming a widely accepted method of payment.”Should cryptocurrencies continue to progress in terms of functionality, Professor Knottenbelt\u0026nbspsaid they represent a viable technological update to the way we spend money.\u0026nbspConsidering each evolutionary iteration of money has made the process of paying for something easier, the research paper concludes that the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies make them the next natural step towards reducing the friction of payments.One possible way this could happen\u0026nbspwould be for cross-border payments, which currently involve lengthy and costly transaction times. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies mean they are borderless by design, and therefore negate such issues.The history of money is a history of evolution, of new technology replacing old to improve the transfer of value from one person to another. Cryptocurrencies represent a next step on this journey, said Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of eToro.​Given the speed of adoption, we believe that we could see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the high street within the decade.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesIndonesia worker and firefighters try to extinguish a fire on fishing boats at Benoa harbour in Denpasar, on Indonesia\u0027s resort island of Bali.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Brexit Secretary David Davis had a prominent role leading Britains Brexit negotiations in Brussels but has now resigned.Last July a study found more than a fifth of Conservatives wanted him to take as PM.But the latest polls of party members shows his support has slipped behind potential rivals.Mr Davis previously stood for the party leadership in 2001 and 2005 coming fourth and second respectively.His working-class roots also distance him from the view of Tories as out-of-touch toffs.But he has also been accused of being thick and lazy and there were calls for him to be held in contempt of Parliament over non-existent impact papers.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign, and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown...A reshuffle is an informal term for the PM switching around jobs in the Cabinet.Ministers can be moved between departments or booted to the back benches as the head of government decides on her new team.Reshuffles are common following elections, high profile resignations, deaths or retirements and also in the wake of bad press.Mrs Mays Government was thrown into disarray as Mr Davis and then Mr Johnson said they could not see themselves fully supporting her soft Brexit plans.The most recent Cabinet reshuffle took place on July 9 after David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary.He was replaced by Dominic Raab, another Leave supporter who is willing to support the PMs strategy over the EU exit.However, the reshuffle really went into overdrive when Boris Johnson resigned following a day of speculation.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was summoned to Downing Street and was confirmed as the new Foreign Secretary shortly after.This, in turn, led to Matt Hancock leaving DCMS for the Health Department and Jeremy Wright, the Attorney General, being moved to fill Mr Hancocks spot."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

They were comically normal.She was seventeen and, until then, what Sally had known was anything but normal. Raised in grimy, chaotic disorder, her childhood was so dysfunctional that at fourteen, she put herself into care - a brave and highly unusual decision.Shared with three siblings and an assortment of cousins, home was a filthy, ramshackle house in a small town on the Sussex coast presided over by her mother Ange, grandmother Maze and her Aunt Di.Her mum, Sally recalls, was very beautiful, but also feeble. She was chronically dis-empowered. My father was a non-presence and my aunt Di was the father figure.From an early age I was frightened of her as she was full of anger – she had these torrents of rage which came out of nowhere and which were terrifying for a child.Sally has recently written a book about her escape from her childhood. In it, she recalls her mother as initially affectionate, with a love of music and poetry which she passed on to her only daughter.But she was far from practical. Food, when it came, was inconsistent, while mould lined the bath and some of the walls. None of the adults worked, and money was scarce.This already shambolic set-up took a darker turn when Sally’s baby brother David – the youngest of her three siblings – died in mysterious circumstances when she was around three years old.It was hard for her young brain to process, and even today she declines to go into the details of precisely what happened. When a child dies it is too painful, and I think all the adults have their own versions of what happened, is all she will say.The effect was catastrophic on her mother, who retreated to her bed for the greater part of a year. When she emerged, was barely present.Something took over - she retreated more and more from herself, says Sally.Aunt Di, meanwhile, had started a semi-religious movement which saw endless characters coming and going from the house and speaking in tongues.My mother got sucked into this, says Sally. I remember the first time I heard her speaking in tongues – she seemed possessed. I asked her if she was speaking Greek but later she explained to me that it was word of God.I did go to school, but other than that there was very little engagement with the real world. We didn’t have a social life, we couldn’t invite people back to our house because of the state it was in. So it was left to us to create our own world.By the age of 11, and looking for an escape from reality, Sally had become a devout reader and consumed most of the classics.Yet as she entered her teens, even her beloved books couldnt stem her growing unease with her chaotic household. There was a lack of belonging, a sense I didn’t fit, she says now.She was also thin, and hungry, and she made an appointment to see her local doctor to ask for help.In the book, she recalls how she told him she was very different from the rest of her family. Sometimes, it’s like living in a zoo, she says. I’m the strange animal that doesn’t belong ... the thing in the corner.The doctor saw and heard enough to involve Social Services and some months later an alarmingly underweight Sally was taken away from her house by ambulance, never to return.It was a very difficult, conflicted time and there are things that happened which are quite horrible, she says quietly. I don’t like to spell it out but the book I return to time and again as reference is Jane Eyre which is a very violent book.Ultimately my aunt and my mother saw what I did as an act of betrayal so I was sent into exile.After being treated in hospital Sally was sent to a care home - a place of cold linoleum floors and bars on the windows which proved a different sort of challenge.It was pretty grim, she recalls now. There was no library, so I struggled. Although there was one teacher who used to bring in books for me.The one salvation was that, for all her isolation as a child, Sally got on well with the other girls, taking on the role of the big sister.And after pushing to attend the local sixth form college, she befriended a fellow student whose family offered to take her in while she studied for her A-levels. It was the turning point - her first experience of normal family life.Her A-levels led her to a degree at St Andrews University, courtesy of a special grant organised by Social Services.Then, at 22, she moved to America to teach, returning to the UK in 2004 to join Oxford University as a lecturer in English Literature.By then she was back in touch with her mother, Ange – who she had not seen since leaving home in the mid-eighties.We managed a relationship of sorts, but it was difficult, although I forgave her because I always knew she was broken.Ange died from cancer in 2009, although Sally remains in contact with her brothers.Today, Sally lives in tranquil peace in a houseboat on The Thames just outside Oxford.Its a far cry from the environment in which she grew up.But perhaps what is even more unusual is what she went on to achieve: today 45-year-old Sally has a glittering academic career and is a highly respected lecturer in English Literature at Oxford University.It’s a journey she has now vividly recreated in her own book, Girl With Dove, in which she tells the story of her unorthodox childhood and her desperate attempt to escape it.And, astoundingly, today she feels no bitterness about what she went through.In many ways I had an extraordinary childhood which I’m grateful for, she says.There were huge freedoms which came with that benign neglect. But I am also glad I got out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This fudge is the result of the PM’s dithering and failure to plan for “no deal” — that essential weapon of any negotiator’s armoury.Had she won the 100-plus majority predicted before last year’s election things would be different. But her disastrous campaign put paid to that.Michael Gove claims her Chequers offer would secure Brexit and free us to move further away in time. We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them. Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.MICHAEL Fallon is right to try to stop ­taxpayers’ cash being used to reopen cases from the Troubles.Our ageing veterans live in fear of arrest for difficult decisions taken decades ago in a war zone.This witch-hunt MUST end.OUR boys’ World Cup success is set to cause a baby boom as randy fans celebrate by romping.If the Three Lions deliver us the World Cup there will be a BOOM in certain names, too.Expect some Harrys and Gareths.

but it was backed by a teaching union.Dad Martin Macdonald, of Bucksburn, Aberdeen, said: “It’s quite ridiculous. Children shouldn’t be missing out because of their parents’ actions.”Shop worker and mum Christine Dines said: “It’s a bit extreme and the kids shouldn’t be punished for this.”Minister and father-of-two Barry Douglas, from Bridge of Don, said: “We live in a world of social media where things happen quickly, so it could be a heat of the moment thing of frustration where a parent has a rant.”The council’s Liberal Democrat education spokesman Martin Greig said: “Parents have a right and a duty to express their views about their child’s education.“If there are any concerns or questions these need to be encouraged and taken seriously.“The council should not try and stop parents from giving comments. Their attitude is setting up barriers instead of building up trust.”It’s understood teachers were concerned by posts in which members of parenting groups complained about school facilities.Ron Constable of the EIS union said: “It is particularly troubling that this abuse is being conducted where children and young people are able to witness this behaviour including inappropriate language and intimidation.“The abuse of members over social media is a major concern for the EIS in Aberdeen and we have experienced a significant increase in the number of members seeking advice about this issue.”The city council said: “The council’s policy, which has been in place for a number of years, states that the inappropriate use of social media by either pupil or parent making derogatory comments in relation to a pupil, staff member or school is likely to lead to exclusion.“We always encourage parents to use social media responsibly and we would only consider exclusion as a last resort.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419223396.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince louis godparents queen prince philip miss christening","story":"The 11-week-old prince slept peacefully as a host of Royals filed out of the exclusive ceremony -

a replica of the robe made for Queen Victorias eldest daughter in 1841.The ceremony was conducted by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.As Kate chatted to the him while holding Louis, she could be heard describing her sleeping son as very relaxed and peaceful.The duchess added, with a smile: I hope he stays like this.Meghan looked stylish, dressed in an olive-green Ralph Lauren outfit and Stephen Jones hat.Charles and Camilla were also in attendance, arriving shortly before Kate and Wills.Pregnant Pippa Middleton was among the first guests to arrive.Wearing a blue dress, Kates sister headed to the service alongside her cousin Lucy, who is also one of Prince Louiss godparents.The proud aunt, 34, was pictured outside ahead of the intimate ceremony.Buckingham Palace today said the decision that the Queen and her 97-year-old husband would be absent had been made some time ago and was not due to health reasons.Instead, the ever-busy monarch will be on the road ahead of a busy week of engagements that include President Donald Trumps visit to Windsor this Friday.It comes after Kensington Palace today announced Prince Louis six godparents - all close friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.Those given the role of godparents include Nicholas van Cutsem, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Carter and Lucy Middleton.Also among the close-knit group of guests at this afternoons event will be doting grandparents Prince Charles and Camilla.The Queens absence from todays event comes after she was forced to pull out of a morning service at St Pauls Cathedral last month.The monarch missed the event as she was feeling under the weather.But the great-grandmother was soon able to recover to take up her normal schedule.Prince Philip will also be missing for todays christening, having recently pulled back from engagements.The 11-week-old prince wore the handmade replica of the Royal Christening Robe, made by Angela Kelly, Dressmaker to The Queen.Its the same gown that was worn by his older sister Princess Charlotte and big brother Prince George.The little royal, who was born in April, will be christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.Tweeting this morning, the Archbishop wrote: I’m delighted and privileged to be christening Prince Louis today – a precious child made in God’s image, just as we all are. Please join me in praying for him and his family on this special day.The Lily Font and water from the River Jordan will be used during the baptism.Kensington Palace today revealed details of this afternoons christening, saying the guests would be served a slice of cake preserved from Prince William and Kate Middletons wedding day.A private tea will then be held at Clarence House.It comes after it was revealed Prince Harry has paid around £8,000 for a first edition Winnie-The-Pooh for his nephews big day.The 33-year-old newlywed plans to start an exclusive library for the young Prince, in tribute to his late mother, Princess Diana.A friend said: “One of Harry’s happiest childhood memories was being read a bedtime story by his mother.She loved all the old classics and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte and George to enjoy as they get older.They added the doting uncle had originally wanted to get Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass, but decided on Winnie-The-Pooh."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419038616.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brussels slam theresa mays have cake and eat it brexit plan and says david davis is a rat leaving a sinking ship","story":"The EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker stuck the boot in - observing the pair’s decision to quit “clearly proves that at Chequers there was a big unity of views in the British Cabinet”.And his EU Council counterpart Donald Tusk also weighed in to say who knows if the chaos will now see the UK’s historic vote to leave the bloc reversed.He tweeted: “Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain.“I can only regret that the idea of #Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson.  But...who knows?”Senior figures in Brussels have taken aim at Mr Davis for choosing to step away from the talks at such a crucial moment, saying they are like “rats leaving a sinking ship”.An EU diplomat saying: The resignation will be framed as not taking responsibility for a soft Brexit but looks more like not taking responsibility at all.“It is starting to look like the flight of the Brexiteers.With suggestions other leading Eurosceptics in the Government could resign too, another diplomat said: They [Brexiteers] landed your country in a mess and now they’re leaving for higher ground.Rats and sinking ships, that age old tale.But in a withering assessment of his role, several Brussels figures suggest it will not actually make any difference to the talks.One diplomat told The Sun: Its not going to lead to a substantial change in the Brexit negotiations because in the last couple of months David Davis wasnt any more the main negotiator, it was Olly Robbins.”Another said: The article 50 negotiation has so far taken up several hundreds of hours in negotiation. Of which minister Davis was here for four this year.His role has always been more defined in London. So that’s where they will have to look at the consequences. On this end we will just negotiate with whomever the UK government sends here to do so.But the EU Commission officially said it had no specific comment to make on Mr Daviss resignation, adding: Well continue to negotiate in good faith with PM May and the UK government.”Brussels has also slammed Theresa Mays “have cake and eat it” new Brexit plan with claims EU bosses will need her to water it down even more.Mr Davis resigned saying the PM was pursuing a dangerous strategy he could no longer support, after she finally got her Cabinet to sign off on a basis for talks with the EU.And Mrs May faces a further headache after the Irish deputy PM says the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier will find it “difficult” to accept the proposal agreed at Chequers on Friday.This is because it will keep the UK tied to the EU’s rules but only on goods and agricultural products – and Mrs May has repeatedly been warned this approach is “cherry-picking” and will not be approved.Mr Barnier said the discussions at Chequers, the PM’s country estate – are “to be welcomed”, but said he said needed to asses if they are “workable and realistic” ahead of discussions on July 16.But he said he needed to see the full proposals in the Government’s long-await White Paper – expected this week. .This was echoed by others in Brussels, with one diplomatic source telling the Daily Mail: “It’s about the White Paper at the moment. It’s important to wait for that detail. We can’t be sure about anything until we see it.“But what is being said about goods still has a ‘have cake and eat it’ feeling. That will be the sticking point.“The way it’s seen in relation to the single market is, you don’t just swallow one bit, you swallow all of it.”And Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy PM and minister for foreign affairs, said: “The EU has never been keen to facilitate a breaking up of an approach toward the single market in terms of keeping all of the elements of the single market intact and consistent, so I think Britain will find it difficult to persuade the EU to support the approach they’re now proposing.“Michel Barnier will be a very, very strong defender of the EU interests here, in terms of protecting the integrity of the single market and the integrity of the EU customs union.”And another diplomatic source was scathing of the plan, telling The Observer: “A goulash gets better the more it is recooked.“I am not sure about whether the customs proposals share the same quality.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If we cant bring the demand down for water, that would be the next logical step, and that could be in days rather than weeks.The UK’s first hosepipe ban of the year was brought in in Northern Ireland on June 29.Water firms have begged customers to cut back on use with Southern Water asking people to spend no longer than four minutes in the shower.The North West has seen devastating wildfires over recent weeks with on both Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill near Bolton.It comes as Brits will welcome their 50th consecutive day of sunshine tomorrow as the country continues to bake in a record-breaking heatwave.Temperatures are today expected to reach 30C, making it the 16th day in a row hotter than 28C.And while the mercury is expected to dip slightly tomorrow, temperatures are predicted to climb back up to the high 20s by the weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"princess charlotte handshake waves prince louis christening","story":"The three-year-old was seen confidently shaking hands with the Archbishop of Canterbury and The Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Right Reverend and Right Honourable the Lord Chartres before heading inside for the ceremony.Prince William could then be heard telling Charlotte: “Well done”.Later as she left the ceremony, the confident young Royal showed off her sunny nature as she gave a cheery wave to crowds gathered outside the chapel at St James’ Palace, carrying the large Order of Service under her arm.Princess Charlotte has regularly outshone her older brother George with her confidence and love of the public.While George, four, is often seen shying away from the cheering crowds, Charlotte is seen taking it all in her stride, delighting onlookers with her natural charm.And it’s not the first time that the little Princess has left hearts bursting with affection.At just 16 months old, she charmed the world by waving to crowds in Canada.And last year, she proved she was ever the professional when she greeted well-wishers during a tour of Germany and Poland, accepting bouquets and even performing her first curtsy.Her adorable nature was also fully on display when she and Prince George arrived at the Lindo wing in April to meet the newest little Cambridge.Princess Charlotte was seen waving to crowds the moment she stepped out of the car, and made the most of her moment in the spotlight by turning back on the hospital steps for one final wave before heading to meet her baby brother.Prince Louis’ birth also made Charlotte the first female Royal to retain her claim as third in line to the throne regardless of who was born after her."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004192040081.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may housing ministers slammed","story":"Kit Malthouse was given the post after Dominic Raab was promoted amid the Cabinet chaos to replace David Davis as Brexit Secretary.Mr Malthouse – elected in 2015 as MP for North-West Hampshire – becomes the fourth in the post since Theresa May took over in No.10 in mid-2016.And he’s the eighth Housing Minister since David Cameron’s coalition won power in 2010.The British Property Federation said that regardless of the political circumstances, the revolving door had to stop.Melanie Leech, the trade body’s chief exec, said: “The housing sector will be frustrated with yet one more housing minister.May 2010 – September 2012 Grant ShappsSep 2012 – Oct 2013 Mark PriskOct 2013 – July 2014 Kris HopkinsJuly 2014 – July 2016 Brandon LewisJuly 2016 – June 2017 Gavin BarwellJune 2017 – Jan 2018 Alok SharmaJan 2018 – July 2018 Dominic RaabJuly 2018 - Kit Malthouse“The national interest must come first.”Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey added: “This is no way to run a Government.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

The Cabinet Minister, appointed by Prime Minister Theresa May to handle Brexit after the resignation of David Davis, is a long-term supporter of leaving the EU to cut regulations protecting employees.  Both Labour and the Trade Unions have expressed concerns about his appointment. He is the co-author of the hard-right \u0027Britannia Unchained\u0027 manifesto in 2012. Britannia Unchained was written by Kwasi Kwarteng MP, Priti Patel MP, Dominic Raab MP, Chris Skidmore MP and Liz Truss MP.  The book claimed British workers ‘prefer a lie-in to hard work’ and that British people ‘are amongst the worst idlers in the world’. This follows Raab\u0027s proposals in a pamphlet published by the Centre for Policy Studies in 2011 entitled \u0027Escaping the Strait Jacket\u0027.  In it he argues that should the UK leave the EU this should be seen as an opportunity to slash protections for workers. Referring to David Cameron\u0027s attempts renegotiate Britain\u0027s relationship with the EU, Mr Raab wrote: “This opportunity should be seized, and used to remove some of the obstacles to British business.”  He writes: cutting the cost of EU social regulations by 50% could result in a boost to economic output equivalent to the creation of 140,000 new jobs in the UK. Raab\u0027s pamphlet includes proposals to: -Abolish the minimum wage for workers aged under 21 working in small businesses -Abolish the working time directive which protects workers from having to work unfair hours -Scrap employment rights for agency workers’ rights and conditions -End transfer of undertakings (tupe) regulations protecting workers when their job is transferred to a new employer -Ensure workers employed by small businesses don\u0027t benefit from flexible working rights or pension auto-enrolment Paul Blomfield, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Minister, said: “The new Brexit Secretary has long harboured ambitions to slash vital workplace protections and rights, and the Prime Minister has now put him in a position to do so. “This latest blow for workers comes a few days after the Cabinet failed to rule out a race to the bottom with the EU on crucial employment protection. It’s become abundantly clear once again that this chaotic Tory Government cannot be trusted with people’s rights after Brexit.”  Tim Roache, GMB General Secretary said:  “This appointment signals a promotion of a hard right figurehead who has shown contempt for working people in Britain.   “Theresa May has appointed someone who think British workers are lazy and have too many rights and he has already published plans to slash vital rights from the minimum wage to rights for agency workers.

Kit Malthouse was named today as the eighth Tory Housing Minister in eight years - taking on Theresa May\u0027s stalled pledge to fix the broken market. But he can expect scrutiny over his previous approach to homelessness when he was deputy leader of Westminster City Council, which he left in 2006. Under his watch, the council was accused by one London Assembly member of adopting a ruthless policy towards homeless people that included hosing them out of doorways.  Asked in 2008 if he was behind such a hosing policy, Mr Malthouse replied: We certainly instituted a policy of making life - it sounds counterintuitive and cruel - more uncomfortable that is absolutely right.   He added during the 2008 hearing: One of the targets [I was] set was to more than halve the number in Westminster. Working with a number of charities and groups across Westminster we analysed the problem, and one of the issues was that in many ways - it sounds counterintuitive - life was too comfortable on the street. I know that sounds an awful thing to say but let me finish the argument, OK? There were, at the time, plenty, well-funded - we managed to get quite a lot of funding - night shelters and night centres we managed to extract a cheque for \u0026pound130,000 for St. Martin’s so it could stay open all night. The difficulty was getting rough sleepers into those centres so that they could be interacted with, their needs could be met.  In 2004, after 27 homeless people were arrested in a joint operation between the council and police, Mr Malthouse suggested the zero tolerance policy could be adopted by other areas.  The Independent quoted him as saying: The idea that everyone begging is down on their luck is a fantasy.  At the time of the 2008 accusations, by then-London Assembly member Jenny Jones, Mr Malthouse strongly defended his record and flatly denied being ruthless. The work we did in Westminster was welcomed by almost all the charities, he said. But a Labour local government spokesman said today: In her desperation, Theresa May has appointed a new Housing Minister whose callous disregard for the lives of homeless people should immediately rule him out of the job. We desperately need a Government prepared to tackle this crisis, but with a divided and shambolic Government this country is at a standstill. The Prime Minister has zero authority left.  Mr Malthouse, who was a Work and Pensions Minister, was named the new Housing Minister today after Dominic Raab was promoted to Brexit Secretary by crisis-hit Theresa May.   The Prime Minister has vowed to completely eliminate rough sleeping by 2027 - despite it more than doubling since the Tories took power.

The Prime Minister has been severely weakened after losing Brexiteers David Davis and then Boris Johnson - who revealed they could not support her customs deal hammered out at Chequers on Friday. But in a major clash with Tory Brexiteers, Theresa May has vowed to fight on. Asked whether May would contest any vote on a confidence motion in her leadership, her spokesman said today: Yes. A leadership challenge can be triggered if 15% of Tory MPs write a letter to the chairman of the party\u0027s 1922 Committee. The Conservatives currently have 316 MPs so 48 of them would need to write such letters to challenge Mrs May.  Once that threshold has been reached, the chairman will announce the start of the contest and invite nominations - but Mrs May is completely eligible to stand again. If several names are put forward to lead the party, then a vote is held among Conservative MPs using the first past the post system to whittle down the field with the candidate with the fewest votes removed.  Another ballot among Conservative MPs is then held until two candidates remain. The final two nominees are then put to a ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership with the winner named the new leader. Jacob Rees Mogg  The hardcore Brexiteer, who is often referred to as the honorable member for the 18th century, is incredibly popular with the Tory membership who are crucial for any leadership hopeful. Mr Rees-Mogg is very firmly on the backbenches so becoming leader would be a big leap. The Catholic MP opposes abortion in any circumstances and same sex marriage. His election as Tory leader would represent a serious step backwards for those who have tried to remake the party for the 21st century.  Andrea Leadsom stood for the leadership against Theresa May but was forced to drop out after she implied she had a greater stake in society than the now PM because she had children. However Mrs Leadsom, who is on the right of the party and pro-Brexit, has since then become a loyal member of Mrs May\u0027s team. She has also shown herself to be a strong voice standing up for the victims of bullying of staff in Westminster and especially in supporting women in politics. Michael Gove  The Environment Secretary showed he had the ruthlessness to do whatever it takes to get power when he knifed Boris Johnson in the back by standing against him during the Tory leadership contest following David Cameron\u0027s resignation. He\u0027s shown himself to be a canny operator by taking his Environment brief and making it part of the national conversation with moves to ban plastic straws cutting through in the world beyond Westminster. Mr Gove has also shown he is loyal by backing the PM\u0027s Brexit customs plan on Friday and taking to the TV studios on Sunday to defend it.  The former Foreign Secretary has always been popular with grassroots Tories but in recent years his star has seemed to wane as his comical gaffes seemed less funny when played out on the world stage. He was completely wrong-footed when his former ally Michael Gove stood against him in the contest to take over from David Cameron. It also took him more than 15 hours to decide to quit his post after David Davis had done what he saw as the honorable thing. Boris\u0027s dithering in this, as on the issue whether or not to support Brexit in the first place, is not a good quality for a possible leader or Prime Minister. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But Brexiteers were enraged by this close link with Brussels and David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July. The UK\u0027s longest serving Health Secretary has shown he has incredible sticking power in a tough role. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister and has shown he can handle a crisis. Despite supporting Remain in the run-up to the referendum he has consistently backed Brexit since the result. But it\u0027s unclear whether he has the support from ordinary Tory members. Sajid Javid  According to a YouGov poll the Home Secretary is currently the most popular cabinet minister among Tory party members. Mr Javid, who has also served as housing secretary and within the business department, campaigned to stay in the EU but since the vote he has argued in favour of leaving. Since his appointment following Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation he has had to hit the ground running to deal with issues including the Windrush scandal and the Salisbury attack. He is seen as a competent political performer. David Gauke  The chaos of the last few weeks may cause for a steady hand. Justice Secretary David Gauke has shown he can get on with the job especially when faced with the difficult job as the Work and Pensions Secretary. He is a bit of an outside bet as he has very little name recognition beyond Westminster. But there is precedent for such a boring candidate winning the top job just as John Major did when Margaret Thatcher lost a vote of no confidence. Gavin Williamson  The Defence Secretary landed his huge promotion after proving his loyalty to Theresa May, helping her secure the leadership and get key votes through the Commons as her chief whip. His knowledge and understanding of Tory MPs in that role was second to none. However, since he\u0027s been in the defence job there\u0027s been little sign of that loyalty with well publicised calls for extra funding for the Armed Forces and clashing with the Treasury. He\u0027s been mocked as Private Pike and widely criticised for his undignified approach to diplomacy including telling Russia to shut up and go away. Despite his campaigning for more defence spending he has managed to upset fellow MPs and it is unclear how much support he would have in the wider party.  It is arguably David Davis who has caused this whole situation by resigning over Theresa May\u0027s Brexit customs compromise. But it is unclear whether he could reap the rewards of that decision. It would be the second time he had gone for the Tory top job losing out to David Cameron in 2005. His track record as a Brexiteer and it could play well with some of the party faithful that he has resigned to save the hard Brexit he supports. But his performance in the cabinet has also exposed him as a last minute operator who looks far too relaxed to lead the Tories never mind the country.

Year nine pupil Blake Fradley claims he was sent home by King Edward VI Sheldon Heath Academy, in Sheldon, Birmingham after explaining it was too hot to wear the jacket.  The 13-year-old\u0027s family said Blake was ordered not to return to school for a full week, BirminghamLive reports.  Now mum Lisa has spoken out - urging the school to reconsider their strict \u0027full uniform\u0027 policy during the blazing summer temperatures.  She explained how she had received a call from her son telling her staff had ordered him to wear his blazer.   He then added that he had been excluded for five days following the dispute.   He called me and said he had been excluded - I panicked and my mind was racing wondering what he had done, mum-of-three Lisa said. When he told me it was over a blazer I was stunned. He had been walking back into his form class when he was pulled aside by a teacher who ordered him to put his blazer back on, but he refused. He said it was ridiculously hot. Staff took the decision to exclude him for the next five days.      Blake will now be off school and staying at home until Friday, July 13 following the row. And as a result he has reportedly missed a Spanish exam.   His mum explained: He\u0027s really unhappy as he had a Spanish speaking exam which decides their sets for next year - he had been revising for it however as he\u0027s not there he hasn\u0027t been able to take the exam.   He\u0027s just been moping around the house since.  He is due to go on a school camping trip in the next few weeks. I now have no idea if this will go ahead the Sheldon mum added.

Linda Martin\u0027s daughter Maryanne Pilling, now 47, married the love of her life Tommy Pilling, who also has Down\u0027s syndrome, in July 1995. Nearly a quarter of a century on, the couple remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making incredible memories every day. But sadly, in recent years, Tommy, 60, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease - and continues to display early signs of it. He is getting more forgetful, while it is becoming harder for him to speak and be understood by those who aren\u0027t close to him.  His mum-in-law Linda explained what she and other loved ones have told Maryanne about his condition and what will happen in the future. At the moment, we just say that Tommy is getting older and he forgets things, and he needs a bit more care, she said in a new podcast. And that is enough for Maryanne to deal with at the moment. We go on a day -to-day basis. So at this moment, baby steps, she added.  Linda spoke out about her daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed Podcast as they prepare to celebrate 23 years of marriage.  The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony at a church in Shoeburyness, Essex, with Maryanne dressed in a Cinderella-style gown. More than two decades on, Maryanne, who lives with Tommy in Southend-on-Sea, tells her husband she loves him three times a day.  And whenever she speaks of him to others, her face lights up. As well as sharing tender embraces, the inspirational couple also go out to concerts, play football, laugh with loved ones and cook together. However, recently, Tommy has been getting more and more forgetful. Speaking in the podcast, host Jo mentioned his early signs of Alzheimer\u0027s and asked Linda whether she had spoken with her daughter about what happens when Tommy\u0027s gone. The mum, who also lives in Southend-on-Sea, replied: No, because I have to be very careful how I deal with things like that with Maryanne. Because when she was 12 her brother was killed and I have to be very careful how I approach things as far as that is concerned.  Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s love has defied both the odds and critics. While some have called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing her daughter to get married, others have deemed the couple\u0027s love disgusting. But as far as Linda is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for. She said: I wish I could have found a love like it in my life - because it\u0027s very honest, it\u0027s very true and it really is a beautiful thing. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection.  When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. In response, the couple said they wished to marry each other.  Linda then took the pair to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. In mid-July 1995, they finally tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy donned a made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel, according to the podcast, \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027, which was released last week. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  A Facebook page, set up by Lindi, follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance and has amassed more than 40,000 followers.   A post on the \u0027Maryanne and Tommy\u0027 page reveals that the couple renewed their wedding vows 13 years ago - then again three years ago. It adds: They have now been together for 28 years, since Maryanne was 19 years of age. Tommy is 13 years older than Maryanne and he recently celebrated turning 60! On World Down Syndrome day too! Their marriage is like a fairytale and they are the most blissfully happy couple that I know. I think most of us could learn a thing or two from them! When they got engaged 25 years ago many many people doubted them, said it was disgusting and they shouldn’t be allowed to get married, they also said that it would never work. But I like to say they are still as happy as they were 28 years ago when they first met. This page shows their love for one another quite clearly, it shows how happy they are, how much they adore each other and it proves to all the doubters that anything is possible with love.

From the first time the world saw the Cambridge family in its entirety, to the adorable moment Kate was caught beaming down at her baby boy. However there was another incredibly sweet moment that anyone who wasn\u0027t inside the chapel will have missed. During the ceremony, Kate and William paid a lovely tribute to Diana. And they did it through music. The official details of the christening, published by Kensington Palace informed the public that the processional organ music was the song \u0027Rhosymedre\u0027.   This hymn may be familiar to some, as it was also played at Diana\u0027s funeral.  Back in 1997 the piece of music was played before the funeral service by Stephen Le Prevost, Assistant Organist at Westminster Abbey.  The music selected for the christening also held a special tie to Kate and William\u0027s wedding.  The couple chose to feature the anthem \u0027This is the day which the Lord hath made\u0027 during their son\u0027s welcome into the Christian faith.  This song was composed for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding on April 29, 2011. The anthem was performed by The Choir of Her Majesty\u0027s Chapel Royal. After the short service the guests went back to Clarence House for a private tea, where pieces of Kate and William\u0027s wedding cake were served.  The christening marks the first time we\u0027ve seen Kate in public since the Trooping the Colour parade on June 9.

Royal fans turned out in their droves to get a glimpse of the little prince as he made his first appearance in public since being born. The peaceful sleeping young baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, was held in mum Kate\u0027s arms as she walked to the entrance of The Chapel Royal, St James\u0027s Palace, and later emerged beaming.

The baby prince has also grown a touch of fine hair over his head, and has a cute button nose.    Kate is completely smitten   The duchess looked completely in love with her youngest child, gazing down and smiling at him in her arms. She beamed with delight both before and after the 40-minute service in the Chapel Royal, St James\u0027s Palace, London.

The long-standing dilemma of how to tell whether you are out for a few drinks or out for the night was famously brought to the fore by comedian Micky Flanagan. Now a team of researchers have settled the dispute by revealing going ‘out-out’ means clearing your diary for the following day, going to a nightclub and staying out later than planned. Dodging a curfew set by your other half, know you\u0027ll need a lie in in the morning and can envision scoffing a kebab on the way, are also signs it\u0027s a big night out.  The study of 2,000 adults also found if you’re spending the evening with four of your closest friends and take around 39 minutes to get ready, then you will definitely be painting the town red. The research was commissioned by Malibu rum in celebration of National Pina Colada day, which takes place tomorrow. Jennie Bosson of Malibu said: “It was really interesting to see the different rituals people have, in order to make the most of their nights out. \u0027“Our research showed Brits love to socialise and go out, but modern life means we can’t always make the time for it.\u0027\u0027 It also emerged among the signs you’re going ‘out out’ are spending more money, having a quick power nap and using that special scent of aftershave or perfume. Nearly one in four agreed if you know you’re not getting the last train or bus home, then you’re definitely \u0027out-out\u0027.  Starting the night at 7:19pm at a friend’s house, followed by visiting three bars to indulge in Pina Coladas and Mojitos also make up a proper night out over a trip to the pub. Spending an average of \u0026pound68.82, after chatting to four people and wrapping up the night at 1.56am were also found to be signs of a night ‘out out’. Others said wearing ‘killer heels’ or shoes instead of trainers were also among the key indicators. The study also found Saturday is still the best night of the week to get dolled up and go out with friends, closely followed by a Friday night.  Nearly half of Brits would opt for a night ‘out out’ over a casual social gathering at the local pub, with more than a third in agreement they would rather dance the night away with pals of the same gender. The study found more than half agreed a night on the tiles it gives them a chance to have fun and three in 10 said it allows them to relax. Forty-five per cent said a night ‘out out’ allows them to catch up with friends, with once fifth saying it gives them a break from modern life. And more than a quarter found it gives them a chance to meet new people. Allowing themselves just one night a month to truly let their hair down, 38 per cent wished they went on ‘big nights out’ with friends more often. But half agreed busy schedules prevent Brits from enjoying themselves more often, with a surprising 57 per cent saying we are a nation who’d rather stay in. Forty-five per cent put it down to a lack of time, with more than seven in 10 saying Brits can’t afford it and nearly a third said friends are always the busy ones. Bosson added: \u0027\u0027It was great to see Pi\u0026ntildea Colada is in the top two of the nation’s favourite drinks when ‘out out’ especially in time for National Pi\u0026ntildea Colada Day. “We find that Malibu drinkers are the ultimate social butterflies and more likely to opt for a night ‘out out’ on the town than most.

The outfit is a design by Ralph Lauren, which she accompanied with matching shoes and clutch bag, as well as a hat by milliner Stephen Jones.  It\u0027s a very important occasion for the pair and Prince Harry managed to come up with an incredibly sweet present for his new nephew Louis.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

Green is a very important colour when it comes to colour psychology. It symbolises unconditional love for both ourselves and those around us - which could be a touching nod to her new in-laws. It also represents growth and rebirth - which is pretty prefect for a christening.  Green is also a soothing and relaxing colour, and can even help to alleviate anxiety, depression and nerves. Meghan attended the small service with hew husband Prince Harry. Kate Middleton carried a sleeping Prince Louis into the service, and William looked after Charlotte and George.  Prince Charles, Camilla, Pippa Middleton and other close relatives also attended the service at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. They were joined by Prince Louis godparents - Nicholas van Cutsem, Guy Pelly, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Laura Meade, Robert Carter and Lucy Middleton.

The \u0027Miami\u0027 outdoor table shattered in the heat sending deadly shards across her garden.  Paige Angela Tompkins, 23, took to social media to air her outrage and to warn other parents. Luckily for Paige, her three-year-old son Preston was sleeping inside at the time and not playing in the garden. But she says that despite her ordeal, Asda have refused to give her a refund. In her Facebook post she wrote: Warning to anyone who owns a Miami table set from Asda. Today mine has got so hot it\u0027s exploded leaving glass all over my garden.   She said Asda told her she would not get a refund because she had no receipt or packaging. This is not the first time that the specific piece of furniture has been at the centre of complaints.  A wave of reports surfaced in 2015 of glass tables spontaneously shattering for no apparent reason .  On that occasion, Barry Williams, from Drayton in Portsmouth, demanded Asda recall their \u0027Miami eight piece patio set\u0027. Responding to Paige\u0027s post, Sharon Drake commented: That\u0027s actually shocking. Me and your mum were sitting there yesterday! That\u0027s so bad thank god everyone\u0027s ok though.   Paige said: When I called them initially they didn\u0027t seem that interested, they told me, \u0027You won\u0027t be getting a refund\u0027. I was shocked that they didn\u0027t at least apologise and didn\u0027t want to recall the tables. Asda say they are aware of the issue and have been in contact with Paige.  A spokesman said: We are sorry for Ms Tompkins\u0027 experience and are in contact with her to try and resolve the situation.   We take no shortcuts when it comes to the safety of our products, which is why we only use toughened glass in our garden furniture and test to both British and European safety standards - meaning incidents like this are rare.

Queen Elizabeth, the world\u0027s oldest and longest-reigning living monarch, did miss a special service last month because she was feeling under the weather but she has carried out a number of public engagements since then. The monarch is due to return to London today ahead of a busy schedule of events including the RAF Centenary event tomorrow and a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday. On top of this, the Queen was reportedly working flat out in Scotland last week. It would seem she is simply not attending the christening due to work commitments. Her decision not to attend was mutually agreed with William and Kate, while Philip has avoided public events - unless he really has to - since his retirement in 2017. He will remain in Norfolk this week.  Kensington Palace said William\u0027s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla would be present along with younger brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle . Also attending are Kate\u0027s parents, her brother and sister and Prince Louis\u0027 six godparents , who are close friends or relatives of William and Kate. They include Kate\u0027s cousin Lucy Middleton, Nicholas van Cutsem, whose daughter was a bridesmaid at May\u0027s wedding of Harry and Meghan, and Guy Pelly, a childhood friend of William\u0027s. I\u0027m delighted and privileged to be christening Prince Louis today - a precious child made in God\u0027s image, just as we all are, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said on Twitter. Please join me in praying for him and his family on this special day.

But the sizzling summer could be brought to an abrupt end as tropical Storm Chris moves across the Atlantic. Expecting to pick up hurricane speed winds at sea, the Met Office predict Storm Chris will bring cooler temperatures and damper weather as we head towards the end of this week. Currently building on America\u0027s east coast, the tropical storm is likely to be upgraded to a hurricane in the next few days. Its ferocious winds are forecast to mix with current weather systems over the ocean, landing on British shores next weekend.  Becky Mitchell, Met Office meteorologist, said: The remnants of Storm Chris could move across the Atlantic and get caught up in different weather systems. Much of the week is going to be dry and fine, it will be a bit cooler. But towards the end of Sunday and into Monday we are likely to see more changeable weather on the way. Things will turn more unsettled, with more average conditions and some rain.   The UK is currently enjoying its 16th day of being 28C on average. And while the working week ahead and much of the weekend is likely to bring warm conditions, things will get cooler as we head towards next week. Sarah added: The weather we will be seeing after Chris is not particularly windy, but we could see rain moving in from the west.  The rain may be welcome by some given the weather we have experienced lately, but it won\u0027t be a total washout. Porthmadog in Wales is the current record holder for hottest temperature of the year, reaching 33C on June 28. But while more average condition are expected, the Met Office and Public Health England (PHE) upgraded their heatwave alerts for western regions of England on Thursday to amber and extended the current alerts through to the middle of next week. A yellow alert is in place for eastern regions. For those aged 65 and over, young children and those with heart and lung conditions can all find normal activities a strain when temperatures get this high. The hot weather has now been in place for two weeks and we are seeing an increase in the number of people who are attending GP surgeries and calling NHS 111 for heat related conditions such as sunburn, sunstroke, heatstroke and insect bites.

Harlow Langtree, two, is having aggressive chemotherapy to beat the disease which normally found in women over 50 who have been through the menopause .  She was diagnosed after doctors found a tumour on her left ovary. Stay-at-home-mum and housewife, Bianca Langtree, 27, from California, and her British husband, Mark, 32, from Dorset, were given the heartbreaking news in April 2016 after noticing Harlow was acting clingy and not eating. Bianca said: When you hear a doctor tell you your child has a fifty-fifty chance of surviving and would undergo a very rigorous and intense chemotherapy it\u0027s scary.  Initially Bianca and Mark thought Harlow had a bug or ear infection. But an x-ray showed a tumour had taken over Harlow\u0027s left ovary. When they showed us the x-ray of her tumour in her tiny body I wanted to throw up Bianca said. It felt like someone punched me in the stomach continuously until I couldn\u0027t breathe any longer. Harlow underwent major surgery to remove it and also had her appendix taken out as a precaution at the Children\u0027s Hospital of Orange County in California.  The experience has been traumatic for Harlow and her mum Bianca who was four months pregnant with daughter Sienna when Harlow was diagnosed. She said: Each time a nurse got close to Harlow she would cry. I think the first time I cried was after we left Harlow in the operating room to remove her tumour. I had been holding my emotions back for so long. Mark and I shared our first cry the night we came home after her surgery. Harlow had just been put in her crib. We cried watching her on the video monitor in her room. I remember us sharing \u0027how can a baby so precious be so sick?\u0027 \u0027this is so unfair\u0027 and \u0027I wish it was me and not her\u0027.  Despite their shock and worry, Bianca and Mark decided they should document every happy moment Harlow had and shared pictures on social media. We actually waited until after Harlow\u0027s first round of chemo to release the news to people other than immediate family and friends Bianca said. Once the initial shock was over, it was easier to answer any questions we knew would be asked. We wanted to share her highs and lows with anyone that wanted to follow her journey. Their tough journey has meant that they have lost friends along the way partly thanks to ignorant comments. A close friend of mine, at the time texted me and asked, \u0027is she going to make it?\u0027 What kind of friend even questions that? It was horrible, and it hurt Bianca said.  When Harlow had just finished treatment and had no hair, we often got people saying, \u0027you have such a cute boy\u0027 or \u0027look how cute he is\u0027. I know they weren\u0027t being mean in any way, but it is just sad she doesn\u0027t have long hair like a normal two-year-old should. You could tell it made them uncomfortable and we often found people couldn\u0027t turn away or would avoid looking in our direction when out in public. Thankfully Harlow was too young to notice any of this. The future is uncertain for Harlow but so far her rigorous fight against cancer is paying off. Bianca said: Harlow still has a long road ahead of her she is only in her first year of remission.

Jenna and Mike Coysh tied the knot in Devon on July 7 and were kind enough to screen England\u0027s quarter final match against Sweden during their wedding breakfast for guests to enjoy. But the game proved to be quite the distraction - especially at one particularly important moment.   As the happy pair stood to cut the cake, Harry Maguire scored the first goal for England, causing the wedding guests to go wild.  The hilarious moment was captured on camera by event videographer Tommy Rowe of Rowe Films in Exeter. A clip from the footage shows guests cheering as the ball goes into the net, before cutting to the bride and groom. And their reaction is brilliant  The pair seem oblivious to the interruption to their big day, and instead can be seen leaping around and grinning - with Mike still brandishing the large knife with which he was meant to cut the cake.  Speaking to DevonLive , Tommy said the moment was absolute gold.  He said: They managed to hook up a projector and the game was on during the wedding breakfast. It was swelteringly hot, but the atmosphere was just celebration all round.  The projector lost signal a couple of times and the lads ran over to fix it. Amazing stuff! England went on to beat Sweden 2-0, earning a place in the World Cup semi-finals.

The calving happened on June 22 and saw an iceberg a third of the length of Manhattan break off the glacier. The team of researchers and scientists at the site captured the event which caused other icebergs to separate with some flipping over entirely. Capturing the entire event on camera can help scientists examine how large icebergs may affect future sea levels. David Holland, a professor at NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics and NYU Abu Dhabi, who led the research team, said: Global sea-level rise is both undeniable and consequential.  By capturing how it unfolds, we can see, first-hand, its breath-taking significance, he added. The calving began at 11.30pm on June 22 when the four-mile-long iceberg started splintering off the Helheim Glacier. It took just 30 minutes for the iceberg to completely separate and the researchers condensed the event into a minute-and-a-half long clip. The clip shows the giant iceberg breaking off and then drifting into the sea. Denise Holland filmed the calving and said: Knowing how and in what ways icebergs calve is important for simulations because they ultimately determine global sea-level rise. The better we understand what’s going on means we can create more accurate simulations to help predict and plan for climate change. Experts at NYU have said it was a tabular iceberg, meaning it is wide and flat. As it breaks away from the glacier, other icebergs - known as pinnacle bergs meaning they\u0027re tall and thin - splinter off as well and flip over.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"community chest broughty ymca seeks cash to bring facilities up to 21st century standard","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry YMCA is hoping to land some of the cash in the Tele’s Community Chest.The group runs a community centre on Brook Street that aims to provide affordable services to everyone in the area.The centre hosts various activities ranging from ballet classes for youngsters to exercise classes for those aged 50-plus.It also has a community garden and men’s shed.There are just three weeks left to collect tokens in the Community Chest giveaway, which is your opportunity to get a share of £10,000 for your non-profit group or club.David Mills, one of the fundraising directors at the YMCA, said: “We are all excited about trying to collect as many tokens as we possibly can.Community Chest 2018“Any funds that we get go straight back into what we do on the front line.“Whatever we get from the competition is a bonus.”The YMCA’s current project involves renovating its Victorian gym and turning it into a state-of-the-art facility, which is where any cash it receives will go.David added: “The showers need brought up to 21st Century standards and then more people would be able to use them.”He said money would go towards equipment, toilet facilities and making sure the building is accessible to people in wheelchairs.He added: “We want to turn it into something we can be proud of.“We want people to come and use a facility that is beautiful on the outside but still in keeping with the heritage and, at the same time, that it is as good as we can make it.”For your chance to grab some cash, all you have to do is work as a team to collect as many of the tokens printed in the Evening  as possible from now until Saturday July 28.Don’t miss out on your chance to enter our Community Chest competition by visiting thetele/promotions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him. Although he’s out of the first-team picture right now, he remains highly regarded at Dens.Meanwhile, it was Waddell’s performances in the two Betfred derbies around this time last year that persuaded then Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon, now in charge of the ’Ton, to take him there.While Waddell gets to know his temporary new team-mates, the Dundee squad have settled in at their training camp in the Algarve.They were having double training sessions there today, before Saturday’s bounce game against Mansfield.A second game will follow against SC Farense on Tuesday night, before boss Neil McCann brings the squad back to Scotland next Wednesday.The focus out in Portugal is on making sure the team are ready to go from the first whistle when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group tie at Stirling Albion next week.For the second year running Neil is stressing the coming come ties are not being considered part of the pre-season build up.He insists the season proper starts with the Stirling game.“I always looked at it that way last year, I didn’t count the Betfred as a warm up to our season, the league season,” he said.“It’s a cup we want to go and do well in so in the pre-season games are vitally important we get the right conditioning into all the players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

2000 people attended seminars, talks and shared their ideas as part of the annual two-day gathering.Organisers were delighted to see the creativity spill out to the benches and gardens by the River Ness as industry leaders and those looking to progress their career exchanged ideas.The festival was staged in venues across the city but the majority of day sessions were held at Eden Court.Iain Hamilton, head of creative industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, said: \"Folk picked the seminars they needed to see and in between enjoyed meetings outside.\"There has been a really great turnout and most of the sessions have been very busy.\"He was also pleased to see Gaelic play such a big role in the festival line-up and applauded the translation services that opened the session up to everyone.\"The Gaelic media sector is unique and provides so many opportunities and it was great for visitors to the area to hear the seminar in Gaelic as well,\" he said.Most of the festival\u0027 emphasis was put on developing the creative industries for the future and this was highlighted with sessions such as Storytelling for 21st Century Audiences \u0026ndash with questions raised about the future of artificial intelligence and how, with using a formula, computers could one day produce stories.There was also a chance for people to enter the creative sector with sessions for those looking to get into television and music and an opportunity to mingle with leaders from across the industry.Mr Hamilton highlighted this as one of HIE\u0027 aims while planning the festival.\"It is giving access to industry leaders, showing what the trends are and what the future might be, it is also a chance for businesses to meet and see how they can work together,\" he said.\"On top of this it brings businesses to Inverness to see what we have on offer.\"The second day of the festival emphasised the importance of the creative sector and tourism industry working together to form events, films and productions that appeal to locals and tourists.The Highland Cool seminar showcased already established talent in the region such as Black Isle designer Siobhan Mackenzie and producer and songwriter Joe McAlinden.Mr Hamilton added: \"It shows that Highland businesses are at the same level \u0026ndash and can be as successful \u0026ndash as internationally based ones.\"Being based here does not hold you back.

There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of hard work\" remained.\"It is a hard task but I think if the public and private sector work together we can do that,\" he said. \"We need to maximise all the opportunities that there are and the Reinvent The City Centre campaign has highlighted that over many months.\"It is about making the city centre a really positive place to visit whether it is for the shops or socialising or meeting

store","story":"\u0026nbspTHOUSANDS of customers are being contacted following the sudden closure of an Inverness store specialising in mobility aids ranging from wheelchairs to stairlifts.Ableworld has cited an \"exploding\" glass panel and immigration hurdles for the American franchise owner as the reasons behind the closure of its Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) branch in Harbour Road.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Cheshire-based company, which is the UK\u0027 largest mobility retailer with more than 30 stores, is now making efforts to contact about 3000 customers, pledging no one will lose out on deposits or delivery of orders. It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 12:35

Any remaining cash will help pay the costs of the trip, which is expected to last for one to two weeks, depending on whether tendon lengthening is needed.Senga, 40, said: “It’s nerve-racking that now it’s so close. Obviously we’ve been trying to get this operation for her for so long. It’s just weird.”Senga said Olivia had been “fine” in the lead up to the operation, but predicted her daughter might have some pre-op jitters.Both Senga and husband Steven, 36, know that the surgery is not the end of the road for Olivia.Senga said: “As soon as the operation is finished, we know that’s just the start of it.“There’s still going to be lots of aftercare and physiotherapy to be done.”Both parents have been researching SDR for almost five years, and have been fundraising for 18 months.Senga wanted to pay tribute to the people who helped to raise money for Olivia, including her cousin Lewis, who completed a sponsored climb of Bennachie at the age of seven.She said: “It’s been really nice, people have just come to us and asked if they could do stuff to raise money.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square.

The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up).

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

welcome to this auspicious occasion, the opening of our new clubhouse.\u0026#8216We hope you agree with us that it’s a vast improvement on our previous clubhouse, built in the 1950s.\u0026#8216I would particularly like to welcome our special guest, Ailsa Stewart.\u0026#8216Mrs Stewart was asked to take over the running of the club 70 years ago in her present role as trustee.\u0026#8216Some have commented that this project has been all down to myself but that’s not true and I have a lot of people to thank.\u0026#8216Firstly, our committee, and this morning six of us set up for today.\u0026#8216Three members, Gill Wright, Jane Gallagher and Donald MacKay have been outstanding.\u0026#8216Gill designed the clubhouse and ramp and dealt with the planning regulations.\u0026#8216Jane, who unlike me, is very meticulous, reads the small print on our legal contracts with sportscotland and Tennis Scotland and advises us accordingly.\u0026#8216Gill and Jane have also raised funds this year with a quiz and raffle at various events culminating yesterday at the RNLI open day.\u0026#8216Donald, our captain, who is in California, on a number of occasions

the stress away from the rest of us who don’t have his expertise and knowledge.\u0026#8216Thanks to all of our sponsors listed on the new noticeboard inside the gate.\u0026#8216Thanks to all the contractors for their amazing work in transforming our club into one fit for the 21st century.\u0026#8216I would like to single out our main contractor, Gerry Nugent. Nothing was ever a problem. He was very reassuring even when we discovered the old clubhouse had no solid foundations.\u0026#8216I first became involved in the club as a 12-year-old looking to escape the house and meet up with friends.\u0026#8216My friends and I spent many hours at the courts, sometimes playing tennis, often not.\u0026#8216Mrs Dickson or Gertie, as we used to call her, was in charge in those days. She gave up so much of her time making sure the club was thriving and that we were behaving.\u0026#8216She had no hesitation in throwing us out if this wasn’t the case and I’m delighted to see Gertie’s sons, Toby and Ronnie here today.\u0026#8216Since 2014 we have raised a total of £95,000 to resurface our two courts and build the new clubhouse and ramp.\u0026#8216In two years I’ll retire from the committee and as a coach.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.  Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-named-ahead-of-dunbar-rnli-lifeboat-day","story":"  This year\u0026rsquos Lifeboat Queen is 14-year-old Beth Mackay, with attendants Mia Thomson, 11, and 12-year-old Anushka Demer.

Its launch triggered a start-up revolution as small firms from around the world were given a platform to easily get their software in front of millions of people.  Apple\u0026rsquos senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said the store had been a stand-out success for both Apple and app developers.  \u0026ldquoIn its first decade, the App Store has surpassed all of our wildest expectations \u0026mdash from the innovative apps that developers have dreamed up, to the way customers have made apps part of their daily lives \u0026mdash and this is just the beginning, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe could not be more proud of what developers have created and what the next 10 years have in store.  The launch of Apple\u0026rsquos App Store was followed by the release of the Android Market \u0026ndash later becoming the Google Play Store \u0026ndash in October 2008, providing a marketplace for the two most commonly used mobile operating systems.  As a result, present-day household names such as Instagram, Uber and Deliveroo have been able to build large-scale businesses that began with apps in these stores.  Apple also points to the launch of the App Store as the catalyst for the rise of mobile gaming and launching titles such as Angry Birds, Temple Run and Pokemon Go.  App developer Marco Arment said the creation of the App Store has helped software makers focus on their products rather than on how to distribute it.  \u0026ldquoSince day one, the App Store has been by far the easiest way for developers to reach the most people with our apps, he said.  \u0026ldquoIt eliminated the friction and overhead of setting up our own distribution and payment systems, making development far more accessible to everyone and letting us focus on our true passion: making the best apps we can.  \u0026ldquoOver its 10 years so far, the App Store has developed into the richest, most diverse, and most accessible software ecosystem the world has ever seen.  According to figures from app analytics firm App Annie, more than 130 billion US dollars has been spent on apps since 2010, with the store now available in 155 countries.

Although it is now less yomping youths and more budget family hotel, half of the 72 beds are still dedicated to shared dormitories for those who like the simple charm of communal living for which the hostels are famed.  As it nears its 9th decade, the organisation that runs the 34 Scottish hostels undertaken a name-change - from the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to Hostelling Scotland - which was executed this year.  Research showed that while older people used and still use or are rediscovering hostelling, younger people understood the concept less.  Glen Nevis is part of the resulting overhaul that includes developing gems like its hostel on the edge of Loch Ossian, renovation of Lochranza on Arran and could also include expansion with new properties including in St Andrews.  Wardens are also consigned to history, with managers there in their place and new apprenticeships are being developed to help bring in young staff.    Margo Paterson, Hostelling Scotland chief executive, said the evolution will continue as the organisation settles into its new identity.  She said: \"This major redevelopment project truly reflects our commitment to the modernisation of our accommodation network.  \"It also highlights our mission to make more of Scotland more accessible to more people than anyone else, and especially young people, providing great value, affordable, flexible and welcoming accommodation in the best locations across Scotland.\"  She said:\u0026nbsp\"We pride ourselves in excellent customer service, listening to our members and guests, understanding their needs and developing our network to offer the best possible hostelling experience.  \"The new Glen Nevis Youth Hostel, one of our flagship hostels, highlights this perfectly. We want guests to discover the real Scotland with us.\"  She said removing the word youth from their title did not reflect a move away from core customers and schemes to help groups of young people embark on rural adventures are also under way.  The \u0026pound6 membership and guest overnight income supports its charitable youth programmes and the maintenance of the hostelling network.  Following the strategic review of the organisation early in 2018, the 88-year-old hostelling association said: \"The new identity follows on from extensive marketing research and reflects the organisation\u0026rsquos commitment to understanding the needs of its members, guests and employees as the modern face of Scottish Hostelling.  \"The name also more clearly indicates its representation of Hostelling International within Scotland.\"  The 34 Hostelling Scotland hostels is about half of the number hostels from a decade ago, but it attracts 380,000 guests every year, with a turnover of \u0026pound9m and an estimated contribution to the Scottish visitor economy of \u0026pound25m.

There were Saltires hanging above the bar, and a raucous crowd that erupted in cheers when John Collins scored a penalty to level the game against the reigning champions.  The pub was in York the audience was largely English.  Growing up in northern England, it never occurred to me not to support Scotland, or any of the home nations. Why wouldn\u0026rsquot I?  Unless we were playing each other, of course.  I am a passionate England fan it was Italia \u0026rsquo90 that hooked me. I couldn\u0026rsquot watch the Egypt game live so I recorded it on VHS and watched it in full when I got home. I watched the Cameroon quarter final \u0026ndash the last time England won at that level before Saturday - on a black-and-white TV in my aunt\u0026rsquos farmhouse, and was allowed to stay up late to watch the West Germany semi-final on a tiny TV in my bedroom, before crying myself to sleep.

Then, perhaps unwisely for such a diehard England fan, I moved to Scotland.  England\u0026rsquos next tournament game was in Euro 2000, against Portugal. I watched it in a bar in Edinburgh and it was my first real experience of the Anyone But England (ABE) phenomenon.  When Portugal came back from 2-0 down to win the game, the cheers and cries of \"sunny Portugal, we\u0026rsquoll support you ever more\" were deafening.  For someone who grew up in England, yet always supported Scotland, it stunned me. I simply wasn\u0026rsquot prepared for the animosity. I was bitter and upset.  But that was then this is now. Nearly two decades on, I get it, and I revel in it. It\u0026rsquos a footballing rivalry and it\u0026rsquos a healthy one. I even felt comfortable enough to watch last year\u0026rsquos Scotland v England game in the home end at Hampden.  I watched England\u0026rsquos World Cup game against Panama in an Edinburgh bar. There were fans in England tops bellowing out \"It\u0026rsquos Coming Home\", while others cheered Panama\u0026rsquos consolation goal as if it had been scored by Leigh Griffiths himself. It was a cracking atmosphere, with no hint of tension.  Traditionally, of course, it\u0026rsquos the ABE crowd which has more fun. Like the time Frank Lampard\u0026rsquos goal against Germany was disallowed and we went on to lose 4-1. Or the time Portugal knocked us out on penalties. Correction: times, plural.  The pain of defeat has hurt over the years, but boy is this tournament is making up for it.  Every two years the same debate takes place: should Scots support the Auld Enemy?  There are those who insist Scots should back England, arguing that to do otherwise is embarrassing. I\u0026rsquom not one of them \u0026ndash it makes victory even sweeter for us.  There are those \u0026ndash mainly politicians \u0026ndash who pick another team for spurious reasons. The correct choice for politicians whose nation is not playing is that they\u0026rsquore not supporting anyone, precisely because their nation is not playing.  And there are those who watch every England game in the hope of a humiliating defeat for the Three Lions.  This contingent is smaller than in previous years, and some put that down to the humility of Gareth Southgate and his young squad. Yet perhaps a bigger reason is we now have a generation of Scotland fans who have never known qualification for a major tournament, making rooting for England\u0026rsquos opponents all the more futile.  In the binary world of post-indyref Scotland, where everyone is forced to be a Unionist or a Nationalist, it is inevitable that politics poisons the football debate.  In a newspaper column last week, the pro-independence columnist Lesley Riddoch wrote: \u0026ldquoAs Scotland finds its new place in the North Atlantic and the league of small, energy-rich European states, our age-old enmity with England will become utterly irrelevant.  Completely failing to understand that the enmity is to do with a footballing rivalry, not the constitution, does she actually think independence involves sawing along the border and allowing Scotland to float off in the direction of Iceland?  She added: \u0026ldquoOne day, football and the constitutional question in Scotland will be equally disconnected.  It always has been, Lesley, and it\u0026rsquos only fanatical nationalists who make it otherwise.  Among real fans, there is no link between constitutional preference and support or otherwise for England. Some of the most vociferous ABE backers I know are diehard Tories.  It is perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to be part of the UK and to want England to be crushed on the football pitch. It\u0026rsquos also perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to leave the UK and to want England to win on the football pitch.  Or any combination of the above: there are no strict rules.  You don\u0026rsquot get much more passionate about independence than the SNP\u0026rsquos former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, who tweeted this week: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely delighted for England, all English fans, friends and relations. Congratulations.  Oh how the SNP misses him in the Commons.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine Angus would have resorted to such petty antics as his successor Ian Blackford and colleagues did last week, when they repeatedly dawdled through the voting lobby and ensured English MPs and Commons staff missed the Colombia game.  A healthy rivalry should not involve sabotage. Just imagine if Scotland had qualified for the tournament and English MPs pulled the same stunt during a crunch match.  So it\u0026rsquos the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. Nearly three decades since the last time England reached this stage. Just like Gazza in Turin, it\u0026rsquoll probably end in tears.  But maybe, just maybe, Southgate\u0026rsquos men really are going to bring football home. After all those penalty defeats, all the failures of the \"golden generation\", all the crushed dreams, what absolute joy that will bring me \u0026ndash and what pain it will bring for so many Scotland fans.  I absolutely can\u0026rsquot wait."},{"url":null,"title":"melissa-george-tough-girl-who-told-weinstein-he-looked-ridiculous","story":"  You should try it, she says. I\u0026rsquom not sure I have the equipment, Melissa. Nor the nipple tassels.  Melissa George is an Australian actor who lives in Paris, who once upon a time appeared in Home And Away and these days works alongside Sean Penn and Gabriel Byrne. You will have seen her in films such as Mulholland Drive or The Amityville Horror or Derailed, or maybe on TV in Friends or Grey\u0026rsquos Anatomy.  She is funny, earthy (see above), outspoken (see below) and lives in France, where she is a single mother of two boys. It\u0026rsquos Friday afternoon, and she got off the plane from Paris only a couple of hours ago and here we are in the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, discussing the techniques of burlesque dancing.  The reason is her new film The Butterfly Tree, which is receiving its UK premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival a few hours after we speak. It\u0026rsquos an Australian movie about grief and desire and illness and flowers, roller skating and, yes, nipple tassels.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never seen a burlesque dancer with nipple tassels on roller skates and butterfly wings, George points out. Watch The Butterfly Tree and you will see George tackling all of the above. \u0026ldquoThis is not easy.  I know I made it look easy, but it\u0026rsquos not easy.  I think that we nailed it.  Making the film in Queensland, Australia, she says was one of the happiest experiences of her life. She travelled with her two sons, the youngest only a few months old.  \u0026ldquoI was obviously still feeding my son, she points out. \u0026ldquoNot many mothers after giving birth get to play a burlesque dancer with barely nothing on. I love stuff like that when you\u0026rsquore personally stretched and professionally stretched at the same time.  The film gives George a chance to channel her inner Blanche DuBois goes disco. She plays a former burlesque dancer turned florist who brings a little bit of sunshine into the life of a widower and his teenage son while hiding her own secrets.  It\u0026rsquos a movie about the male gaze made by a female director, Priscilla Cameron. George\u0026rsquos character Evelyn is a woman who has been looked at all her life. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos every reason for it in a way, George points out. \u0026ldquoWomen are beautiful. They are shaped beautifully.  Born in Perth, western Australia, in 1976, these days George\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoStrine has the faintest hint of a French flavour in the speaking. She seems very at home in Paris. Last night, she tells me, she had dinner with the French film director Leos (Holy Motors) Carax. \u0026ldquoWe meet once a week at the same restaurant. We have the same meal and just talk about updates of the week. I adore him.  \u0026ldquoBeing in Paris opens you to all sorts of places and people.  And yet, anyone with a passing interest in George will know that life in the French capital has not been easy of late. George has come through a bitter custody dispute over her two sons with her ex-partner Jean David, founder of AlloCine.  The couple now share custody, which is why George has to stay in Paris. What\u0026rsquos the shape of life in 2018, I ask her?  \u0026ldquoThe shape of life doesn\u0026rsquot have a shape. There\u0026rsquos no shape. What\u0026rsquos the shape for me?  I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, take a deep breath, look at my phone. Any fires to put out? No? Ooh, it\u0026rsquos going to be a good morning. Go for lunch, look at the phone again. Any fires to put out? Yes. Not such a good afternoon. It\u0026rsquos like that.  But George, who was previously married to the Chilean film director Claudio Dabed, says she is beginning to find her feet again. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a great feeling.  \u0026ldquoAnd, you know, if you want to treat yourself to life you go to Paris anyway, don\u0026rsquot you? I\u0026rsquom reminding myself of that every day.  Work is looking up, too. She recently shot a new TV series, The First, in New Orleans with Sean Penn and she\u0026rsquos still buzzing about it. \u0026ldquoI got to work with my idol and every day he gave me everything he had, absolutely everything he had.  It was on the set of The First, too, that she first started noticing the impact of the #MeToo movement. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore not so sexualised any more on set, she says. \u0026ldquoA lot of the male crew are a lot politer. Everything is kind of shifting and it\u0026rsquos also making women have a lot more respect for themselves too. Time\u0026rsquos for us now. We have to make the most of it and we have to step it up a little bit too.  We have to talk about Harvey Weinstein. The Hollywood producer who last month pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. Leading actresses, including Romola Garai and Kate Beckinsale, have accused Weinstein of arranging business meetings in hotels with them and turning up to find him dressed only in a bathrobe.  George made three films with Weinstein, including The Amityville Horror remake and Derailed. What she remembers is just how important he once was.  \u0026ldquoWhen I had meetings with Harvey Weinstein it was like \u0026lsquoOh my God if I don\u0026rsquot impress Harvey in this breakfast meeting I\u0026rsquom not going to get the movie.\u0026rsquo That\u0026rsquos how we used to think. Now it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoIf I\u0026rsquom not a great actress and a respectable woman and human being I\u0026rsquom not going to get the role\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoBut I remember being at the Peninsula [hotel] shaking because I was about to meet Harvey Weinstein.  \u0026ldquoI was an Australian tough girl and have seen Harvey so many times. He\u0026rsquos always been so respectful, always a gentleman always very kind because I give off the energy to him that I\u0026rsquom not going to accept anything otherwise.  That said, after one meeting she believes she was demoted from the lead female role in Derailed to that of the wife, with Jennifer Aniston drafted in to take the role she had originally.  Still, she says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never had anything but pleasant experiences with that man. But I know why. It\u0026rsquos because I showed him that\u0026rsquos the way it\u0026rsquos going to be.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no excuse for what he\u0026rsquos done and it\u0026rsquos no excuse for the way he manipulated certain women into doing certain things but in my case ... I just remember saying: \u0026lsquoyou look ridiculous with what you\u0026rsquore wearing.\u0026rsquo Suddenly the penny drops. Hold on, Melissa, sorry, I say, what he was wearing?  \u0026ldquoWell, we know what he wears.  A bathrobe? \u0026ldquoYes, so I remember saying: \u0026lsquoYou look ridiculous and I hope I leave the meeting with the lead in Amityville Horror\u0026rsquo.  This is Melissa George the tough Australian girl speaking. I am beginning to see how tough.  \u0026ldquoI had nothing but very good experiences with Harvey, she repeats. \u0026ldquoBut I know it\u0026rsquos got a lot to do with how I handled the situation. I\u0026rsquom not a #MeToo.  The Butterfly Tree is in cinemas from Friday."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8041789.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tribute-to-greatest-test-pilot-can-help-youngsters-dreams-take-off","story":"  Now Captain Eric \u0026ldquoWinkle Brown is to be honoured with the creation of a flying scholarship in his name for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Two years after he died at the age of 97, the most decorated pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) has been permanently honoured with a statue at Edinburgh Airport, his old base.  And there are additional plans for a more far-reaching memorial to the Leith-born aviator, with the scholarship being considered by a group of former pilots connected to his old university.    Eric Brown in a Wildcat, one of the 487 different types of aircraft he flew \u0026ndash a world record  The ex-pilots from the Edinburgh University Air Squadron Association (EUASA) got together to raise the funds for the life-sized bronze statue of Captain Brown, by Scottish sculptor David Annand.  Now Dr Hamish Macleod, chairman of EUASA, said the squadron also wants to put the scholarship in place to allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access light aircraft flying.  He said: \u0026ldquoWinkle was not only a man who loved to fly, but he also inspired a generation of pilots with his modest good humour and outstanding courage. The statue of him outside Edinburgh Airport will give the many thousands of passengers the opportunity to reflect on this Scottish hero who can inspire us all.  \u0026ldquoWinkle\u0026rsquos legacy can also bring a life-changing experience to today\u0026rsquos youngsters assisting them to learn to fly, or simply experiencing the thrill of flying in small aircraft.  The squadron raised \u0026pound50,000 for the statue and are bidding to raise a further \u0026pound50,000 to set up scholarships, with the estimated cost to achieve solo flying standard being \u0026pound3,000.  Captain Brown\u0026rsquos own flying experience started with a bumpy but exhilarating ride in his father\u0026rsquos First World War Royal Flying Corps bi-plane, which sowed the seed of ambition in an eager eight-year-old.  He learned to fly himself at the earliest opportunity he could after leaving Fettes College as a student at Edinburgh University, which was an RAF recruitment route.    Prince Andrew unveiled statue of Captain Eric Brown  During his early adventures, he saw Hitler\u0026rsquos oratory at the 1936 Berlin Olympics with his father and at one stage in his life managed to sing with the Glenn Miller band.  He became a British Royal Navy officer after training at RAF Turnhouse, now Edinburgh Airport, in the late 1930s and came to be affectionately called Winkle, short for periwinkle, by his friends because of his physical stature.  His most amazing achievements were in his role as a Royal Navy test pilot, during which he pioneered the perfecting of breakneck aircraft carrier deck landings.  Captain Brown holds the world record for flying the greatest number of different types of aircraft, a total of 487, which is a feat unlikely to be rivalled. The highly-decorated pilot also holds the world record for landings on aircraft carriers, at 2,407, and for take-offs on aircraft carriers, at 2,721.  Also in action, he used his language skills to interview Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, and was among those who liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.  He flew home a rocket-powered enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet, back to Britain from Germany after the aircraft was captured in 1945.    Sir John Elvidge, chairman of Edinburgh Airport, said: \u0026ldquoCaptain Eric \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo Brown is a someone who is synonymous with RAF Turnhouse and, in turn, a key figure in the history of what is now Edinburgh Airport.  \u0026ldquoHis achievements speak for themselves and the fact his remarkable career is still held in such high regard after all these years is testament to the man himself.  \u0026ldquoWe are proud of the connection between Edinburgh Airport and the RAF and we want people to share that by learning about this truly inspiring man who served his country with great honour, and this statue is a small token of thanks to him and his legacy.  The statue to honour Leith-born Captain Brown was unveiled at Edinburgh Airport by the Duke of York, who himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy for almost 20 years and now holds the rank of Vice Admiral.  The pilot has also received high praise from British astronaut Tim Peake who when he died tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station saying Capt Brown was \u0026ldquoto my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived.  First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said when Captain Brown died that he was one of the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos greats.  Paying tribute after his death, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best-known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater \u0026ndash the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation.  His family said in a statement released after his death: \u0026ldquoEric was the most decorated pilot of the Fleet Air Arm, in which service he was universally known as \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo on account of his diminutive stature.  \u0026ldquoHe also held three absolute Guinness World Records, including for the number of aircraft carrier deck landings and types of aeroplane flown."},{"url":null,"title":"island-vigil-for-alesha-macphail","story":"  Local people gathered to light candles for the six-year-old in Rothesay\u0026rsquos Guildford Square on Sunday evening.

Labour\u0026rsquos Keir Starmer said: \u0026ldquoDominic Raab\u0026rsquos appointment to the Brexit Department changes nothing.  \u0026ldquoThe deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this Government into crisis.  \u0026ldquoIt is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy, added the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  Explaining his resignation, Mr Davis warned the UK is giving \"too much away, too easily\" in the exit talks, but backed Mrs May to remain Prime Minister.  He said the Government had gone further than it should have in the negotiations, in a \"dangerous strategy\".  His decision to step down plunged Mrs May into a fresh leadership crisis and he was swiftly followed out of the Department for Exiting the EU by ally Steve Baker.

A Remain supporter, Mr Hunt has since converted to Brexit, and is seen as a potential replacement for Mrs May as Prime Minister.  His promotion means all four of the great offices of state - Prime Minister, Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary - are now occupied by Remain campaigners.  Mr Hunt praised Mr Johnson as \"one of the great driving forces in British politics\" and thanked him for his efforts after the Novichok nerve agent attack.  He said: \"My principal job at a time of massive importance for our country is to to stand four square behind the Prime Minister so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union that was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers.  \u0026ldquoThis is a time when the world is looking at us as a country, wondering what kind of country we\u0026rsquore going to be in a post-Brexit world.  \u0026ldquoWhat I want to say to them is that Britain is going to be a dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country, and we\u0026rsquore going to be a confident voice in the world.

As culture secretary he oversaw the 2012 London Olympics, although his most memorable moment was ringing a handbell on TV until it snapped and flew at a bystander.  His surname has also led to several unfortunate slips of the tongue by TV and radio presenters.  After the Olympics, he was moved to health, clocking up almost six years in post.  He was so attached to the job, he refused to move in Mrs May\u0026rsquos January reshuffle, and extracted a promise of extra funding to mark the 70th year of the NHS.

He made a fortune last year after selling an education business he set up, and in which he had a 48 per cent stake, for \u0026pound30m.  He also set up a property company with his wife which he failed to declare in his parliamentary register of interests on time and had to apologise earlier this year.  Multilingual, on paper he has more diplomatic skills than Boris Johnson, but was recently criticised for telling companies such as Airbus not to comment about Brexit.  He faces an intense first week on the job.  He is due to to join Mrs May at the Nato summit in Brussels on Wednesday, followed by President Donald Trump\u0027s visit to the UK on Thursday.

Georgina Lochrane, who also goes by the name Genie, took to a local Facebook group for locals on the Isle of Bute to reach out to them following her daughter\u0027s death.  The devastated mum said Alesha would be \"proud\" of what they had done for her and apologised for not being able to make the vigil the islanders organised Alesha on Sunday night.  The vigil attracted hundreds of mourners to Rothesay\u0027s Guildford Square, where mourners held candles and left tributes to the youngster.  It is the first time Genie has spoken out since her daughter was found dead in a woodland area near to her Grandmother\u0027s house.  Taking to the Isle of Bute Facebook page, Genie Lochrance wrote: \"I have finally built up the courage to write this. I would like to thank each and every single one of yous of the Isle of Bute for everything you\u0027s have done for mine and Robert\u0027s darling daughter.  \"She will be looking down with that big massive glowing smile of hers and be so proud for everything everyone has and will continue to do for her, myself, dad, grandparents and the rest of the people who loved our girl dearly.  \"I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Last night was beautiful. I am sorry I could not attend. Thank you once again.\"  Genie added in the comments: \"Thank you for your kind words. I will stand tall because this is what Alesha would want.  \"She always told me she would be strong like me when she got bigger and what a strong little girl she is. I have the full world behind me helping me be strong and fight. Thank you.\"  Locals and residents were quick to reply to the heartbreaking post.  Elaine Newlands wrote: \"Sending you lots of strength. Thinking of you all.\"  Catherine Gillies added: \"Thoughts and prayers with you Genie.\"  Nicole Booth wrote: \"As a mum myself I can\u0027t imagine what you must be going through just now. Every time I saw Alesha she was always a happy smiley little girl. I\u0027m so sorry she has been taken away from you.\"  Helen Dixon commented: \"Sending you all much love and hugs in abundance.\"  While Fiona Clark wrote: \"I cannot comprehend your pain. May there be some comfort in knowing the thoughts, wishes and love that there is for you and your little girl.\"  A 16-year-old boy has since appeared in court charged with Alesha\u0027s rape and murder.

The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances. All the ports were very competitive and attractive.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away. I stepped in to help with the shop.\u0026ldquoIt was proposed by the bank to sell up but my mother was determined to keep the family home and business and we all rallied round to make it a success.\u0026ldquoShe would do the book-keeping while also combining that role by milking five cows twice a day and ensuring the villagers had their milk.\u0026ldquoSadly she passed away in 1978 and it was at this point that I took over the shop.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove had some fine staff working alongside me \u0026ndash including Grant MacDonald who has been with me for all this time apart from three years he spent in the late sixties and early seventies working as the butcher on board the QE2 cruise ship.\u0026ldquoAlthough he\u0026rsquos the same age as me, Grant is carrying on as a butcher to assist my son Matthew who is taking over from me.Hugh also owned a grocer\u0026rsquos shop on Sinclair Street, which he purchased in 2001.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 12:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Tuesday 10 Jul 2018 12:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The Forth Marine Mammal Project will keep a record of marine life in the Firth. The project’s first base will be at Kinghorn, Fife, where enthusiasts flocked earlier this year for a sight of visiting humpbacks.            A series of whale-watching “kits” of binoculars and recording equipment, funded by an anonymous donor, will be installed on paths overlooking Kinghorn Beach and the project’s first 15 volunteers have already completed a training session.            The group behind the community scheme, Shorewatch, plans to establish further watching stations at Pittenweem, also in Fife, and at Granton, Edinburgh, and North Berwick on the southern side of the Firth.As well as the four humpback whales recorded in January and February, minke whales are seen regularly, and in the past there have been sperm whales and orcas.Project co-leader Sam Tedcastle said: “We don’t want to see sperm whales – if they come to the Forth it means there is something wrong. The humpbacks, we think, are coming here to feed which we think is a good sign, although it could indicate there is a problem with their food source elsewhere.“The more we find out the more questions arise and these are the questions we want to answer.”The Forth Marine Mammal Project boasts a diverse membership of amateur enthusiasts, including scientists, fishermen and photographers.            The Forth Shorewatch sites will add to already 18 in Scotland around the Moray Firth, west and north coast, the Outer Hebrides and AngusMs Tedcastle added: “The number of sightings we are getting on our Facebook page has demonstrated that there is a lot more marine life in the Forth than people thought. People have known for a long time that there are dolphins and whales come, but we hadn’t realised how frequently.“I don’t think there is much science being done in the Forth, and we wanted to do something more formal as well as having our page.“Hopefully we will record sightings over a few years and be able to establish patterns in the whale and dolphin populations.”            The  Forth Marine Mammal Project has already helped reveal that one of the humpbacks that has already visited the Firth of Forth twice in two years is now in Iceland.Lyndsay McNeill, a member of the project, spent months poring over hundreds of \u2028photographs and videos to \u2028find the humpback, nicknamed “Sonny”, which returned to the estuary in January a year after first being sighted there."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765906.1531125482!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith brexit no longer means brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment brexit s true impact on our national health service","story":"        DURING 2016\u0026#8217s referendum on EU membership, those arguing most passionately in favour of a Leave vote were adamant that one of the main beneficiaries would be the National Health Service.                Without the need to pay for membership of the European club, went the argument, the UK could invest £350million-a-week in the NHS. Campaigners making this entirely dubious claim went so far as to emblazon it on the side of a bus, a cynical but effective move that helped perpetuate what The Scotsman regards as the myth that membership of the EU represented a drag on the UK economy.            The truth is that Brexit is set to have major impact on the health service but not in the positive way Leavers insisted.            It will not have escaped the attention of anyone who has used the NHS in recent years that it depends for the maintenance of acceptable standards upon the services of a great many staff who are not UK citizens.Uncertainty over the status of these staff post Brexit should be a matter of the gravest concern for us all.Gung-ho hardline Brexiteers may argue that the UK should walk away from the EU without any kind of deal. We believe this to be a dangerously reckless approach.A new report makes clear that a no-deal Brexit would impact on staffing not to just in hospitals but beyond.The social care sector - providing nursing and support services to the elderly and disabled in their own homes - currently employs 10,000 EU nationals in Scotland.            These staff are now living under a dark cloud of uncertainty while Eurosceptics across the political spectrum flex their muscles and demand that the “will of the people” be satisfied, no matter what.We do not believe it was the will of those people who voted Leave to bring the health and social care sectors to their knees.Prime Minister Theresa May has, in recent days, begun to show a little more steel in her dealings with the Eurosceptics in her party. While she is in this frame of mind, we hope she will take the necessary step of making clear that, whatever form Brexit takes, health and care workers who have devoted themselves to building careers here will be welcome to remain and that she will not prevent employers from bringing in more workers if necessary."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765145.1531123829!/image/image.jpg","title":"nick freer comment thinking outside the box to attract digital talent","story":"        I wrote last week about one of this country\u0026#8217s top venture capitalists and his view that in order to succeed in all things tech, we need an increasing pool of local digital and IT talent together with more senior managers experienced in global growth.                This stacks up with ScotlandIS’s annual survey which found that the local marketplace is anticipated to provide the bulk of new people talent, with 70 per cent of respondent companies expecting to recruit from within Scotland in 2018. No huge surprises here and a more interesting finding was around a marked increase in company demand for modern apprentices, with almost half of respondents saying they would recruit in this way.              Peter Proud, CEO and founder of Cortex Worldwide whose cloud-based technology platform includes Microsoft as a key client, says the group’s graduate apprenticeship scheme is “the second best thing we’ve done after founding the company.” Proud praises the work of ecosystem players like Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and Edinburgh Napier University to support further learning and employers, the overall engagement of the Scottish Government and says that the performance of Cortex’s graduate apprentices have “at least matched, in some cases exceeded” that of traditional university graduates. Cortex’s CEO, who will shortly take up a board position with ScotlandIS, also says his team is actively looking to hire from digital skills academy CodeClan over the next few weeks.              CodeClan deserves a special mention here, with around 600 people set to have graduated from its 16-week Professional Software Development Course by the end of the year. Key to CodeClan’s long-term success will be expanding the network of commercial and public sector employers who take on its graduates. George Elliott, Craneware’s chairman and a former Wolfson Microelectronics finance chief, reminded me last week not to forget about other skill sets: “It’s not just digital skills that we need but also commercial skills and knowledge of how to scale, market and sell the technology.” Elliott, whose track record of selling into the North American market during his time at Wolfson is nothing short of legendary, says we are better at this in Scotland than we were but we have to do more to compete effectively.   The CEO of one of Scotland’s most highly rated scale-ups, John Peebles of Administrate, says there is “a massive skills gap within the industry for people who are not engineers but have worked at large, scaling global tech start-ups. The skills shortage will become an acute choke point for the local tech industry within the next three years as local start-ups begin to mature.”Kelli Buchan, a highly rated technology recruitment specialist who has helped to build teams for fast-growth companies like Adminisrate, FanDuel, snap40 and pureLiFi, says: “Without a doubt Scotland, especially Edinburgh, has a thriving tech scene.“The opportunities in the digital sector are excellent and varied, for those who live here or those who move to work here. However, the biggest challenge in this sector is the fact that the competition between employers looking for talent is huge.            “There are simply not enough great candidates to fill the open roles which exist, especially in the start-up scene. From my experience with startups, recruitment is one of the last things they think about as they are so focused on building a product and securing funding.“When both are achieved, they then need to hire fast and the talent is so hard to find. The advice I always give to CEOs is to think and have your hiring plan in place at the very beginning so you do not lose out to competitors.”Susanne Mitschke, CEO and founder of MindMate, which develops apps to manage dementia from a headquarters in Glasgow with an investor base of US VCs, thinks Scotland has a very good standing when it comes to digital talent. Mitschke says: “We use the University of Glasgow’s recruitment system to find graduates and the quality has been fantastic. I see many other companies, in places like London, Berlin and the US who have trouble finding software developers, particularly affordable ones.”    In big news in Scotland’s informatics circles, David Richardson, currently director of partnerships at the University of Edinburgh’s soon to be opened Bayes Centre, is set to move to Heriot-Watt later this year to take up the position of chief entrepreneurial executive at the university’s new Discovery and Innovation Centre. Richardson says: “We have fantastic initiatives in Scotland focused on addressing the digital skills gap. Data science and cyber security are two of the hot areas right now and we need to continually work across industry, government and academia to help people upskill and retrain for the future.”             Overall, Richardson thinks Scotland’s report card reads well but says we could be doing more at primary and secondary level in order to start the “digital journey” even earlier.- Nick Freer is a founding director at the Freer Consultancy and Full Circle Partners"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nTuesday 10 Jul 2018 12:39

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
