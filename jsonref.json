The UK government’s advice to “stay alert” in order to “control the virus” therefore implied that it would be easier to spot an invisible microbe if one were standing on a hill. Perhaps the underlying motivation for this much-ridiculed slogan was that it set the rhetorical scene for future spikes in deaths to be blamed on the people themselves. Did you die of Covid-19? Too bad: you weren’t alert enough. Survival of the fittest, and all that.If you can’t actually do something, it might help to claim that you have the “capacity” to do it at some undefined point in the future. Capacity strictly means the ability to take in a certain quantity of things (so, the capacity of a theatre or a vessel), but its modern business (and so political) use speaks rather to the potential ability to put out a certain quantity of things, whether widgets or Covid-19 tests. In this way one can boast of increasing one’s “capacity” for crucial work even as the quantity of work isn’t increasing. The great Thomas de Quincey once wrote: “Men of genius have a larger capacity of happiness”, which might explain why Boris Johnson is looking so glum and irritable these days.The UK government promised workers that their workplaces would be made “covid-secure” so that it would be safe to return, as all are now expected to do by August. This, however, is bilge, at least if “secure” means “protected from or not exposed to danger certain to remain safe and unthreatened” (OED): in that sense, the only way to make an office covid-secure is to hermetically seal it from the outside world and allow no one in. Perhaps this piece of paramilitary rhetoric is really aimed at warding off lawsuits under the Health and Safety at Work Act, which requires places of employment to be “safe”. If the government has said they are “secure”, how could they be unsafe?Only a cynic would suppose that when the rules were introduced mandating “face coverings” on public transport, the government was trying hard not to be seen contradicting earlier advice that public mask-wearing was unnecessary. (The motivation for that advice was almost certainly to preserve limited supplies of masks for health workers.) The potentially sinister aspect of masks is coded into its etymology: probably from the post-classical Latin “masca” meaning evil spirit or ghost. Now bloviating defenders of libertarian freedom call masks “muzzles”, perhaps because they are nervous about their own bigotry no longer being clearly audible through a cloth barrier, and some have even complained about “mask Nazis”, which inflammatory rhetoric would in more ordinary times be a good reason to cover one’s face in shame.Early on in the pandemic, the government announced that new antibody tests would be a “game-changer”, before it turned out that the millions of such tests it had ordered were useless luckily, a potential method of treating the virus with interferon-B has now been hailed as another “game-changer”. According to the OED, the term “game-changer” was first applied, in 1962, to a single man: the American football player Bob Sheflo. Since then, a “game-changer” has been anything that thoroughly disrupts the current way of thinking or doing things, as well as anything that does nothing of the sort except in the hopeful minds of marketers. Whether it has been appropriate throughout the pandemic to imply that the response was merely a “game” is a nice question.In classical Latin, a “hero” is someone with unheard-of strength or other abilities, favoured by the gods or actually semi-ine. The word arrives in English in retellings of such mythologies, and then also comes to be applied to soldiers who exhibit particular bravery, or civilians of notable excellence. Only in the modern age do whole categories of employment contain “heroes”, especially in US English, where it applies to every member of the armed forces and, for a while after 911, to police and firefighters. During the pandemic, all doctors and nurses also became “heroes”, which is a pleasant tribute that costs the speaker little, though it is understandable if many healthcare professionals found it irritating. After all, heroes don’t need our help, and if they die that is even more heroic.Perhaps one good thing to come out of this time will be a reluctance to continue using “viral” as a term of admiration, as in viral tweet or viral marketing. On the other hand, there might be an increasing medicalisation of political rhetoric, as with the revival of the scary term “infodemic”, used by the WHO in the spring to describe a deluge of misinformation about Covid-19. It was coined in 2003 by the American writer David J Rothkopf to describe the falsehoods then circulating about the Sars outbreak, but did not then manage to become endemic in popular speech, as it now might. At first glance the portmanteau word looks like nonsense etymologically, since the “-demic” part of pandemic means simply “the people” or “peoples”, but perhaps it carries a dark implication that allowing everyone to act as spreaders of information on Twitter, Facebook and the like, has at best had mixed consequences.The “nouvelle vague” in French originally described the emerging youth culture of the late 1950s, and was then applied to the cinema of Roger Vadim, François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. The phrase passed into English in 1960s as “new wave”, and was enthusiastically applied thereafter to various novel clusters of cultural production, particularly in 1970s rock and punk music. A “new wave” (or “second wave”) of Covid-19 infections, if the R (qv) goes up over 1 again, by contrast, will not feel so hip. But the oceanic metaphors for the pandemic (waves, surges) don’t help either, as they instil a sense of inevitability and helplessness while erasing agency. A wave or surge of water is an impersonal natural phenomenon, but a wave or surge of illness might be the consequence of a political decision.The black humour of referring to Covid-19 as “the plague” was a cathartic example of dysphemism: the opposite of euphemism, describing something as worse than it really is. The word comes from the Latin “plaga” meaning “wound” and later “illness”, and in time was applied to any pestilential thing or person. The cliche “to avoid something like the plague” is first recorded in a form written by the 17th-century Quaker leader William Penn, who founded the province of Pennsylvania. “An able bad man,” he wrote, “is an ill Instrument, and to be shunn’d as the Plague.” We should give thanks, then, that we have only incompetent bad men leading us.In epidemiology, R0 is the “basic reproduction rate” of a disease, where “R” is the number of other people a carrier will on average infect, and “0” indicates that no one in the population is immune. As an epidemic wears on, some will become immune, so it makes more sense to use the “effective reproduction number” – Re, or just R – which assumes an only partially susceptible population. Oddly, while numbers such as pi or unknown variables such as x don’t usually take a definite article in speech, it seems impossible to talk simply of “R” rather than “the R”, or (tautologously) “the R number” or “the R value” or “the R rate”. This might be easier to pronounce fluently, but it unhelpfully implies that R is a single monolithic number applying to the whole country, whereas in fact it varies by region, as the citizens of Leicester have uncomfortably discovered.People with compromised immunity and other conditions were from early on advised to “shield”, and were referred to as “shielding”, an unusual intransitive use of the verb that normally requires a shielder and a shieldee. Among the earliest metaphorical uses of the verb in English are references to God as the one who shields (protects or shelters) a faithful person, but in a modern secular age it seems one can count only on oneself. The very old Germanic word “shield” originated as the term for an armoured plate carried in a soldier’s hand, and so the pandemic usage was another example of the foolish governing metaphor of pandemic responses as warfare.When used with a definite article, “the science” can often mean “the particular scientific viewpoints that I find convenient”. Thus the UK government’s claim always to have “followed the science” in its pandemic response, despite disagreement from many other scientists. Unfortunately, while it is appropriate to speak of “the science” with regard to settled matters such as the theories of gravity that enable spaceflight, it is misleading while there remain many unanswered questions about a pathogen that was discovered only at the end of last year, and it was especially obfuscatory when there were profound disagreements between different disciplines – behavioural science, mathematical modelling, virology – jostling early on to count as “the science” on the pandemic.In the early days, news reports noted that those dying from Covid-19 had “underlying health conditions”: this vertical metaphor, as though the coronavirus sat atop a host of other problems, implied that the “underlying” conditions were the more profound and causally relevant. This in turn gave succour to a strand of performatively tough-minded opinion that argued such victims had it coming anyway, and it was unfair to stop the rest of us going to castles. By coincidence, the Minneapolis police department initially claimed that George Floyd, too, had “underlying health conditions”, implying that it was these, and not being choked to death by a policeman’s knee, that actually killed him. It is perhaps as well to note that we all have the underlying condition of being mortal, and one day we will all have died of something anyway.Boris Johnson, in his usual mode of jaw-waggling bullshit, announced that the UK would have a “world-beating” test-and-trace system by early June. It did not, though some morbid jokers pointed out that the UK was at least “world-beating” in having one of the highest numbers of deaths per capita from Covid-19 of any country. But the prime minister’s vacuous promise betrayed a more profound poverty in outlook. Why, after all, do we have to beat the world? Why would we so fervently wish that more people die in other countries than in ours? The very use of “world-beating” in such a context betrays a merciless vision of the planet as a zone of bloody zero-sum competition. It is perhaps not surprising to find such an outlook in a juvenile solipsist, but the rest of us might feel that it’s past time for political rhetoric to grow up a little.As a verb, “to zoom” means to move very quickly, particularly while making a humming or buzzing sound. In this form it was coined onomatopoeically in the 19th century, but it now has a new meaning owed to the videoconferencing corporation of that name, founded in 2011 but unknown to most till recently: shall I Zoom you? Can we Zoom? As an exclamation, says the OED, “zoom!” “frequently used to express a sudden swift movement or (figurative) a rapid change, as a sudden rise or fall in fortunes”, which is after all quite appropriate for these times, as well as for Zoom’s own stock price, which has roughly tripled during the pandemic. It has also recently announced that people who use it for free will not benefit from encryption to prevent others from snooping, which might remind us of another meaning of “zoom”: to scope out or spy on. As Aretha Franklin once asked, who’s zooming who?• Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36e74786f9455273e5d9d3269531a5fb0b78eab4/0_1207_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b10df8cd512c98707199296905e97e91","title":"ottessa moshfegh americans are really good storytellers and really good liars","story":"Famous for writing about isolation, the author of My Year of Rest and Relaxation talks about her new novel, chronic pain and growing up as the child of migrants in America“It is just kind of a coincidence, obviously,” Ottessa Moshfegh says of the importance of isolation in her fiction, from her home in Pasadena, California. “But yeah, it has been a major theme in my life.” She was due to be in the UK this summer as part of a publicity tour for her third novel, Death in Her Hands, but she had an odd sense “that something was going to get fucked up”. Clearly, she didn’t foresee a global pandemic, but her 2018 cult novel My Year of Rest and Relaxation, in which her unnamed narrator holes up in her New York apartment, has made her the unofficial laureate of lockdown. “I guess it makes me glad that people are having a place to put their isolated misery,” she says of the novel’s resurgence in recent months.Routinely hailed as one of the most exciting young American authors working today, she has been compared to Flannery O’Connor, Shirley Jackson and Charles Bukowski (one of her heroes). Her characters are a miserable ensemble of drunks and dropouts, misfits and murderers, pervs and pill-heads – all loners. And she has created an inimitable band of angry, sometimes amoral, often unpleasant and always unreliable narrators, who challenge our assumptions about femininity in uncomfortable ways. Her work takes dirty realism and makes it filthier. But it is is also beautiful: “like seeing Kate Moss take a shit”, as she memorably described her writing the depravity of her material matched by the purity and precision of her prose (a sort of American Edward St Aubyn, minus the aristos). Just don’t call her a millennial writer, “even though I am millennial”, says the author, who turns 40 next year. “There’s nothing flattering at all about the description right now.”It is barely 8am Pacific time when we talk on Skype. The house where she lives with her husband, the novelist Luke Goebel, and their two dogs was built by an artist in the 1920s and is called “Casa de Pájaros” she tells me, as if I were actually visiting, “which means house of birds”. As you’d expect from her fiction, she is intensely serious, given to flashes of dry wit: “It’s too late”, she deadpans, when I say we need warning of what she’s writing next (“a novel which begins in China and comes to America”, she adds grimly). Careful in her replies, she sometimes pauses so long that I worry the screen has frozen.The pandemic has provoked “a kind of war-like situation” in the US, she says. But the rise of Black Lives Matter and the recent Native American protests against Trump’s speech at Mount Rushmore have given her hope, despite “everything else that is coming to the surface, which is so rotten and so overdue in its exposure”. Americans are “really good storytellers and really good liars”, she says, especially about their country’s history. “It’s over! Enough of us have woken up … have disabused ourselves of a fantasy that everything is OK here because our own lives are fine.” Of course “things can always get worse”, she says, especially “if Trump is re-elected. You can’t underestimate the incredible power of stupidity.”Famous for writing about isolation, Moshfegh is herself no stranger to spending long periods in monk-like retreat from the world. A couple of weeks into California’s lockdown, she knew that the only way she “would survive this period creatively” was to work: “How else do you survive this feeling of endlessness?”This question goes to the heart of all Moshfegh’s fiction, from her 2014 novella McGlue, a feverish monologue by a drunken 19th-century sailor accused of murdering his wealthy gay lover to her first novel Eileen, shortlisted for the Man Booker prize in 2016, in which poor Eileen, living with her abusive alcoholic father, is as trapped as the boys in the prison where she works. It is most obvious in My Year of Rest and Relaxation, which is set at the turn of the millennium and builds inexorably to 911. The narrator withdraws from the world, sustained only by Whoopi Goldberg movies and a panoply of pills, in the belief that if she can only sleep enough she will “become a whole new person”. “As summer dwindled, my sleep got thin and empty, like a room with white walls and tepid air conditioning.”All of Moshfegh’s characters are in some sort of solitary confinement, self-imposed or otherwise: “Isolation is the natural condition that we need in order to be introspective, to go on a journey with ourselves towards some new thing,” she says. Seventy two-year-old Vesta, the narrator of Death in Her Hands, is no exception: following the death of her controlling husband, she has moved to a remote cabin in rural Levant to live out her last years in peace, with only her beloved dog for company. “I had no need for a phone. I had nobody to call and nobody would ever call me.”Moshfegh calls Death in Her Hands “a loneliness story”, lonelier even than its predecessors, which seems a bit like distinguishing between shades of jet black. She wrote the first draft back in 2015, at “an extremely lonely point” in her life. Her “tendency as a novelist”, she explains, is to bring a story to a certain point “then to leave it alone so that I can go off and learn everything that I need to learn from my life and writing experience so that when I come back to it, I’m a smarter writer with better ideas. It’s just my instinct.” She had just finished her blistering collection of stories, Homesick for Another World: “It was almost like someone had died when I finished that book,” she told the New York Times recently. “I was in so much emotional pain and confusion that I needed a project that was going to keep me in the present moment,” she says now. “This book was born out of a need to give myself another world to live in that was safe.”Safe seems an odd description for a novel that opens, ostensibly at least, with a murder, when Vesta discovers a note while out walking her dog: “Her name was Magda. Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn’t me. Here is her dead body.” Although Death in Her Hands is “probably even more literary than McGlue”, she is prepared for it “to be mistaken for a mystery novel”. She still regrets comments in an interview for this paper in 2016, saying that Eileen had started as a “fuck-you joke”, written in two months following a how-to-write formula to help her break into the publishing mainstream. (In interviews, her openness and unapologetic self-assurance can seem almost shocking.) Like Eileen, Death in Her Hands uses the conventions of crime fiction to explore the writing process itself, as Vesta’s wild imaginings about Magda’s fate turn her into a detective-novelist figure. “It is about how a character can construct a story with almost nothing to go on,” she says. “How do you solve a mystery in your mind? That’s basically what writing a novel is.”The other clue to the novel is in the title – death. “There’s a lot to write about death,” she says wryly. “That was the thing that was waiting for me.” In 2017 she endured “a year of death after death in horrible and shocking ways”. In May, Jean Stein, part of American publishing aristocracy killed herself by jumping from the 13th floor of her Manhattan apartment. Moshfegh had worked as her assistant in her 20s, and found her death a horrifying echo of the falling woman at the end of My Year of Rest and Relaxation. “I loved her deeply,” she says. “She was like a godmother to me.” Then in November her younger brother Darius died from an overdose. “My brother’s death completely changed my life,” she says. He was 30.Death had been lurking in her consciousness ever since she was five years old, when, as she tells it in an unmissable fictional letter to President Trump, “a black hole” opened before her feet. “I heard a voice echo up from the hole and say to me with complete authority: ‘You will die one day.’ ‘Well, shit, I thought.’” For a long time she felt she knew when that day would be, but now she’s not so sure. “I think maybe my destiny shifted or something,” she says, which may sound like so much Californian hokum. But that experience at kindergarten was her first realisation that she is “not like other people. I am just pretending to operate in the more mundane quotidian world for much of the time,” she says. “In my heart and soul I’m mostly in that other place.”As a child she was “very well-behaved”, she says. “Very quiet and very, very observant.” But she was always bothered by the same question: “Why did I feel like such a weirdo?” The answer she has arrived at is a knotty combination of her unusual ancestry and upbringing. The middle child of an Iranian father and Croatian mother, both professional violinists (they met at the Royal Conservatory in Brussels) who fled Tehran at the outbreak of the Iranian revolution, she was always “acutely aware” of her troubled heritage, in a way that had “zero place” in the suburban America of the 1980s. “It was a lot to take on as a child, growing up in a country whose culture your parents don’t know,” she says, “and they were still recovering from all of the shit that happened to them, which was horrifying and unexpected, and everything that happened to their parents.”Their house in the leafy town of Newton , just outside Boston, Massachusetts, was always a mess, she says, with violins and books everywhere. Everything was “secondary” to music: her elder sister Sarvanez was “a prodigy cellist”. Ottessa learned to read music before words, and could play four instruments by the time she was seven. “Music is so mysterious in the way that it affects us,” she says. “It is this sort of intangible resonance that gets inside our body and affects our emotions, and I think of words in the same way.” Her supreme self-discipline and confidence stem, perhaps, from such an intense, competitive environment. She “discovered she was a writer” at 14, when her mother sent her on a creative writing summer camp (they had missed the deadline for the music programme): “I accepted my destiny.”Between the ages of nine and 12, Moshfegh had to wear a brace for severe scoliosis of the spine for 23 hours each day, which is hard not to read as an embodiment of the themes of pain and entrapment that shape her fiction. “That brace fucked me up in many, many ways,” she says. “I am still fucked up.” It was prescribed for her “to try to control and constrict my growth, because I was growing in the wrong directions,” she says. Pain is still something she “deals with 24 hours a day” ironically for the author of My Year of Rest and Relaxation, she now writes mainly in bed “with a very specific pillow situation”. In 2007 she contracted a nasty case of cat-scratch fever, which made her feel as if she “was going totally nuts” and forced her to leave New York to return home to be looked after by her mother for a while.Dealing with the body, and physical appearance, are fraught issues in Moshfegh’s novels, which subvert any objectification of women (you won’t find an author photo on any of her books). Her own struggles with an eating disorder (“an enormous element of my relationship with myself and my life”), and alcohol – she was in AA for much of her 20s – recur like aftershocks throughout her work: drunken McGlue, laxative-guzzling Eileen, bulimic Reva in My Year. “My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nun’s lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings,” begins “Bettering Myself” the first short story in Homesick for Another World. In Death in Her Hands, Vesta lovingly feeds her dog a whole chicken while making a bagel last all day for herself her disgust at the local women, “dull heifers … with nothing to do but eat”, a response to her self-starvation. “Drink wine” is on her to-do list. “It’s up to you whether you think she’s likable or not,” she says sharply. “She’s supposed to be human.”Today Moshfegh’s only addiction is to work, which has at times also threatened to consume her at one point she renounced romance to concentrate on writing. Until, in a story that has become part of Moshfegh legend, Goebel appeared at her door one day to interview her, just as a Vedic astrologer had predicted he would. “I saw him with his dog, and my precise thought was ‘Oh, shit – here it is.’ Then I kind of surrendered,” she wrote. The interview lasted a month, and ends: “Yup, and I love you.”The novel she is working on at the moment (having put the China one on hold – “It hasn’t felt like the right time to work on it”) is set in an eastern European village during the middle ages, and has come really fast. “It is giving me a place to put all the things that I don’t necessarily understand about humanity and why we do the things that we do to each other,” she says. To “unfix” her mind she watches things on YouTube, in particular police interrogation confessions. “There’s something about watching someone get worn down into telling the truth, at least in this project, that is kind of helpful,” she explains. “Helpful but also sort of entertaining and horrifying.” (At a particularly low point in her early 20s, while teaching in the Chinese city of Wuhan, she got into “the habit” of googling images of dead people.)After years on the move, she is finally settled with Goebel in Pasadena. “I kinda wanted to move to the suburbs,” she says, when they tired of travelling between her apartment in East Hollywood and his place in the desert. Her dog Walter (also the name she gave Vesta’s creepy dead husband) joins her on Skype after his nap. “Stability only makes me smarter,” she says. “Because I don’t have to waste energy trying to stabilise.” Lockdown or not, she still spends her time “constantly writing”, or thinking about writing. “All of the pain and suffering and frustration and insanity that results in writing a novel, all of that difficulty is what I’ve chosen,” she says. “I do it because I love it.”• Death in Her Hands is published  by Jonathan Cape (£14.99).

You can’t get a toilet for love nor money.”There has been soaring demand for pitches at campsites as people have had overseas breaks cancelled or just opted to holiday closer to home this year.However, concerns over hygiene during the pandemic mean some sites have reopened without their usual facilities – almost a third of the Camping and Caravanning Club’s 103 sites currently have no toilets or showers open to customers.At the same time, more holidaymakers are opting to make their own arrangements in lieu of using shared blocks, leading to a run on toilets and cubicle tents to accommodate them.The options for campers range from basic toilets akin to a bucket with a seat, selling from about £15, to more upmarket versions, some complete with flush, typically £50 and upwards.Anyone staying in a tent rather than a caravan with a separate bathroom may also want to invest in a separate toilet tent – these start at about £25 but it is possible to spend as much as £160 if you’re feeling flush.Attwoolls’ website currently lists all but one product as sold out, while at World of Camping all types are unavailable. Argos is showing toilets and tents as in stock but none appear to be available for delivery.Dave Addy, a buyer for the UK’s largest outdoors retailer, Go Outdoors, said it had seen a “huge rise” in sales of toilets, toilet chemicals, camping showers and utilityshower tents, and that “many of these items sell out as soon as they arrive in stock”.He said this was driven by “those seeking a true socially-distanced and self-contained camping setup”.Supply has also been a problem, with delayed deliveries from manufacturers in east Asia.It’s the same story at Newquay Camping and Leisure in Cornwall. It said it was struggling to get products from suppliers who had been taken by surprise by the move towards more UK holidays.Suppliers confirmed that demand for their products was much higher than in bog-standard years.Kampa, which makes toilets and tents, said sales had been “very good” while Thetford, a firm that has made its Porta Potti portable toilet for more than 50 years, said demand for all of its products was “significantly higher”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a87f7bd4ce8e947f726a122d72d59c270f2cc8/454_643_5114_3069/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e779cc21af3f678eb581cffa6820714","title":"ftse 100 rises economic covid unemployment","story":"Surge in shares contrasts with Covid-related downturn and growing unemploymentThe economic collapse in Britain during the second quarter of 2020 was the most brutal on record. Unemployment is forecast by the Bank of England to soar to 2.5m by Christmas. The Brexit cliff edge approaches. Yet in the City, the FTSE 100 has been on the up.Three out of the four biggest companies in the FTSE 100 were this week trading at share prices above their levels at the start of 2020, as if the pandemic never happened.Unilever, maker of consumer goods from Domestos to Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ice cream, was trading at about £45 a share this week, compared with £43 in January. Drug giant AstraZeneca (boosted by vaccine hopes) is fetching £85 a share from £68 in January, and even mining conglomerate BHP (largely Australian, but listed in London) is a smidgen above its January price.The FTSE 100 is yet to fully recover to the 7,500 level it enjoyed before the lockdown, but the steep market fall in February and March – when it dropped below 5,000 – is now a distant memory. Some pension funds, such as the Nest scheme which covers 9 million “auto-enrolled” workers, are back to where they were before the pandemic.Nest’s default pension fund currently has a unit price of 207p, compared with 208p at the start of January.UBS, which styles itself as the world’s “leading wealth manager” with $2.3tn under management, thinks UK shares, and sterling, will go even higher. Its economist Dean Turner said the worst of the slump in the economy is over, there is a strong bounce-back in activity, and pent-up consumer demand will power a strong recovery later in the summer and into autumn.“In our view, UK assets look undervalued. In this environment, we continue to maintain a preference for UK equities relative to other eurozone stocks, and expect sterling to strengthen versus a weaker US dollar over the next 12 months,” said Turner.Underneath the bonnet of the FTSE 100, which is a weighted average of big companies, coronavirus has led to wildly ergent winners and losers. Ocado, the food delivery firm, has leapt in value and now has a total stock market capitalisation (£17bn) that is significantly greater than Sainsbury’s and Morrisons combined. However, British Airways has seen barely any recovery, its shares languishing at a third of their January level.Meanwhile, the millions of UK savers in Nest may cheer the recovery of their funds, but it has little do with the performance of the UK. The five biggest holdings in the Nest default fund are all American: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.Some big investment groups suggest that even if there is a downturn later in the year, the Bank of England will rescue investors by injecting money into the market, known as quantitative easing (QE). Previous rounds of QE have pushed up share prices, although critics say it increases wealth inequality.BNY Mellon Investment Management chief economist, Shamik Dhar, says: “If the recovery does stall, or turns out to be significantly less positive, then I expect the government to step in with further fiscal measures, extending job and income support programmes, and the Bank of England to step in with more QE towards the end of the year.”Fidelity, one of the world’s biggest investment groups, is rather less confident than UBS. Investment director Tom Stevenson said: “No one knows exactly what the recovery from coronavirus will look like – particularly with the potential for a second wave of infections and further local lockdowns - but it is likely that it will be a slow crawl towards pre-Covid levels with further government stimulus needed to restore sustained growth … Much depends on whether rising unemployment creates a negative feedback loop into lower appetite to spend and invest.” Fidelity reckons that holding gold – a standard safe haven in troubled times – may still make sense.Others think shares may already be overpriced. “With consumer demand so fragile and millions of furloughed workers at risk of losing their jobs in the coming months, no one should expect Britons to spend their way out of recession,” said Ulaş Akincilar, the head of trading at an online trading platform, Infinox.“The UK’s recovery is likely to be long and hard, and the strength of UK equities is looking strangely out of kilter with the pain on Britain’s high streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22996e681db0e76edaf043b780ec46f688a1254e/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea56b2598f95e5ae77806cbd41d9224","title":"its the worst ive ever seen londons west end struggles to bounce back covid 19","story":"Mid-August should be boom time for central London. The streets would usually bustle with shoppers, workers and tourists, looking to spend their cash in the West End’s shops, restaurants and leisure attractions.But not this year. Vast swathes of the capital’s streets that once hummed with traffic and pedestrians lie quiet. On Friday morning just a scattering of shoppers were browsing the heavily discounted summer clothes and shoes inside department stores such as Debenhams, John Lewis and Selfridges on Oxford Street, usually Europe’s busiest shopping street.The picture is repeated in Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, as office workers and international travellers stay home, shoppers stay local and day-trippers escape to the country or the seaside.This is felt nowhere as acutely as in London’s West End, a district with relatively few residents and which the vast majority of people usually commute into on public transport.The Salisbury family from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, had ventured to the capital for a short city break to enjoy the tourist attractions without other tourists.Parents Helen and Warren had taken their daughters Jasmine, 10, and Beth, 13, to the Tower of London and London Zoo. Both, they said, were “very quiet”. Reassured by the presence of hand sanitiser stations they felt their visit was “a risk, but a considered one,” said Helen.“It’s the worst that I have ever seen,” said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of NWEC, who has worked in the district for two decades.“In every boardroom decisions are being made,” said Tyrrell. “It’s weeks not months away as to which stores they’ll close, how many redundancies they will make and that’s why it is so fragile and precarious right now.”On Regent Street, two dancers performed routines to pop music, in a bid to draw shoppers into toy emporium Hamleys, but just a handful of customers browsed the seven storeys of toys and games.“When we came at Christmas, we couldn’t get in,” said Elisabeth Walmsley, 34, leaving the store with her husband, Craig, and 11-month-old daughter, Darcia, the proud owner of a new dinosaur toy.Stores in prime shopping locations demand high rents, and in normal times high business rates, which current sales levels don’t come close to covering.Waterstones briefly reopened its Covent Garden branch after lockdown, but “if you can’t cover the lighting (costs) you have to close again”, said Daunt, adding that the problems faced by London are replicated in other European capitals and US cities including New York and Los Angeles.“My real concern isn’t for my own business, even though we are working very hard for not a lot,” said Daun. “Big chains can soak up most things but the little guy is what I worry about, smaller businesses.”Smaller business often depend on serving coffees to and dry cleaning shirts for the nation’s army of office workers.Only a third of UK office workers have gone back to their desks, according to research from US bank Morgan Stanley, a proportion which lags well behind other European nations.On Tottenham Court Road, many of the food outlets which would usually sell salads, soups and sandwiches to a throng of office workers haven’t yet reopened their doors.“Office workers are essential,” said Ros Morgan, chief executive of the Heart of London Business Alliance, which represents 500 retail, cultural and hospitality businesses between Leicester Square and Piccadilly, “I do worry about how long the West End can last without them. We are having conversations about how we can encourage employers to bring their workers back.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has hitherto encouraged Londoners to work from home and steer clear of public transport wherever possible, now considers continued working from home an “existential threat” to the city.Khan is calling for government support for city centres and has highlighted the importance of an improved test-and-trace system. He also wants an extension to the business rates holiday for the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors.Transport, however, remains a major hurdle for bringing visitors back to city centres. London’s tubes and buses are still relatively quiet, but many people equate public transport with being crammed cheek by jowl with strangers in a way that defies any sort of social distancing.Meanwhile, driving into central London comes at a cost of up to £27.50 a day, not including parking costs: at least £15 per day in congestion charge fees, and an additional £12.50 emissions charge for older, more polluting vehicles.In the meantime, until office workers return, there are very few overseas tourists, who usually account for half of the West End’s £10bn annual turnover, to plug the gap.“There are no customers and this is a big shop,” said Shafiq Ahmad, 26, gesturing out of the window of the Souvenirs \u0026amp Luggage store on Oxford Street, currently staffed by two people instead of the usual 12.“This shop depends on tourists,” said Ahmad. “At the moment we are running with zero to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/572b4bccbf196fcccfb6516606b1d62fe02b6af3/0_173_3096_1859/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2542ab9530ec1a4d38b19fcdf40fefcf","title":"never knowingly under leased john lewis moves to rent out its furniture","story":"Chain targets shoppers such as millennials for whom renting goods rather than owning them is normalIt’s typically been the preserve of landlords and property dressers trying to sell a home, but furniture rental could be about to go mainstream. From Monday, high street favourite John Lewis will be renting out sofas, sideboards and desks, as part of the plan to remodel its business announced last month.Tenants who are in short-term lets, or shoppers who want to try before they buy, can choose between 50 different items from the retailer’s range. Prices start at £17 a month for a desk or chair rented for 12 months, and rise for larger goods on shorter contracts.Johnathan Marsh, partner \u0026amp director of Home at John Lewis, said the retailer was trying to appeal to “the next generation of customers” who are used to sharing items such as bikes and cars rather than owning them outright.“Attitudes towards renting items and the sharing economy have dramatically shifted in recent years, and we know that renting, reselling items and recycling them is a growing priority for our customers,” he said.Marsh said the service was also a sustainable choice, with items collected and repaired at the end of each rental and sent to new customers.A Soren office chair, which may see some people through the rest of their time working from home in style, retails at £399 and starts at £17 a month for hire. For a sofa costing £1,899 new, rental is £80 a month for 12 months, going up to £190 a month for a three-month deal. Six-month prices are also available. Delivery costs £9.99 and there is no charge for collection.The items will be rented via a third-party site, Fat Llama, with the service available initially just in London but set to roll out nationally soon if successful.Chaz Englander, CEO of Fat Llama, expects the UK to follow the US, where “renting furniture instead of owning it is becoming the new normal for millennials a generation that is moving house every 12 months.”Returned items will be cleaned and then re-let to new customers.The scheme means shoppers can use the service to try before they buy – payments stop if they reach the original purchase price before the end of the hire period, and they can keep the item or have it collected. After two 12-month rental periods the items will have been paid for outright.However, the insurance provided covers only standard wear and tear, so renters should take care: the cost of covering household disasters such as red wine spillage will be passed straight on to the customer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bce8d6d05dfb3c60448191e635fb16643ba8a29/0_6_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99ca6a4d05397b15de195d59cbfc593","title":"clusterpocalyse heading our way stock up on good times","story":"We should be watching movies that have nothing to do with the current depressing situationExciting news, everyone: this winter will be terrible! This is palpably and collectively beginning to sink in, with conversations transitioning from, “It seems like we’ve flattened the curve now, right?” to “Oh, the apocalypse is coming. Well, something to put in the diary at last, I guess.” In case anyone was daring to nurture a flicker of optimism, a recent article by the Spectator’s political editor, James Forsyth, dampened that spark: “This winter the government could be dealing with flu, Covid-19, flooding, mass unemployment and all the issues arising from the end of the Brexit transition period. The cabinet is assessing how ready the state is to handle multiple crises at once.” Haha – Brexit! Oh my God, remember that? Brexit feels like the annoying boyfriend you’d forgotten about because your house burned down. And as you clear the ashes from what was your life, you realise he’s still there, holding a boombox.I’m going to take a casual punt here and say the state will probably be not that ready to deal with this incoming clusterpocalypse, judging by the past and current state of affairs. But we can be more prepared than we were for lockdown which, I would wager, took most of us by surprise. Not all of us, of course: my father was sending me emails about the coronavirus from late January, which I merrily ignored. For many of us who grew up in the 1990s – an era so comparatively drama-free it birthed a genre of films in which the protagonists had to make up fictional villains (Fight Club, The Game) because even Hollywood admitted there weren’t really any threats any more – it took a while to realise how bad things were. And now, they are going to get worse.We can’t control life’s circumstances, but this time we can brace for them and learn from the mistakes of lockdown part one. So can everyone please chill on the toilet paper obsession this time? There was the inevitable guff last spring about Britain’s famed “blitz spirit”. But unless people spent the blitz sniping on Twitter about who has a cleaner, I didn’t see much evidence of that mythical characteristic. My personal low point was when I wasted far too much time on what was otherwise a lovely birthday arguing online about whether parenting during lockdown is as spirit-crushing as so many parents were saying (allow me to take advantage of my privileged platform here to get the last word in: yes, it bloody is.) So please, everyone, myself very much included, let us find ways to deal with anxiety that don’t involve being an absolute dick online.We need to make like squirrels and gather nuts for winter, and by nuts I mean movies that spark conversations that have nothing to do with the current depressing situation. For instance, Back To The Future is, obviously, the most amazing movie made, from its script to its casting to the way it makes near incest seem not entirely creepy, which is a lot harder than making the mafia relatable in The Godfather. Hell, Goodfellas and The Sopranos did that – what else but BTTF has waved the flag for some hot mum-on-son flirtation? And yet… Now, nitpicking about logic in a movie about a time-travelling DeLorean might seem a stretch even for me, but if Marty McFly’s parents, George and Lorraine, met him when they were teenagers, how did they explain it to themselves when one of their children grows up to look identical to this friend they once had? Wouldn’t George think Lorraine had been having a secret affair with his former best friend, especially as she insisted on naming their child after him? You’d be amazed how often I think about this (actually, maybe you wouldn’t). Anyway, this puzzler will get you through many a gloomy winter evening.“Comfort read”, as some people call it, or, as I call it, “read”. Not synthetically cheerful books, but depressing ones probably aren’t ideal: a book about Kristallnacht turned out not to be quite the escapist read I needed during lockdown, surprisingly. Instead, I loved Darren Coffield’s melancholic Tales From The Colony Room, because it made me feel as if I was out drinking in Soho, and grateful that I wasn’t.Finally, stock up on the good times. I went to Prague with friends the last weekend of February, and I hugged the memory close during lockdown. So go for pub garden meet-ups with friends, socially distanced walks with your parents, birthday parties in the park. Because we may not know what the weather will bring, but we do know that summer fades, and clouds are gathering.

For weeks they had prepared tentatively to go to university, not sure if their hard work would be recognised. In recent days, they had followed the furore and then capitulation in Scotland and the government’s sudden announcement that mock exam grades could be used to challenge their results.When they opened their envelopes, socially distancing and disinfecting beforehand, most were simply relieved and thrilled that a summer of worry and uncertainty had finally come to an end. However, there were too many who felt really let down, angry with a system that meant the predictions of their teachers were not affirmed, or disappointed that their teachers had not shown greater belief in their potential. Overwhelmingly, a positive day for most was punctuated by confusion, doubt and despair for many.How did we get here? With schools and colleges shut and exams cancelled, teachers were asked to predict the grade, and crucially the ranking, for each of their students. This is a thankless task for any teacher. In any given class, you may have 10 students who have the potential to achieve an A but only five or six will actually get the grade, and right until the results are published you never know who it will be. Similarly, you tend to know who your very brightest students are, and those who struggle the most in your class, but it is nigh on impossible to determine who should be ranked where in between.That’s the uncertainty that asking teachers to predict grades and rankings cannot resolve. Exams resolve this uncertainty, but there were no exams this summer.Teachers understandably did what all good teachers would be expected to do. Faced with the uncertainty of not knowing which of the 10 will secure an A grade and the requirement by the exam board to choose winners and losers, they erred on the side of their learners and predicted a few more than they would normally expect to achieve each year.As a result, the predictions made by teachers would have meant so many more top grades being awarded that it would have potentially devalued the qualification. Universities, faced with a surge of young people having achieved entry requirements and a cap on their numbers, could not be expected to honour their offers. It would also be grossly unfair to the young people whose teachers predicted judiciously and the many tens of thousands (the majority) who had very little difference between their predicted grades and the grades issued by the exam board.So, faced with the certainty of knowing teachers had predicted far more top grades than could be reasonably awarded, Ofqual and the government made the understandable decision to standardise the estimates. By looking at how the subject had performed in each school or college over the past three years, they capped how many of each of the grades could be awarded.However, no formula can account for the uncertainty and iniduality of each cohort and of each young person in every class. It cannot allow for the surprise result, the student who pulls through and achieves a grade they never looked like delivering all year and the young person who fails the paper despite looking so consistently assured in class.With so much at stake, our young people receiving their GCSE and A-level results should not have been subjected to a purely algorithmic calculation that puts a ceiling on the grades they achieve simply because of how well (or badly) their peers performed in past years. It’s just not the message that a meritocratic society wants to give to a young person today, particularly those from our most disadvantaged communities who already face so many hurdles and glass ceilings in life. So what are we to do?Urgently, we need to move quickly to an appeal process that allows learners to challenge their grade if it is patently wrong. Some headteachers have reported “unfathomable” grades for some of their students and these need to be resolved quickly. The government must also cover all fees for appeals this year – it cannot be right that this year, of all years, schools and colleges should pay for them.Furthermore, for those students who have missed out on the grades they need by a small margin, colleges and universities need to show maximum discretion and flexibility. In particular, if a student has missed out on their entry requirements by just a grade, and the teacher predictions were higher, they should be admitted. If needed, we should lift the cap on university numbers so that this does not become a constraint to enabling young people to progress during these extraordinary times.In addition, universities should consider deferring the start of some of their courses to December or January to allow for the results of appeals and the special exam series in the autumn to be completed by learners.We also need to redouble our efforts with disadvantaged students. The exam results system – like so much of our society – is not designed to be biased, but it reflects and exacerbates the inequality and injustice that blights so many of our communities. We need a new national effort to close this gap, adequately fund and support the schools that serve the disadvantaged, and more robustly mandate universities and employers to ensure fairer representation for them.Finally, we need to ensure that this never happens again. Schools were rightly closed and exams rightly cancelled this summer – something I called for in March. However, we cannot afford to put thousands of young people and their parents and teachers through such turmoil again. We need to develop a better system for rewarding the efforts of our young people in such contingencies, and have the foresight and fortitude to deliver it effectively.• Hamid Patel is chief executive of Star Academies, a multi-academy trust that runs a network of primary and secondary schools across England"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1007ee106acf861bfd6a431468749558c890ec9b/0_225_3368_2021/master/3368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a7dda7776b8f19bd755821abcde897","title":"uk museums turn to innovation to keep doors open in times of covid","story":"Virtual field trips and dynamic stylus are some of proposals that received Art Fund’s grantsVirtual field trips, a dynamic stylus and the digitisation of a vast aviation archive are three of the ideas British museums have come up with as a way to future-proof their offering in the face of damaging Covid-19 restrictions.The museums are among the first successful batch of applicants awarded Respond and Reimagine grants by the Art Fund, which split £600,000 between 18 projects that came up with new ways of working during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Box in Plymouth was due to open in spring with an Antony Gormley commission and an ambitious exhibition to mark the 400 year anniversary of the Mayflower, but was forced to postpone until September because of Covid-19 restrictions. Its successful Art Fund bid for £25,000 will be spent on developing a stylus that visitors can use to interact with digital exhibitions and audiovisual elements when it opens.Abigail Netcott, marketing and development manager at the Box, said developing the devices was essential as cleaning interactive exhibits every time a visitor used one was not feasible. Instead visitors will be given the stylus and can use it to interact with exhibits.Netcott said: “I think we can measure success by customer experience and that’s the focus for us now. We have significantly reduced capacity because of Covid-19, so we’re roughly going to run on about a third of anticipated visitors.”Aerospace Bristol was another successful applicant and received £30,000 to turn its vast archive of aviation industry artefacts and documentation into a “digital storytelling experience”. The museum is developing an app for people to use on their own devices which will make the photographs, glass plate negatives, drawings, film footage, minute books and accounts contained in its archive accessible remotely.Aerospace Bristol’s marketing manager, Adam Jones, said because a lot of the visitors to the museum are elderly and in an at-risk group, the digitisation of the archive is a way for them to engage with the museum without physically having to come in. “They’re the kind of people that at the moment, might not feel quite as comfortable visiting, or might have some concerns. So if we can take that material to them then obviously, that gets rid of the problem.”Portia Tremlett, public programme engagement officer for the Novium Museum in Chichester, said its successful idea – to create virtual field trips for school children to learn about the Romans – was designed to take pressure off of teachers and develop less hands-on experiences which no longer work in a socially-distanced environment.“Even when schools can do external trips, all the risks and costs associated with it are quite prohibitive,” she said. “So what we wanted to do was create something virtual, so schools could get that same experience of learning outside the classroom without leaving theirs.”Schools will be able to purchase the virtual tours from the Novium, which is also offering “loan boxes” that contain objects to support learning with the scheme being piloted via local schools in the area. Tremlett added that even local schools could struggle to afford a physical trip to the museum because of transportation costs and logistics, so the virtual tours could become a permanent fixture in the future.“Obviously, anything that is hands-on and involves touching is not really what people want to do right now. So with virtual field trips, we’re then going to adapt them so that they can become a kind of digital interactive offer within the museum,” she added.This week the government published guidance for cultural institutions applying for £270m in repayable cultural finance from the government’s £1.57bn art support package, which was announced in the first week of July. Part of the criteria for accessing the funds includes being able to demonstrate “national or international significance” and opportunities to engage their local communities “through education and outreach”.The director of Art Fund, Jenny Waldman, said the organisation had been “inundated with applications” for the grants, which will total £1.5m, adding that traditional funding models have been shattered by the Covid-19 crisis. “It is hugely encouraging to see ambitious and creative proposals from museums all over the country who are passionate about serving their local communities and engaging audiences, despite very challenging circumstances and devastating loss of income,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e9b2e77217043666a37a099fee33b36d8f55c2/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f151bb0183d37b8625bfa6b7954f9c","title":"zaido the ancient japanese ritual to bring good luck in pictures","story":"After the death of her father and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Yukari Chikura found solace by travelling to a remote village to document the 1,300-year-old annual ceremony.

These are just some of the threats to Britain’s wild places as record numbers enjoy coastal and countryside “staycations”.Beleaguered rangers complain that a new generation of holidaymakers are treating the countryside like a festival site, leaving behind tents, chairs and excrement, as well as endangering rare habitats and wildlife.“It’s like no previous law of behaviour applies,” said one warden in Devon, whosecoastal nature reserve has been the busiest he has seen it in 40 years. “Anything you would expect people to understand, such as littering or people using the countryside as a lavatory, they ignore.”Conservationists and landowners are particularly concerned by the escalating fire risk with tinderbox conditions at many beauty spots, and a surge in wild campers – or “fly-campers” – lighting fires and portable barbecues.A fire destroyed 140 acres of heathland on Chobham Common, Surrey, last weekend. During the last bank holiday weekend, more than 20 serious moorland and grassland fires devastated areas in the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales and New Forest.The British Mountaineering Council is calling for the use of disposable barbecues on open moorland to be made a criminal offence.In Dartmoor, one of the few places in England where wild camping is legal, the Dartmoor National Park Authority has deployed emergency powers to temporarily ban wild camping after a dramatic increase in “fly-camping” at Bellever, where more than 50 fire pits were dug into the moor on one night. The authorities hope the August-long ban will give the beauty spot time to recover.Craig Best, the National Trust’s countryside manager for West Yorkshire, said his team feared a big moorland fire. “We’ve got the bank holiday weekend looming and even when the moorlands are tinder-dry there’ll be every chance two or three iniduals will be having a barbecue there, and they can so easily get out of control,” he said.“It’s almost like a perfect storm,” he added, citing the combination of post-lockdown liberation, the heatwave and the long closure of household recycling centres, which caused a huge increase in fly-tipping.Problems reported by rangers include unprecedented wild camping in the Lake District huge quantities of nitrous oxide canisters discarded over Marsden Moor, close to Manchester, Leeds and Huddersfield illegal speedboating in the Ore estuary in Suffolk and huge quantities of excrement, even where toilets are open because visitors are avoiding public toilets due to coronavirus fears.The Devon coastal reserve warden, who asked to remain anonymous, said he found a family had dismantled a “dead hedge” (a feature used to provide wildlife habitat) to make a teepee, decorating it with yellow flag irises that they dug up. “They just couldn’t understand that it wasn’t acceptable,” he said.Some visitors have argued that pictures of rubbish piled up beside bins demonstrate that more bins are required, or that they need emptying more regularly. But conservationists say people should take their rubbish home.“You’re seeing the worst part of human nature and a deterioration in the habitats you’re trying to manage because you’re having to concentrate on emptying bins,” said the Devon warden.Jake Fiennes, the director of the Holkham estate, which manages England’s largest national nature reserve, said 20,000 people were visiting the estate’s beach, in the Norfolk Coast area of natural beauty, each day. Reported incidents include kites being flown where terns nest, disturbing the birds, and a resting seal pup being picked up and flung back into the water.“It’s crazy, absolutely crazy. Every day feels like an August bank holiday,” Fiennes said. “It’s a totally different demographic – north Norfolk coast visitors are usually pretty middle class but we’re not seeing the older birders anymore, we’re seeing a lot of young people. The positive is we have a chance to engage with a whole different section of society.”Fiennes said knowledge of the Countryside Code seemed to have “fallen by the wayside” among today’s young. “Shouldn’t the natural world be part of our national curriculum?” he asked.But conservationists are desperate not to appear unwelcoming to a new generation of younger, urban visitor.“We’ve got to be careful as a sector about saying you can only come into the countryside if you’ve studied the Countryside Code,” said Ben McCarthy, the National Trust’s head of nature and conservation ecology. “The long-term solution to recovering nature has to be better engagement and better experiences for the widest range of the public. There’s good evidence that once people have positive experiences in nature they start to have pro-environmental attitudes.”Nikki Williams of The Wildlife Trusts said the tension between unprecedented numbers of visitors and rare species in fragile habitats showed the importance of ensuring people had access to local nature and didn’t simply drive to beauty-spots.“You go to a place labelled ‘countryside’. It’s a visitor experience, whereas it should be integrated into our lives,” she said. “We advocate for a nature recovery network. A really important part of that is more on-your-doorstep nature. Then you start to understand more about nature and you also don’t get in the car and drive to a place that has a line drawn around it and says ‘This is where the good stuff is.’”The Wildlife Trusts are particularly concerned that the government’s new planning white paper ides the country into protected zones and areas of development and regeneration – exacerbating the idea that “nature” is an excursion to an overvisited, distant nature reserve.Nick Bruce-White, the RSPB’s regional director of southern England, said: “This interest in the outdoors and green space is something we couldn’t have wished for six months ago. I hope we can build on it. There’s a small minority of people who are doing wantonly illegal things and a bigger cohort of new visitors who, without sounding too patronising, don’t understand the basics of how to use the countryside appropriately.”Bruce-White said the RSPB, alongside the National Farmers’ Union and others, were pushing the government to include more messaging about responsible enjoyment of the countryside in its Covid-19 broadcasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187d9f2bab0954debf03ede32a871f50f7ddd307/0_144_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74de4209160fe0d35f05070be2039969","title":"jellyfish bloom reports soar from cornwall to the outer hebrides","story":"Busy beaches and warm, calm seas fuel sightings of lion’s manes, compasses and moonsFrom a “mile-long” swarm in Devon to warnings to swimmers in the Outer Hebrides, it seems jellyfish are difficult to ignore this summer.High temperatures, calm and warm seas and packed beaches have resulted in large numbers of reports of jellyfish blooms around the UK coast, and combined with a glut of the plankton on which they feed, some are reaching record sizes, experts said.At the fishing town of Brixham, Devon, one kayaker and photographer witnessed what he described as a mile-long mass of compass jellyfish. They have also been spotted in large numbers along the Cornish coast.“They are very beautiful, with amazing markings, a whiteish jellyfish with black stripes running from the centre to the outside of their umbrella,” said Matt Slater of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. “And really long tentacles, which can impart a sting. It hurts a bit but the pain dies off in about ten minutes.”At the other end of the country, swimmers off the Isle of Lewis have had to contend with a group of lion’s mane jellyfish, which have a very nasty sting. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a Sherlock Holmes short story in which one was responsible for a mysterious death. “We would ask people to keep away from this type of jellyfish and not touch them,” the Stornaway coastguard said.Galway city council in Ireland issued a similar warning after the same species was spotted at Silverstrand beach. It advised swimmers to be extremely vigilant and to approach a lifeguard for assistance if stung.The common moon jellyfish has been abundant in Devon, while in north-east England Sunderland city council issued a warning to swimmers and dog walkers after large numbers of blue jellyfish washed up on Seaburn beach.Coral Smith, a marine education officer at Devon Wildlife Trust, said: “This year the compass jellies have been very big, up to their maximum of about 30 centimetres. That’s unusual.” She credits this to plentiful plankton and the warmer weather. “And nice calm waters means they stick around. They are not getting washed out to sea again.”Dr Victoria Hobson, a lecturer in marine ecology at Exeter University and a jellyfish expert, believes it is not an exceptional year for jellyfish blooms, but rather that the creatures are more visible.“The weather’s been really lovely and it’s been quite calm, so better to see them. It’s been gloriously warm, and they like to come up to bask nearer the surface,” she said. With furlough, and staycations, “more people are out on the water, so a lot more eyes looking”.Blooms come and go. One year one species will be abundant, the next another. “Blooms are caused by jelly fish polyps living on the sea bed feeding on plankton,” said Slater. “If there is plentiful food they will get fat and bud off into thousands of tiny baby jellyfish. You get huge swarms travelling and drifting in the ocean currents, and hoping they never end up on a beach.”The advice to swimmers who have been stung is to scrape off any remaining tentacles using something similar to a credit card, and not to rub the area. They should rinse it with warm sea water, but avoid fresh water because it can cause further irritation. They should also be alert to the possibility of anaphylactic shock.They should not urinate on the affected area. “That’s the old wives tale, but it doesn’t work for all jellyfish and it’s very embarrassing,” said Slater. “And if you’ve been stung by a portuguese man o’war it’s the worst thing you can do. It makes the pain ten times worse.”Though not a true jellyfish, the portuguese man o’war is sometimes found in UK waters in late summer and early summer. It has a sting powerful enough to kill fish and occasionally even humans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ba5bc94643a33d6eb207ab8f9408f2e183c8592/794_556_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c35bbd22511be1a627e7763694a500ff","title":"the best holiday scents at home too","story":"Easy, wearable fragrances to transport you to that post-shower pre-aperitif golden hour wherever you areI type with one eye on travel news, hoping, like many thousands of Britons, not to see my summer holiday shelved. It could be considerably worse, and should I have to return the cutoff Levi’s, vest tops and what was worryingly described online as a “linen rompersuit” (I am 45) to their attic storage, I will not forsake my holiday scent wardrobe.There’s something extremely intoxicating and gladdening about holiday scents. Easy, carefree and wearable, they evoke that very moment when, after a long day in the sun anywhere from Newquay to Nice, one emerges for dinner, freshly showered, skin hot, hair still salty through the shampoo, mouth glossed and gasping for an aperitif. I need any summer holiday scent to transport me to that golden hour in an instant, whether or not my flight’s grounded.Guerlain’s ever-revolving collection of Aqua Allegoria fragrances are summer, bottled. They’re simpler, breezier, more linear fragrances than the Guerlain house icons (Shalimar, Mitsouko et al), which is not at all to say they’re not wonderful: you really must check out Herba Fresca (£63, 75ml), an extraordinarily lovely and still unsurpassed scent of mixed soft green herbs and grass. Aqua Allegoria’s latest is my favourite in a while, and takes my head somewhere cheery. Orange Soleia (£53.55, 75ml) smells exactly like a hot blood orange being torn open, the zesty juice misting its surroundings like an aromatic sprinkler system. It’s ine, and just the sort of fragrance I crave after a sticky day at the beach.I hesitate to mention Bronze Goddess Azur (£44, 50ml) because I’ve already raved about the original over the years, but Azur is notable for being, in my view, Estée Lauder’s only successful deviation from the faultless “Eau Fraiche Skinscent” (now available year round). This limited edition take on Bronze Goddess is less coconutty and rounded, more citrus and salt, like a tequila slammer at sunset.Another perfume that smells good enough to ingest (best not, though) is Jo Loves Mango Thai Lime (£70, 50ml). I was instinctively against this cologne (I’m baffled by mangoes. Too fibrous and weirdly rich), but the accompanying handwash proved to be my gateway drug. Both variants are absolutely delicious. Juicy, spicy and mouthwatering, with – to my nose – a dash of fizzy Lilt, Mango Thai Lime manages to circumvent all the reasons I avoid fruity fragrances and truly sent me wandering down the Co-op to give mangoes a final shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c6bdfd2104d17b540a8f574dbc74aab87875c29/0_1787_3626_2173/master/3626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f17a87adb1dcf0242f53c511d5f01ad2","title":"from tomato salad to persian noodles yotam ottolenghis cooling summer recipes","story":"A fresh, bright feast that means little time in a hot kitchen: a garlicky, gingery tomato salad, a classic melon and feta salad with toasted seeds for crunch, and an icy, sweet noodle dishI write this on the hottest day of the year so far. With the sun glaring through my window and the outside calling my name, a hot kitchen is the last thing on my mind. That’s not to be confused with food, of course, which is always on my mind. Luckily, today’s recipes are all about fresh, bright dishes that are cooling and soothing and involve very little actual cooking. Zesty lime and tomatoes, creamy cheese and summer fruit, sweet noodles and icy granita: cooling food to offset the scorching sun and temper the spirits with a proper summertime meal.The punchy dressing, with its garlic, ginger and fish sauce, is what makes this salad so special. Use whatever mixture of tomatoes you can get your hands on, and serve alongside a range of other veg dishes to create a summer spread. If you want to make the salad vegetarian- and vegan-friendly, swap the fish sauce for a tablespoon and a half of soy sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking.

Strain through a sieve set over a bowl to catch the oil, then leave the oil to cool for about 10 minutes. Transfer the solids to a plate lined with absorbent paper, where they will crisp up further.Once the oil has cooled a little, use a fork to whisk in the lime zest and juice, fish sauce and coriander.Gently toss all the tomatoes with a teaspoon of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper, then arrange on a platter with the sliced red onion, so everything sits in a single layer and overlaps slightly. Spoon over the dressing, scatter on the crisp ginger and garlic, and serve right away.Watermelon and feta is a classic combination, but honeydew also goes wonderfully well with feta (or mozzarella, so use whichever you prefer). The caramelised pumpkin seeds are a great recipe in their own right. Triple the amounts and keep the excess in a glass jar, ready to sprinkle on salads, toast or just to snack on. 1 large banana shallot, peeled and cut into thin rounds2 lemons – zest finely grated, to get ½ tsp, and juiced, to get 60mlFlaked sea salt and black pepper50g pumpkin seeds2 tbsp maple syrup60ml olive oil10 basil leaves, washed and patted dry2½-3 tbsp (10g) mint leaves, washed and patted dry1 ripe honeydew melon, peeled, halved, deseeded and cut into 4cm chunks200g buffalo mozzarella (or feta), roughly torn into chunksHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. In a small bowl, mix the shallots with the lemon juice and a good pinch of flaked salt. In a second bowl, mix the pumpkin seeds with the maple syrup, a good grind of pepper and a pinch of salt. Spread out on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, then roast for 15 minutes, until crisp. Remove, sprinkle with more flaked salt and set aside to cool.Meanwhile, put the oil in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the basil and mint leaves and fry, swirling the pan constantly, for a minute, until crisp and fragrant. Strain through a sieve set over a small bowl, and reserve the oil and crisp leaves separately. Sprinkle the herbs with flaked salt.Arrange the melon and mozzarella (or feta) on a platter. Drizzle over the aromatic oil, then cover with the shallots and lemon juice mixture. Finish with the lemon zest, fried herbs and pumpkin seeds, and serve.Faloodeh is a popular Persian dessert made with vermicelli and a frozen syrup. Sweet noodles might seem strange to some, but trust me, these cold, sweet and refreshing all at once, and just the thing for a hot day. Get ahead by cooking the noodles and making the granita and syrup the day before, then put them together quickly just before serving. 220g caster sugar5-6 tbsp (20g) mint, leaves and sprigs300ml water150 lime juice100g dried vermicelli rice noodles – I use Thai Taste’sFor the syrup200ml pomegranate juice (unsweetened)1 tbsp caster sugar1½ tsp good-quality rosewaterTo serve3 tbsp pomegranate seeds1 large lime – zest finely grated, to get 1½ tsp, then cut into 6 wedgesPut the sugar, mint and water in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then add the lime juice and leave to cool completely. Strain into a container, discarding the solids, then cover and freeze for about two hours. Use a fork to scrape at the half-frozen mixture, bringing the more frozen edges into the centre, then return to the freezer and repeat, scraping at the mixture every half-hour or so, for four more hours. You should end up with a snowflake-like granita.Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, then cook the noodles for six minutes, or until very soft (you want to overcook them a little). Drain, use a pair of scissors to cut the noodles roughly in half, then store in the fridge.For the pomegranate syrup, put the juice and sugar in a medium saucepan on a medium heat, and cook for 20-25 minutes, until reduced to the consistency of maple syrup. Stir in the rosewater and leave to cool.When you are almost ready to serve up, fill a large bowl with cold water and plenty of ice, drop in the cooked vermicelli, and return to the fridge for about 10 minutes, so the noodles get very cold.Remove the lime granita from the fridge about five to 10 minutes before you want to serve, scraping at it again with a fork, to increase that snowflake effect.Working quickly now, drain the noodles, wipe out the bowl to dry, then return the noodles to it with half the granita, and toss well to combine – some of the noodles will start to solidify a little in the cold of the granita, which is what you want. Divide between six small glass bowls or martini glasses, and top with the remaining granita. Drizzle a spoonful of the syrup over each serving, sprinkle with the pomegranate seeds and lime zest, and serve with the lime wedges for squeezing on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0126023ecbc8f1778ad3873152befefb1bf639a9/0_841_3693_2215/master/3693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef2bbaf8b23c580a86ffe4f02e2da746","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe one pot tomato lemongrass and coconut soba noodles","story":"A pot noodle with a touch of class: blitz your own paste, fry, add tomatoes and coconut, pop in noodles and you’re doneIn June 2013, a bold step forward in the cooking of pasta occurred when Martha Stewart made a one-pot spaghetti by putting all the ingredients for the sauce, pasta and cooking water in the same pan. What emerged nine minutes later was a perfectly cooked meal. As a food writer, such dishes – where technique, time and flavour come together in perfect harmony – are the holy grail of all recipes. In homage to Stewart’s original, here is my very own one-pot noodle recipe.Check the ingredients list on your soba noodles – they’re traditionally made with buckwheat, but many brands combine that with wheat flour, too, so are not gluten-free.

Set a wide pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once hot, add the paste and cook, stirring, for three to four minutes, until it releases its oils into the pan. Stir in the tomatoes, pop on the lid and cook, stirring only occasionally so as not to break up the tomatoes, for five to six minutes, until they collpase and go soft and a little jammy.Pour in the coconut milk, then fill up the empty tin one and a half times with water (600ml) and add that to the pan, too. Gently stir in the salt, then bring the mixture to a boil. Drop in the noodles, so they’re submerged, and leave to bubble away for about five minutes, until tender.

That he has almost 10 million Instagram followers, films rap videos in his spare time, gets his hair cut every week? That during lockdown, he earned the wrath of animal rights groups by posing for photographs with a baby liger? That he failed at Manchester United?In other words: which of the multitude of extraordinary tales swirling around Depay are relevant, and which are just noise?Often we like to compartmentalise the actions of footballers into the “on-field” and the “off-field”: the essential and the extraneous, the part that matters, and the part that doesn’t. But this is a distinction that is harder to make for Depay, a man whose feats and foibles seem to spring from the same howling instinct: an urge to express himself.You can see it everywhere: from the flair and risk in his game to the brassy social media persona, from his rhymes (sample lyric: “Catch a vibe in Paris, young king living lavish, back in Lyon going savage, they be waiting for hat-tricks”) to his deadly finishing. There’s a story from one of his early outings with the Dutch national team, when he humiliates Robin van Persie with a flamboyant stepover during a training game. “Who do you think you are?” a furious van Persie screams at the young winger. “You’re nothing!”Later that day, Depay is sitting in his hotel room, distraught and despondent, when there’s a knock on the door. “I was sitting on the loo,” Depay remembers in his autobiography, Heart of a Lion (yes: he’s written a book, and a compulsively honest one at that, despite its vaguely Partridge-esque tone). “Although I wasn’t actually finished, I quickly wiped my bum, ran out of the bathroom, opened the door, and sure enough: Robin. He’d come to apologise.” The reader is left to speculate whether their rapprochement was sealed with a handshake.This is the enigma of Depay, a man who through his many complexities and contradictions, his heartfelt no-filter delivery, almost dares you to misunderstand him. In the Netherlands they know him as the brazen tearaway whose talent may finally be catching up with his prodigious ego. In France they know him as Lyon’s captain and talisman, dragging a maladjusted club to their first Champions League quarter-final in a decade. In England, meanwhile, Depay is still best remembered as the “United reject”, a misfiring winger who encapsulated the wasteful anaemia of the Louis van Gaal years.Depay arrived at United from PSV in 2015, the same summer Van Persie left: a symbol of renewal and rebirth, inheriting the No 7 shirt worn by Best, Cantona, Ronaldo. But Van Gaal’s stilted, structured machine offered little scope for expression, and as he drifted out of first-team contention under José Mourinho, life took on a darker hue. Isolated from his entourage and his mother, he would spend his days confined to the mansion he had rented from Phil Neville, his nights driving listlessly around the Manchester countryside. One day, returning home from another game he had watched from the stands, he finally snapped. Out of nowhere he started screaming, lashing out, hurling objects around his kitchen in a blind rage.It was the wake-up call he needed. Adrift, alone, stripped not just of his professional dignity but his simple enjoyment of the game, Depay left United in early 2017, resolving to choose his next move with utmost care. He hired an analytics company called SciSports to find him a club that matched his specifications: a quick attacking style, the freedom to roam without too many defensive duties, and a vacancy at left-wing. Lyon fitted the bill, and in a freer attacking role the goals have begun to flow: 53 in 135 games, forming productive partnerships first with Nabil Fekir and more recently Moussa Dembélé and Bertrand Traoré.A cruciate injury in December threatened to derail his season, putting him out of Euro 2020 into the bargain. In his absence Lyon struggled, limping to seventh place in Ligue 1. But the pandemic has come to Depay’s rescue, giving him time to regain fitness and return to Rudi Garcia’s side as the attacking spearhead in a 3-5-2 formation. It was his goal that eliminated Juventus in the last 16, an outrageous Panenka penalty that sealed victory on away goals. “Playing with him and without him,” Garcia observes, “are not the same thing.” On Saturday night they face Manchester City in the quarter-finals.Perhaps in Depay’s jarring fall and stirring rise lies a salutary antidote to a game of sharp, sweeping judgments. It’s easy to forget that he was 21 when he arrived at United and 22 when he left: written off, sold for scrap, assailed by snide jibes about his spending, his lifestyle and appearance. To this day his affectations and side hustles, his ostentatious displays of wealth, his unswerving determination to do whatever the hell he wants, continue to make him a magnet for criticism. And if, as rumoured, he eventually joins one of Europe’s biggest clubs, you wonder how his fierce iniduality and brazen expressiveness will fit into a sport becoming ever more rigidly systematised at its elite end.But zoom out a little and the real story here is one of overwhelming triumph against the odds. After being abandoned by his father, he and his mother were subjected to prolonged abuse by his new step-family. The most harrowing passages of his book are those where he lucidly recalls the beatings he received, the breaking glass, the doors being kicked down. “I started to find it almost normal to get hit,” he writes. He dealt soft drugs and was expelled from multiple schools. Bullied into silence, he sought expression through other outlets. Music allowed him to articulate his emotions in a way real life could not. And football would be his helicopter out of misery.And so, when you have come this far, why stop now? Why limit yourself to Lyon, to football, to one career, to one view of the world? Depay wants it all. He wants to exalt the glory of God and help the deaf and blind children of Ghana, and he wants to pose on his yacht in a £20,000 jacket. He wants the lion tattoo on his back and the real thing on his shoulder. He wants the Champions League, the big move, the accolades, the money in the bank, the album, the book, the film, the fame. It all matters. Or nothing does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9662a07d27cb740ceab1b96324e3e71b91678f6a/0_3_1023_614/master/1023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccdbd69766d8bd4e37eb8a897430b5c2","title":"families trying to cross the channel dunkirk france","story":"More families arrive in Dunkirk each day and they would rather sleep in woods than seek asylum in France“They are kids, so they are always playing.

They have speech delays, they have no fine motor skills.”The older children suffer most, she says. “They are conscious of what they are missing out on. They know what it is to sleep in a bed and feel safe.”This week as Boris Johnson and Priti Patel promised to make the Channel crossings “unviable”, more families arrived each day in Dunkirk. Parents came carrying babies or pushing toddlers in buggies, older children stepping in to translate.Last year Project Play worked with around 1,300 children in northern France, most of them trying to reach the UK. Turnover is faster now and children do not stay as long. With the number of lorry journeys through the tunnel down owing to coronavirus lockdown measures, more than 4,000 people have made it to Britain by sea this year.Last weekend, as volunteers from the Refugee Women’s Centre walked through the nature reserve looking for people who might need help, a family stepped out of the trees.Father, mother and grandmother, they had three children with them aged two to seven. They had arrived on a lorry from Romania and the father was desperate to find somewhere for them to sleep.The father pulled his smiling seven-year-old forward and asked him to open his mouth. The boy grinned with a row of rotting, blackened teeth. “We had no access to any healthcare or a dentist in Romania. We were in a tiny room, five of us in 5 by 3 metres, no school or healthcare for eight months,” he said.He wants to be near the Channel in case he can cross. “If we make it to the UK, my children can go to school. And I’d rather spend years here than get sent back to Iraq.”Though it is hard to grasp at first sight why any family would sleep in a wood rather than apply for asylum in France, the families and the charities who support them say the official accommodation centres are dirty, frightening and inappropriate for vulnerable families.Armed police try to get families on to buses, tearing up tents. After a certain number of days families must apply to stay in France, and many do not want to do that.One father told Fallowfield: “If the French would give us even basic support, I would go to the accommodation centre for my children’s sake. But they treat us like animals.”Like other families here, he sees trying to reach the UK as his only option. “I have destroyed my life for my children to have a better future. I don’t want my kids to grow up where someone can brainwash them and make them kill for a living. Islamic State came to our country and that’s why I have come to this shit place. It’s the hardest job in the world being a parent.”The numbers here are a fraction of all the children seeking protection across Europe. In Greece, 25,000 under-18s arrived last year, most with their families. Unicef say there is a desperate need for more safe routes to resettlement.Every night those families in France who can, try to cross the Channel. On Thursday morning a group of around 80 people got into a boat.  spoke by phone to a Turkish academic who was with them.“We didn’t want to get in this boat but the smugglers forced us. It was terrifying, we only got a short way from shore and a wash hit us. One child went overboard but we got them back. We screamed for help but nobody came,” he said.The families made it back to shore where they walked, without shoes and dripping wet, until a charity found them and took them back to find them somewhere to sleep.Lira (not her real name) said that would end her attempts to cross the Channel by boat. “I will never do this again. I will have to find another way.”The children had already recovered from the trauma, she said. “They are children, so they are cheerful again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c783c75c2dcef53edb4d40a58ecf671692387d1f/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0915f2dc58825366075935e9a38e9524","title":"blind date olivia jeremy","story":"What were you hoping for?To meet someone like-minded to hopefully grow a relationship with.

Experts share their advice for all agesUncertainty, confusion, fear: we’ve known all these and more, in bucketloads, since March. But how have our children fared? What are the long-term effects of Covid-19 on them, and how can we help them navigate it all, whatever their age?According to the experts, kids are resilient, and while we won’t know for a long time how affected they’ve been by the pandemic, they are wired to cope. However, children who have already experienced difficulties, especially mental health issues, are at particular risk. Just as important is your own mental health, which will have a huge effect on how your child deals with what’s happening, so don’t forget to look after your own needs, and to seek help – from friends, your GP, a therapist – if you’re finding it tough.Be centred on – and guided by – your child. Each one is different, and each child’s reaction to the pandemic is different. Start with them, rather than with what’s happening out there in the big world. Here’s our stage-by-stage guide.The pandemic hasn’t led to a baby boom, but babies are still being born. Covid-19 will probably mean you’ll want to limit your visitors, and some new parents may well be working from home after parental leave. “It all adds up to a lot more time together, just the three of you (or more if you’ve got older kids),” says NHS midwife Alexandra Walker, who co-runs an antenatal education service called The Naked Midwives. “So there’s not the pressure to have the house tidy for guests, or to have to look good yourself. If you like it that way, do what a pair of new parents we know did last week and put a polite notice on your door to say you’re not available just at the moment. You can capitalise on that time together getting to know the new baby, and not having to listen to lots of well-meaning but often conflicting advice.”You may be worried about the impact on your young baby of not being able to socialise but according to consultant clinical psychologist Emma Citron, that’s unlikely to cause problems. “It’s very important for babies to have contact with people, but it doesn’t matter if they don’t have contact with other babies,” she says. “Developmentally and emotionally, it won’t harm them. What is detrimental to their psychological health, though, is their parents being stressed and under pressure, or shouting at one another because they’ve been cooped up in a flat with no garden.”The same goes for toddlers and pre-schoolers, she says. “The vast majority of very young children will be absolutely fine. Under-twos are extremely resilient and are highly unlikely to have any memories of this time when they’re older. Also, the current reality is all they know. They live in the present, so they can adapt easily to change.”“Let’s face it: it’s not the toddler who desperately needs to see a variety of friendly faces, it’s the parents and siblings, many of whom really suffered because of the isolation of lockdown,” says Justine Roberts, founder and CEO of Mumsnet. So take advantage of the growing opportunities to socialise, albeit carefully, with picnics in the park and meet-ups in outdoor spaces.If you’re overly anxious about the pandemic, your child is undoubtedly going to pick up on that and become anxious in turn – so it’s vital, says Citron, to address your own stress if it’s getting out of hand. “If you’re worrying unduly about the impact of Covid, you need to address that so you’re in a better place for your children,” she says. “Talk to people who can help, and your GP.”Children over the age of three know something very strange has been going on – and they may be worried. Be alert for the signs, which can include sleep disturbances, clinginess, bedwetting, nervous twitches and excessive handwashing. If you see these changes in your child’s behaviour, go out of your way to reassure them.Don’t let fear dominate, Citron says – and let your child lead on any worries rather than imposing your own. “So, for example, don’t spend all the time leaping in with warnings – ‘Don’t touch those railings!’ ‘You’re going too close to that man!’ Instead, say something like, ‘Remember, we’re meant to be keeping social distancing.’ Don’t ramp up the drama, and show that you can get across essential messages while remaining calm and unruffled. That way, children will feel safer and that life is more predictable – and you’ll be signalling that they have permission to ask the questions they want to ask without upsetting you.”Laverne Antrobus, child and educational psychologist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, says it’s important to meet children’s concerns in an age-appropriate way. “When a child asks something, such as, ‘When is the virus going?’, ask first what they know and what they’re worried about,” she says. “You can then address them in the right tone and language, starting from their knowledge.”Being honest with kids, even when you are feeling unsure yourself, is – the experts agree – best. “Children pick up very quickly on parents’ fears, so it’s better to be open about your own anxieties – maybe it doesn’t seem ideal, but there are dangers in letting children live in a happy but unreal bubble,” says David Messer, developmental psychologist and professor of education at the Open University.Antrobus says the pandemic has brought a new level of honesty into family life. “In the past, parents might have said ‘Don’t worry’ to their kids – but the pandemic means they’ve seen their parents worried, it’s put everything on the table.” As with all traumas, it’s a learning opportunity that, in the long term, will boost resilience. “It’s about managing the setbacks and knocks and showing children how to use them to become stronger – and that doesn’t mean airbrushing them out, or pretending they’re not there, it means being clear about the fact that we’ve all been worried, that the virus is an unknown and in many ways it remains an unknown. But we need to show children that we can survive, even if things go against us in the future. So if there are problems ahead with, for example, a second wave, then, yes, we’ll be disappointed – but we will get through.”You need to say something that conveys that there is a problem, but that it can be overcome and that children aren’t usually at risk. So it could be something like: “I’ve been worried, and lots of other people have been worried. It’s a difficult situation: you might get it, although people of your age often don’t even notice they have it. It’s not a big risk to people of your age or my age the risk is much greater for people of great-grandma’s age. But we will get through it, and that’s why we’re doing all these new things you can see, like people wearing masks.”As things stand, school beckons: in Scotland, pupils are back in mid-August, in Northern Ireland, from the end of August, and in England and Wales from early September. “Schools will have contacted parents with guidance for the great return find time to run through the rules with your child, because some measures will feel strange and may take some getting used to,” says Roberts. “If your child is anxious about change or new situations, try a bit of role play to help them find solutions to scenarios they’re worried about.”It’s a mistake to think all teenagers found our changed lives difficult. “Many of the adolescents I’ve been in touch with have been surprisingly OK with it,” says clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Dave Spellman. “Lockdown gave them the chance to sidestep some of the anxieties and pressures they’re usually up against.”Roberts has noticed the same. “Some older children really enjoyed spending time in a safe bubble at home, and in some cases this interval has revealed just how unhappy they were at school,” she says. If that chimes with what you feel about your kids, Roberts suggests you look at switching schools or even (if your circumstances allow) continuing with home schooling.Most teenagers are relishing the chance to get out and about again – but not all. “Many young people who are anxious about leaving the house have other difficulties – phobias perhaps, or OCD – and the pandemic has brought them to the surface,” Antrobus says. You need to see the world from their point of view, and help them take small steps towards gaining more confidence – and if necessary, consult a professional.Young people who found friendships difficult before Covid-19 may have found lockdown easy – but emerging back into a social life may be tough. Antrobus says the first thing to do is acknowledge that there may be problems by talking it through and then helping them take the first tentative steps towards rekindling links with their classmates.Whenever school restarts, a big message from the experts is that a lot needs to happen before any academic learning is resumed. “This definitely isn’t going to be about just launching straight into the timetable,” Antrobus cautions. “First, pupils need to reconnect with their teachers – emotionally reconnect, with everyone sharing their experiences and being honest about how the pandemic has affected their lives.”Resist the temptation to police how your teens follow the regulations, Citron says. “You’ve got to let them get out and about, and on with normal life, as much as possible,” she says. Better than trying to force them into doing things your way is to say to them: “This is the choice I would make, but I’m not going to tell you what to do. I’m trusting you to follow the guidelines.”Youngsters for whom Covid has coincided with a key crossroads moment have had a lot to deal with: the end of school life for my 18-year-old daughter came when she went out for lunch one day in March and returned to find a teacher at the gate telling her and her friends they couldn’t go back in. Exams, proms, parties, first forays abroad with friends and (for older students) graduation ceremonies and the first step on to the work ladder have all, for the moment anyway, been cancelled. In their place, uncertainty: will they be starting uni in the autumn? Will they ever get a job?“They’re all going to have been affected to some degree – but to what extent may be unclear for some time,” Spellman says. As with the adult population, those who were already up against it with mental or physical health problems are likely to suffer most. “Trust your instincts,” says Roxane Caplan of children’s mental health charity Young Minds. “If you’re worried about how your child is coping, reach out for help to us, your GP, or other NHS services.” Young Minds’ research suggests older teenagers have struggled especially with loneliness, a loss of purpose and a lack of motivation. Caplan’s advice is to keep as much routine as possible in their lives – family mealtimes, for example, can be helpful – and to make space for doing fun things together. “Think of things in the future that you can all look forward to together,” she says. “Point out that the rules won’t be here for ever, and they’re not some kind of punishment, they’re to keep everyone safe.”She recommends encouraging young adults to share what they feel about the current situation. If they don’t seem keen to talk, make sure you’re giving them space to do it on their terms andor try some conversation starters: “Do you have worries about going back to schoolstarting universitytransitioning back to ‘normal life’?” “How do you feel about things changing?” “What makes you feel calm?” “Is there anything you want to talk about?”“Give them space to express what they are feeling,” Caplan says, “and be willing to open up yourself. Remember you don’t need to have answers – no one does. But we all feel calmer, and happier, if we have a chance to talk about our feelings.”Whatever age your kids, model a healthy attitude to self-care. “Lockdown meant parents had to give and give and give, with all sorts of additional pressures,” says Poppy O’Neill, whose new book 101 Tips To Help Your Anxious Child has just been published. “Now it’s time to set a good example and show you’re looking after yourself.” Schedule in times that are about fun, play and connecting – with them, with other adults, and with yourself.Lockdown brought silver linings, and you might want to hang on to some of them. “We had Lego Mondays where everyone stayed in their pyjamas and played with Lego all day, and they were a huge success,” O’Neill says. “And daily walks together are something else we’re going to keep up.” The truth is that parenting in a pandemic isn’t straightforwardly good or bad, easy or tough. For every frustration, there’s a liberation for every challenge, there’s a blessing. Be open to the positives – and remember that better times will come.

Recent graduates will see even more added to the sum they owe.It also comes against the backdrop of the A-level furore that has left thousands of students wondering whether they have the grades to get into university, and whether they can afford it, given that part-time work will be hard to come by for the foreseeable future.A student in England on a typical three-year course with fees of £9,250 a year and a £6,378 a year maintenance loan can expect to graduate with £46,884 of debt – before any cumulative interest is added.Campaigners have long called on the student loan scheme to be replaced with something fairer. In 2017, one of Theresa May’s former chiefs of staff described student loans as an “ultimately pointless Ponzi scheme”.The Department for Education said: “We want everyone with the talent and potential to benefit from a university education, which is why loans are available to all students regardless of background or financial history. Changes to interest rates will have no impact on monthly repayments because these are based on income, not the interest rate or amount borrowed.”Helen Saxon, the banking editor at MoneySavingExpert, said: “While an interest rate rise may seem unfair and unwarranted when so many are struggling with their finances due to the coronavirus, it’s not actually as bad as it seems. Most people will never fully repay their student loan before it gets wiped after around 30 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df4eb6c343aeeec9dc0ffba8f78bd0a7f41f7122/1039_242_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13de2893da82b519cd92585aa1c77b8a","title":"ethical phone maker covid fairphone","story":"As Covid puts a focus on where spending goes, Fairphone wants us to consider people and planetWith the pressures on society and the world thrown back into the spotlight by Covid-19, now is the time to readdress where and how we spend our money to do so in a way that is better for all, not only ourselves.That means trying to buy as ethically and sustainably as possible, which for consumer technology covers both the materials pulled out of the ground and the way the products are made.One company stands above all others as a pioneer of ethical electronics, the eponymous maker of the Fairphone 3 – the most ethical and repairable smartphone you can buy.To find out more, we talked to Fairphone’s design lead, Miquel Ballester, about why an ethical phone is needed, what the firm’s goals are and the progress made over the last seven years.“Founded in Amsterdam in 2013, Fairphone makes an ethical smartphone. It started with the very big goal of changing the industry from within. It creates scalable projects and aims to motivate the whole industry to take action on social and environmental issues in the electronics supply chain.”“It wants to transform electronics into an industry where taking care of people and the planet is a natural part of doing business.”“There’s also a human cost. From the mines to the factories, the entire electronics supply chain is tainted by unsafe and inhumane working conditions, from long working hours to even child labour.”“By creating a smartphone ourselves, we can open up the supply chain, find out where the materials come from and can use commercial strategies to maximise our social impact at every stage.“Four areas in which we are creating change: long-lasting design, fair materials, good working conditions and recycling. In each area, we are pioneering step-by-step change in our products and our own supply chain.” “For companies to be fair, they must truly want to do it. For Fairphone, it is a natural way of doing business. In 2019 a total of 230 workers in our Chinese factory received a bonus of up to €425 (£384) per person – one-and-a-half times the local monthly salary. This type of bonus was a first for our industry.“Almost 8,000 people directly benefited from Fairphone’s social, environmental and economic interventions in 2019. “We encourage consumers to keep their phones for as long as possible – the most sustainable phone is the one you already have. The longer you keep your phone, the lower the carbon footprint. But if you are looking to buy a new phone, consider the Fairphone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d539120647280172adba44c63b08b04a8ae10d3a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2697411df4ae99fb011b8a940c4a64","title":"spend cash ethically coronavirus money","story":"Coronavirus has made us all think about where our money is going.

Arguably one of the most ambitious attempts yet, Loop – already established in the US and France – is undergoing a trial in the UK. Launched by the recycling giant TerraCycle in partnership with Tesco, it is backed by major consumer goods companies such as Unilever and PepsiCo, who have created refill versions of popular brands – including Coca-Cola, Heinz and Persil – to sell via the website. Customers can place online orders for goods that normally come in single-use plastic packaging. These are delivered instead in refillable containers that can be collected from the doorstep and cleaned for reuse up to 100 times.Prices are comparable to the equivalent plastic container – slightly more for the own-brand Nevoli range for pasta and olive oil, etc – but with returnable deposits for the refillable containers.• Using vegan-friendly refillable liquid concentrate and a “circular economy” model, Splosh is a range of laundry detergents, fabric conditioners, washing up liquids, dishwasher tablets, kitchen cleaners and handwashes – all using highly concentrated refillable liquid delivered through the post. Customers can use their own bottles or order them (filled) from the company. The pouches containing refills are recycled and made into useful products such as scrapers and ice-cream scoops when they are returned by customers for free.The company is launching gift vouchers later this month, so parents may want to give it to their kids who are away at university, etc. A £10 voucher buys £15 worth of products.A subscriber to Splosh can buy its value kitchen cleaner for only 18p per 100ml.

It was the first UK beer company to become a B Corporation.• Tony’s Chocolonely is a chocolate brand that claims to be on a mission to stamp out slavery in the chocolate industry, launched in the UK last year and now on sale in major supermarkets. It was the brainchild of the former broadcast journalist Teun van de Keuken (Tony), who discovered the scale of the cocoa industry’s child slavery problem when making a documentary and to raise awareness attempted to get himself arrested for eating “slave-made” chocolate. It is now the market leader in the Netherlands and selling strongly in the UK, with numerous flavour combinations, including dark meringue cherry. Since 5 August it is temporarily not shipping from abroad because of the hot weather, which may affect stock levels.• Oxfam sells a range of coffee, chocolate and tea in its stores and online from suppliers who support the communities they buy ingredients from, including Divine and Cafédirect. This is part of its Source By Oxfam range of brand new products from ethical producers. The range also includes beauty products, cotton bags and jewellery and the charity has just added face masks. These are £3.99, plus delivery, with the money going to craftspeople in Asia who have lost they jobs because of the Covid-19 lockdowns in their country.• Plastic plant pots are the scourge of the horticultural industry: most are hard to recycle as the scanning machines cannot pick up black plastic for sorting. There are alternatives, though, and the Hairy Pot Plant Company has turned to coir pots to sell its range of herbs and herbaceous plants. These are delivered to garden centres (the chains Hillier, Haskins and Notcutts are all stockists) in returnable wooden boxes and the plants are grown in peat-free compost.The so-called “hairy” pots are made from coir, a byproduct of the coconut industry. They will last up to 12 months above ground and plants grown this way can be planted directly into the ground without being taken out of their pot. Coir has to be imported from tropical countries such as Sri Lanka, so it is not without a carbon footprint, but it is still a vast improvement on single-use plastic.The Burford Garden Company stocks a range of hairy pot herbs for £5 each. • If you are looking for unusual crops to raise, the Agroforestry Research Trust sells a mind-boggling range of plants: ideal if you have cottoned on to the delights of growing your own food during lockdown.The trust is a charity focusing on research and education about forest gardening an eco-friendly, low-maintenance way of growing that focuses on perennial plants, so no need to worry about sowing seeds every spring. From dozens of different perennial onions to unusual trees such as Chinese dates and pecans, you will find something interesting to grow.The trust is a carbon negative operation, storing more carbon on its three sites in Devon than it makes from all its activities. Plants sell like hot cakes, so even though they won’t be despatched until autumn or winter, it is wise to order now.• Not all cabbages are created equal: Real Seeds is a family-run seed firm based in Wales that specialises in open-pollinated, non-hybrid vegetable seed, which means you can save seed from anything you grow. It may seem like an act of self-sabotage for a seed company to provide seed-saving instructions with every order but the owners, Ben Gabel and Kate McEvoy, are passionate about teaching everyone these often-overlooked horticultural skills.The packets are generously sized and reasonably priced and the range of varieties is wonderful, from oriental greens for salads and cooking to heirloom beans. There is still plenty of time to get started – check their summer sowing guide to find out what you can sow this month. • The campaign to ban peat from compost mixes gathers pace – and rightly so: the destruction of peat bogs in the UK and beyond is an environmental calamity. But finding good peat-free compost can be hit and miss, which puts many gardeners off trying it. Dalefoot Compost’s range of peat-free compost mixes are superb quality and the price reflects that: you will pay £15.99 for a 40-litre bag of their original Lakeland Gold compost, which is for top dressing and mulching. Yes, you can buy much cheaper elsewhere but Lakeland Gold contains enough slow-release feed to last two years, so you won’t need to renew it after one season.Dalefoot makes its compost mixes from bracken and adds sheep wool: both raw materials sourced from the fells around their farm in the Lake District. Their work to help restore peat bogs is to be commended and they are a living wage employer. A safer bet is to opt for energy suppliers whose green credentials match what customers would expect from a renewable electricity tariff. These include Ecotricity, Good Energy and Octopus Energy, which invest directly in renewable energy projects. A new renewable electricity tariff from Co-op Energy, known as Community Power, is powered entirely by community wind and solar projects from across the country.• Next time you need a key cut, a shoe repaired, some dry cleaning – or even some photos printed out – Timpson should be your destination – if you favour firms that tend to look after their staff.Staff at the 2,000-plus chain are always called colleagues, get extra days off for birthdays, bereavements and a child’s first day at school.

The world needs underpants, so thank goodness for the burgeoning ethical knickers scene, within which You Underwear ticks a lot of feelgood boxes. You Underwear’s simple, stylish pants are made from organic GOTS-certified Fairtrade cotton and produced by a certified ethical and sustainable manufacturer in India, using responsible low-impact dyes. They come in a reusable organic cotton bag and packaging contains no single-use plastic.The company is dedicated to ethical marketing, too, using “real” people as models and has pledged never to photoshop imagery. For every pair of pants purchased, You Underwear donates two pairs to Smalls for All, a charity that provides underwear to women and children living in poverty in the UK and across Africa. Bralettes cost £28, boy shorts £15, bikini bottoms £12, while a thong is £10. That puts You Underwear at the upper mid-end of high street prices (a H\u0026ampM bra top is £12.99 the mid-priced \u0026amp Other Stories soft bra is £27, with matching briefs at £15), which may feel like a price worth paying for ethical, well-made pants.• Thrift+ is a kind of online aggregate charity shopselling excellent-value secondhand high street clothing (a Topshop dress for £7, a Hobbs blouse for £8.50) as well as preloved mid-priced items (an Arket jumper for £24) and designer fare (a pair of Prada loafers for £90).Donating is a smooth process: you send in a bag of clothes for the company to photograph and list, and nominate a charity to receive a proportion of the proceeds. Buying is simple, too: you can filter by size, price or brand and clothes are returnable, which is a rarity when buying second hand online.• Birdsong sells itself as the antidote to fast fashion, producing wilfully trend-free designs. In contrast to opaque, multinational fast fashion supply chains, workers are Londoners facing barriers to work, including adults with learning disabilities to refugees, all of whom are paid a living London wage.Fabrics are sustainable, including the environmentally responsible Tencel and reclaimed textiles sourced by the charity Traid. Birdsong also works with a pensioners’ knitting community group in Enfield, whose members have elected to donate revenue from their items to charity.Paying a London living wage isn’t cheap, so the clothes can’t be either, but sit in the Ted BakerArketKaren Millen end of the high street bracket. An organic T-shirt embroidered with the legend Still European, for example, will set you back £36, a crochet bag hand-knitted from recycled denim wool is £45 while, a maxi wrap dress in reclaimed silk fabric, sewn by a group of women at the Stitches In Time community arts charity in Limehouse, is £165. That’s a special occasion dress that compares with Karen Millen’s Print Shirt Maxi Dress at £131.40 (reduced from £219).By Miles Brignall, Jillian Ambrose, Rebecca Smithers,  fashion editor Hannah Marriott, freelance gardens writer and podcaster Jane Perrone, Joanna Partridge, Samuel Gibbs, Patrick Collinson, Alex Mistlin and Hilary OsborneEthical Consumer magazine is a great place to research anything you are buying – it has more than 125 product guides rating the ethics of different brands on a range of issues including climate impact and human rights. We asked the magazine’s news and features editor, Clare Carlile, for five ways you can change your shopping habits:1. Spend less – and put the savings into an ethical bank account. It may seem obvious but asking “do I really need this” and reducing your consumption is the most direct way to reduce your environmental impact. By putting the savings made into an ethical bank, you can ensure that your money isn’t inadvertently funding fossil fuels or nuclear weapons, too.2. Boycott unethical companies. It often costs nothing to avoid the worst offenders. Ethical Consumer has a boycott call against Amazon for its tax arrangements. The company has also been widely criticised for working conditions, including failing to provide safe conditions for its warehouse workers during the coronavirus crisis and firing employees in the US who have spoken out during the pandemic. 3. Buy secondhand tech and clothing. Each new phone or computer requires a plethora of natural resources, from conflict minerals to petrochemicals. Similarly, clothing is often manufactured with water-hungry cotton or petrochemical-based plastics. It is easy to instead buy refurbished tech online and secondhand clothes through swap shops, charity shops or online. 4. Change the way you travel. Running a car costs more than £3,000 and emits about 4.6 tonnes of CO2 on average per year. That is equivalent to almost six return flights from London to New York. Riding an electric or normal bike can hugely reduce your outgoings and climate impacts. By joining a carsharing club or using a carpool site such as BlaBlaCar, you can make more occasional journeys by car when you need to.5. Go vegan or reduce your meat or dairy consumption. Tofu, lentils and black-eyed beans are all cheaper per 100g of protein than diced beef, a relatively cheap cut of meat. They are also much less carbon intensive: someone who eats a lot of meat will have two and a half times the dietary carbon footprint of someone who is vegan. If you ensure you have a balanced diet and keep up your levels of vitamin B12, going vegan can be a way to address your animal rights as well as environmental impacts.And there is good reason to keep supporting local stores when you can. They are unlikely to have complex tax arrangements or to move profits overseas, and owners and staff will probably live nearby, so more money is likely to stay in your local economy. Shopping locally also means you are less likely to use a car, which is good for the environment.It is hard to find up-to-date estimates of the economic impact of shopping locally, but research done several years ago by the Federation of Small Businesses found that for every £1 spent with a small or medium-sized business, 63p went back into spending in the area. This compared with 40p in every £1 spent with larger businesses.Prices can be as good, if not better, than the supermarkets on some products. Small businesses can be nimble and take advantage of good deals from their suppliers. If they specialise in any particular item, they may have a much larger range than chain stores carry, and offer goods at a wide range of price points. And if they don’t have what you want you can always ask – they may be able to get it in and save you a delivery charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf549668274d09fac3ff008fbb59719e3053730/0_0_3739_2244/master/3739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24c34a244281d044b1609927313742f5","title":"the terrible plight of music event staff coronavirus pandemic","story":"The pandemic has shut down concert tours – and with them go thousands of jobs in sound, lighting, catering and more. As the industry lobbies the government, road crews tell their storiesEdd Sedgwick is a sound engineer and tour manager who normally works for the Vaccines, but with that group having long planned to take 2020 off, he was preparing to go on the road with Radiohead’s Ed O’Brien. Then, as the coronavirus crisis worsened, he got a call: “Put everything on hold for the rest of the year.” Sedgwick’s life emptied out. “The weirdest thing is knowing every day by its date or the day of the week – so you call a day ‘Monday’ instead of ‘Barcelona’ or ‘Milan’.”You can apply Sedgwick’s experience across the live music industry: thousands of workers suddenly learned their working year had ended in March. Tre Stead, for example, is Frank Turner’s tour manager. She was in the last week of Turner’s European tour when the world began to fall apart. They plugged on until Donald Trump intervened, with three shows left. “We had three Americans on the crew, and then Trump did his travel ban.” Faced with the prospect of being stranded in Europe indefinitely, the Americans – with Turner’s blessing – flew home. “And that’s when Frank decided it was the end.”The vast majority of road crew – a broad designation that includes tour managers, instrument technicians, sound engineers, lighting engineers, bus drivers, merchandise sellers and even caterers, plus those working in the other ancillary industries on which touring depends – are self-employed. They go out on tour and are paid for that tour by the artist. When there is no work, there is no money. Since March, those who are self-employed have had to rely on grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), savings, universal credit, or on getting other jobs. The luckier ones – who had set themselves up as limited companies, with themselves as directors – have been able to go on furlough, but times are beyond tough: there is an existential crisis in the road crew world.Though the plight of musicians and venues has been widely publicised, the travails of the live industry’s backroom staff have been less noted. Hence last Tuesday’s Red Alert initiative, where venues across the country were floodlit red as part of the #WeMakeEvents campaign. The aim is to pressure the government to offer more support for the live events business, which was the first industry to close when Covid-19 arrived and is one of the last to reopen. In July, Boris Johnson announced gig venues could reopen with social distancing from 1 August, but reversed the decision with one day to go. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has announced reopening can begin today, but with social distancing in place, it won’t be viable for many venues.Those in the industry say the crisis will get worse without government help. It’s not just iniduals but companies at risk, says Andy Lenthall, general manager of the Production Services Association. “Those are the companies that need to be there to serve the sector – if they fold, they will be left with big warehouses full of lights, or PA systems, owned by a bank.”But it’s the inidual tales that hit hardest. “We basically trawled the internet looking for temporary jobs for our members,” Lenthall says. “Our website has a Covid section with temporary vacancies, and some top technicians have got themselves into Amazon fulfilment centres, or driving for Asda. We had two members bump into each other in the same aisle in Tesco, stacking shelves on a night shift.”Those are the lucky ones. For comparison, try 29-year-old lighting director Chris Yeomans, who was due to spend most of this year on the road with McFly, after finishing a tour with Mabel in March. “I’m back at my parents’ house,” he says. “The only income I have is universal credit, and the government grant for the self-employed.” Or Kirstie Hopper, a tour and merchandise manager, whose last tour was with Halsey. She too is back at home on universal credit. “I’d moved out of home several years ago,” she says. “Now I feel like I’m failing at life. I’m trying to remind myself it’s temporary.”Others have turned their enforced idleness to productive use. Matt Cox, keyboards technician for the Chemical Brothers, has created a website for socially distanced musicians who are having equipment difficulties. Tre Stead has been working at Manchester’s Nightingale Hospital. “I started off doing the night shift in the catering department, from 8pm to 6am, which was pretty brutal. It’s made the time go quickly, but the problem is, being on crew isn’t something you can practise at home. If I go back to work next year – my next booked gig is in May 2021, but it’s not certain that will go ahead – I have to jump on that and know what to do after a year of not doing it.”For American road crews, the situation is even harder, with the benefits system tougher and the need for health insurance to get medical treatment. Tiffany Hendren, for example, found herself caught in a perfect storm by Covid-19. She splits her work – part of the year on staff as a sound engineer for a group of venues in St Louis, Missouri part of the year touring as a freelancer. “In the past I’ve had insurance through the job, but I have to work a certain number of hours for that employer every year to get it. Last year I fell short, so my insurance expired.”That would be bad enough at the best of times, worse in a pandemic, and even worse if, like Hendren, you are asthmatic, suffer from chronic bronchitis and are prone to regular bouts of pneumonia. “That has made me incredibly paranoid about going outside. I’m going slightly mad.”What worries everyone is whether they will have jobs to go back to, and if they do, whether they will be able to afford to return to them. “There are people saying, ‘I’m not up for this any more,’” says Ben Bowers, a guitar tech for Rival Sons. “I’ve spent a lot of time in the studio working on demos for other bands, and I think I’ll find it hard to return.” Every tech person I speak to reports friends who are leaving the business for good, and predicts a crew shortage next year.Those who plan to return to the road know everything will be different, and harder. Major promoters have told me they expect consumer confidence in live music to be so low they will have to cut ticket prices, which will mean lower artist fees and thus either fewer crew or lower crew wages crew members expect the return of live music to be accompanied by freelancers desperate for work undercutting each others’ rates. Edd Sedgwick notes that with supply companies – the ones who provide lights and PA and backline and so on – having had to make redundancies, “they won’t have the stock to set it all back up.” He mentions a tour bus company he uses, which right before Covid had invested in a fleet of brand new coaches. “Now they’re just sitting in a yard.” His conclusion is bleak: “The demand will be there, but I don’t think the resources will be there to support it.”So spare a thought not just for musicians, but the people who make sure they can take to the stage. “This has been 10 years of building a career and making sacrifices,” Chris Yeomans says. “I’ve sacrificed relationships and friendships and now I’m sat at home playing PlayStation wondering what it was all for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5825f95f92dcc6dd21d712e8ebfd1afcaf1bf4fb/0_343_6576_3946/master/6576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2074d19b3cfffb59e0768857e078e202","title":"it hasnt sank in residents win 60 rent reduction in london council flats","story":"Tenants to pay lower social rents after campaign against corporate landlords at Custom House and Canning Town in NewhamThe London borough of Newham announced this week that “following a series of management issues” 250 properties in the borough, which were leased out by the council to the property management company Mears, would be transferred back into council management.The families, who live in Custom House and Canning Town, have previously told the  that the homes they live in are unsafe and unhealthy, with issues such as crumbling asbestos floors, brown water running from taps, and leaky roofs. Those who had struggled to pay their rent, which they described as “sky high”, had fallen into arrears. Some of these issues were compounded during lockdown.Over the past four years, the families have campaigned – under the banner of People’s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House (Peach) – for social rent and to have repairs completed in a timely manner, staging protests and holding street parties while negotiating with the council.As well as charging social rent, the council will now respond to repair works needed in the homes, which have been used as temporary accommodation to house local homeless households. The residents said the exact rent reduction would depend on each property.Fayha Badi, 40, said the rent reduction would be life-changing for most families in the area. The 40-year-old mother of three, who is studying for a masters in biomedical science, said: “I never imagined I could win like this in the end.” Badi, who currently pays £356 a week for a three-bedroom property, will probably pay around £120 when the council takes back control. With the money she saves, she can finally take her children on holiday for the first time in five years.She added: “It’s all through being part of Peach and meeting all these kind people. When I think of them, I feel safe and confident.”Rokhsana Fiaz, Newham’s mayor, said: “This marks a real victory for the residents who have had historical issues with the management of the property by Mears, which I have been committed to address from the time I was a councillor in Custom House.“Since becoming the mayor of Newham in May 2018, officers have worked tremendously hard with residents to address these issues, by challenging Mears to meet their responsibilities and now we’ve come up with an acceptable solution which causes minimum disruption for tenants.”Mears said it had spent £400,000 annually on repairs to the properties, which were condemned for demolition by Newham council. The company said the rent levels in the blocks were set by the council.Alan Long, executive director of Mears, said: “First and foremost, I am deeply saddened that the residents of Customs House have been the victims of political indecision and electoral promises which could not have been delivered. I hope that Newham will now be able to start the much-needed regeneration of the area to develop the homes needed in their borough.“Whilst we are sad to be leaving our relationship with the tenants, I am thankful that this may be an opportunity for Newham to finally create new homes that the residents of Customs House deserve. Mears believes it has met its contractual obligations to residents and the council over the past nine years and have delivered the best service possible in the circumstances.”The properties will eventually be demolished and replaced as part of the regeneration scheme. The council announced plans that will allow current Mears tenants who have lived in the area for five years and were placed into their homes by the council to receive a secure social rent home. These plans are currently subject to cabinet approval.Boglárka Filler, 39, who lives in a two-bedroom property, said she finally felt hopeful about the future following Newham council’s announcement. “Since I’ve been a member of Peach, it’s helped me avoid a mental breakdown. Without them, I wouldn’t be here. If it wasn’t for Peach, I would not have any hope and I wouldn’t be able to participate in the community at all.” Filler, who has two children, hopes to return to her studies.“I’m still lost for words. It’s what we’ve been working for, it’s what we’ve been fighting for,” said Samantha Napa, 31, who works in the financial sector. “There’s been times where I just thought this is never going to happen, but the fact that it is actually happening, it hasn’t sunk in. It’s overwhelming.”Napa, who has lived in her current temporary accommodation in Custom House for seven years, urged others in a similar situation to come together and organise. “By coming together, by showing that we are united as one, they’ve had to listen to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7059b7fc2d74cdaf63581a66c807f89a9dc3394c/13_578_3762_2258/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bf9248084813913d02573699d8336c4","title":"harlequins sale premiership rugby restart","story":"English rugby is back, albeit with more of a clunk than a bang, but after five long months we must gratefully accept what we are given. Harlequins will not care that the rust from both sides was all too evident, nor that the penalty count kept good pace with the number of errors, and even Eddie Jones might have gone home happy with the mature performance of the home fly-half Marcus Smith.The 21-year-old scored 11 points from the boot but it was shrewd kicking to keep Sale penned in once Harlequins caught the eye in what was otherwise a disappointing spectacle – if the good news is that rugby is back then the better news is that it will surely get better as games come thick and fast over the coming weeks. Indeed, for Harlequins it is now alive with possibility and Sale, as disappointing as they were, will know they will significantly improve in matches to come. “Marcus is brave, he doesn’t shy away from the contact, he has worked hard on his defence in the last two months and he wants to be the best player in the world,” said Harlequins’ head of rugby, Paul Gustard. “He’s unashamed of his desire and ambition.”Diamond, too, acknowledged Smith “showed his class” while also lamenting Sale’s inability to adapt to the new breakdown interpretations, hinting at his frustration at how it was ruled on by referee Luke Pearce. “We didn’t get to grip with the breakdown interpretations, so we’re probably delighted to come away with a bonus point,” he said. “We need some clarity.”Before kick-off all eyes fell on both sets of players – Harlequins, united in taking a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, Sale opting to wear white T-shirts with the message “Rugby Against Racism”. Only four of their XV took a knee – Marland Yarde, Simon Hammersley, Sam Hill and Tom Curry and it was hard not to see that lack of cohesion manifesting itself on the pitch.For Sale, hotly tipped as title challengers in the buildup to the restart, conceded eight penalties in the opening 20 minutes. Smith was on target with the three he opted to shoot at goal and Harlequins – thrashed 48-10 in the reverse fixture – were 9-0 to the good. A knock-on from debutant Manu Tuilagi just before half-time, swiftly followed by a shocking missed penalty from Robert du Preez, only served to underline that Sale were not living up to the hype. Certainly Diamond, all the more audible in the absence of a crowd, did not think so.Byron McGuigan scored a well-worked try in the right-hand corner for Sale five minutes after half-time but a woeful crossfield kick inside his own 22 from Du Preez soon led to Scott Baldwin’s pushover try, Simon Hammersley sent to the sin-bin for infringing in the buildup. Du Preez was hooked immediately. His replacement, AJ MacGinty, pulled Sale back to 16-10 with nine minutes to go but, despite plenty of possession in the closing stages, the try was neither deserved nor forthcoming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b953657bad667b1dcff5429e388257752afd2c6/9_11_991_594/master/991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9edf9aa82446474daca41e58b883cb2e","title":"cecilia braekhus womens boxing katie taylor","story":"The world’s best female boxer, who’s spent most of her career on the margins due to a lack of investment in women, is finally getting her due.

So when the coronavirus pandemic scuttled her scheduled April fight with the American contender Jessica McCaskill, Brækhus was happy to shelter-in-place alongside trainer Abel Sanchez and wait for a new date rather than return to Europe and risk not being allowed back into the US.“Closing the borders, the travel restrictions, all the health warnings,” Brækhus told the  this week. “There was so much going on and everything was so uncertain, so I just said I’m going to stay here. Here I am safe and I’m healthy and I can be outside and I have nature around me. I’m in one of the safest places you can be.”Brækhus, the undisputed welterweight champion who is unbeaten in 36 professional fights, will finally climb through the ropes to defend her WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles against McCaskill on Saturday night in a purpose-built ring on the streets of downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma. Unlike the star-crossed Trump rally that took place a few blocks away in June, no spectators will be present and strict health and safety protocols will be in place. Essentially, it’s a made-for-TV production for Dazn, the upstart subscription streaming service which is broadcasting the fight in the US and abroad.It’s been more than 11 years since Brækhus first became a world title-holder at 147lbs, a preposterously long reign in a sport where a champion’s mental and physical toughness are always being put to question. Since unifying the belts of all four major sanctioning bodies in 2014, she’s been widely regarded as the sport’s pound-for-pound world No 1. Should she win on Saturday as expected, the 38-year-old Norwegian will eclipse the legendary Joe Louis’s record of 25 consecutive successful title defenses. By any metric, she is an all-time great.Yet due to a lack of investment in female fighters by TV networks and promoters, Brækhus has been unknown to all but dedicated boxing fans for most of her Hall of Fame career. Even as Ronda Rousey was lifting women’s mixed martial arts from obscure sideshow derided by UFC president Dana White to headline attraction, offering compelling proof of concept of a woman’s drawing power in a traditionally hyper-masculine space, Brækhus found herself relegated to the margins of a sport where men with résumés similar to hers are routinely among the world’s highest paid athletes.“For a long time there was a stigma against women fighters,” Brækhus said. “It took 100 years for women to be allowed in the Olympics, which is crazy. There’s not enough investment from promoters in talent and the big fights. What is so strange is we saw what the UFC was doing but we couldn’t implement that in boxing. The reason why women worked for them is because they always put the same marketing and promotion behind their women as their men.”There are signs Brækhus’s sport is finally catching up. The introduction of women’s boxing to the Olympic programme for the 2012 London Games has given rise to a wave of female fighters who are already familiar to the public before they turn professional – including Mikaela Mayer, Marlen Esparza and the incandescent Claressa Shields – which has made them more attractive to promoters. None from this class is bigger than Katie Taylor, the Olympic gold medalist from Ireland who has already unified the lightweight championship in the  of 14 pro fights and appears to be the gamest challenger to Brækhus’s pound-for-pound mantle.The delicious prospect of a summit meeting with Taylor, which surely would be the biggest women’s fight ever and could help vault the sport to a new level of mainstream visibility, is why Braekhus last year signed with Eddie Hearn, the Matchroom Sport group managing director who has made a deeper commitment to female fighters than any other promoter today.Yet Braekhus, whose nickname (The First Lady) speaks both to her stately comportment and trailblazing origins, has been around long enough to know that anything even approaching gender equity will only come through a sustained investment.“People always think that one thing or one fight will change women’s boxing, but that’s not the issue,” Brækhus said. “There are a lot of different pieces to the puzzle all working together. Getting women’s boxing into the Olympics became a great platform for talent coming up. Then you have me: I have sold 10,000 tickets and sold pay-per-views and other women have done it too over in Europe. Then you have the #MeToo movement, which gave women all over the world a huge boost. The success of women in the UFC was also a big thing. What Eddie Hearn is doing right now with building a big brand and stable around women’s boxing. All these things working together is what’s bringing it to the next level.“So now we just have to get paid for it, too.”A Colombian-born orphan who was adopted by a Norwegian couple when she was two, Brækhus took up kickboxing against her parents’ wishes as a teenager, stealing away from the family’s fourth-floor flat by shimmying down the fire escape to train in secret at a local gym. She switched over to boxing when she was 21, winning all but five of her 80 amateur bouts and taking gold at the 2005 European championships, before deciding to make a career of it. Since professional boxing was outlawed in Norway, that meant relocating to Germany.“When I started, women with muscles were frowned upon in a lot of places,” Brækhus said. “A girl wasn’t encouraged to do martial arts at all. It was hard to find trainers. I was the only girl in the gym. We weren’t allowed to go to the Olympics. Today, it’s a different world from when I started. It’s just amazing to be a part of what’s happening right now.”An efficient, well-schooled boxer with quick hands, hair-trigger reflexes, fluid upper body movement and impeccable footwork, Brækhus saw off Denmark’s Vinni Skovgaard to capture the vacant WBA and WBC titles in her 11th pro outing. But she showed a fortitude beyond the bounds of technical ability in 2014, when she outpointed Germany’s Jennifer Retzke comfortably despite suffering a triple fracture in her right foot during the third round and limping to the finish line. That same year, three months after defeating the Croatian champion Ivana Habazin to become the first woman to unify all four major title belts in any weight class, Norway’s parliament voted to repeal the country’s 33-year-old ban on professional boxing, clearing the way for the prodigal daughter to fight on home soil.In October 2016, before a rollicking sold-out crowd at the Oslo Spektrum that included Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg, Brækhus delivered a sensational second-round knockout in a rematch with French rival Anne Sophie Mathis, who had offered the stiffest test of the Norwegian’s career in their first encounter four years earlier.Some critics have theorized that female boxers, whose fights generally consist of two-minute rounds, should move to three-minute sessions if they want to be viewed as equal, a line of reasoning that observers of women’s tennis are all too familiar with. But Brækhus rejects the premise as a red herring, insisting it misses the larger point.“We women, we don’t have a problem with going three minutes for rounds,” she said. “That’s not a problem. Women have done three-minute rounds before. The problem is we’re being asked to give more, always just to give up more, to do more. It’s not about the three-minute rounds. It’s like we can never do enough. It can be exhausting.”Rather than hash over hypothetical rule changes, Brækhus prefers to focus on the task at hand.“She’s very hungry,” Brækhus said of McCaskill, a St Louis native who has won three straight since a 2017 defeat to Taylor. “She knows exactly what’s going to happen if she beats me. She’s proven herself against the best win the world. She fought Katie when she was very fresh and new. She’s very hard-working, very dedicated. I’m looking for an easy fight here at all.“And if both me and Katie win our next fights and face each other, it would be the biggest fight in women’s boxing ever, by no comparison. You would have all of England, you would have all of the Nordic countries, it would be followed over here in the States. I would say Madison Square Garden would be a nice place to have a fight like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38c9e11e6bd528325cbe0ab26ded34318dbb5a4/0_180_5496_3297/master/5496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b771280f5ea08b165d1d50dee653dfe","title":"snooker ready to welcome back fans for final after event like no other","story":"Ken Doherty hits back at five-time champion’s attack on lower-ranked players and says the standard has never been higherFrom the automated crowd noise to the swathes of empty seats, nothing about this year’s World Snooker Championship has been normal. Well, almost nothing. Whether Ronnie O’Sullivan or Kyren Wilson is crowned champion on Sunday evening, they will have won a tournament like no other in its 93-year history – especially after Friday’s remarkable pair of deciding-frame thrillers. But despite all the peculiarity hanging over snooker’s flagship event and a sense that the sport has seized upon the opportunity presented to it post-lockdown, one man has again thrust the game into the spotlight like few others seem capable of.Having already suggested snooker players were being treated like “lab rats” in the run-up to the championship, O’Sullivan had courted his share of the headlines. But even by his standards, his claim that he would “have to lose an arm and leg” to fall out of the world’s top 50, saying many at the lower end of the rankings wouldn’t even cope as “half-decent amateurs”, certainly was explosive.Purists will argue that the fact the world No 89, Jamie Clarke, eliminated the world No 4, Mark Allen, proves O’Sullivan wrong. But what about those within the game, who ensured snooker was one of the first sports back playing after lockdown and, this weekend, will be the first to resume with fans in attendance for the final as the halted programme of pilots recommences.“I love Ronnie, but I have to say something about that,” admits the 1997 world champion, Ken Doherty, who is still ranked inside the world’s top 64 and therefore, you could argue, an unintended target of O’Sullivan’s claims. “When he came out with that statement, it irritated me a little bit. He’s a genius on the table and whether he likes it or not, he’s an ambassador for our game he’s our talisman.“But there’s a lot of players around that level of the rankings who would have looked up to Ronnie, maybe even been inspired to pick up a cue by him, and to dismiss them wasn’t right. It’s not fair, and it’s not nice. I can’t sit back and let those claims pass through.”The days of Bill Werbeniuk polishing off pints at the same rate he potted balls and players smoking cigarettes mid-match are long gone snooker is expanding at a rate never seen before, and those within the game feel it has taken its chance to jump into the spotlight as one of the first sports to get back up and running post-lockdown with a series of tour events in June.“I think people were starved, they missed sport and snooker has given them an opportunity in a few different ways,” Doherty explains. “To be the first back on television hopefully put some extra eyeballs on the game, and then for the Crucible to have fans back in before everyone else. I think that’s just a wonderful thing. Everyone from Barry Hearn all the way through the system at World Snooker have been incredible. The sport is hopefully going to benefit from this in the years to come.”But with snooker’s Class of 92 – O’Sullivan, Mark Williams and John Higgins – now all into their mid-40s, O’Sullivan’s belief that those lower down the rankings are barely competent professionals suggests a challenge to maintain this momentum in the years ahead. Doherty, however, disagrees. “The standard has never been higher – even when Ronnie turned professional, it wasn’t this good,” the 50-year-old insists. “It’s always been good at the top of the game. But at the bottom, it’s never been this good.“Look, nobody is as good as Ronnie and people are going to look inferior against him when he’s at his best. But those comments, I feel they were like spitting on the younger lads and making them feel small. As a man who proudly represents this sport, that doesn’t wash with me whatsoever.”World Snooker is attempting to attract more youngsters to the game than ever before too, but in the immediate term there is the boost of a live crowd being able to witness the climax of snooker’s most prestigious tournament this weekend. “We’re in rude health as a sport,” Doherty insists. “We’re trying to get more snooker clubs open and take the game into schools and attract kids who maybe don’t like other sports such as football and rugby.“But anyone who’s watched this championship will hopefully appreciate what a great spectacle it’s been. Whether Ronnie is in the final or not, it will be tremendous. We’ve all missed it as players, and as a pundit, it’s strange being camped at Stockley Park for the coverage rather than being in Sheffield. But letting the crowds back in this weekend is a great reward for the players and everyone who is trying to take this game to the next level. I couldn’t understand Ronnie’s comments, and I think you’ll see these young lads defy him and continue to get better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938f085bd2dcb4e7cfc7164da4bdf11de4643911/0_352_5097_3058/master/5097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dc5be73d05b9fbf7e0b8029bfa315e5","title":"england v pakistan second test day three live","story":"An unpleasant weather forecast via  occasional Chris Stocks, on twitter. “BBC Weather’s Tomasz Schafernaker: ‘It’s not changing for the next few days. On the radar further drizzle is upstream heading straight for Southampton. The weather is stagnant and not moving - I’ve got no good news!’” Uh oh. An idea in from Abhijato Sensarma. “I have seen you be an advocate for using the pink ball under bad light for at least a year now, and I think there is merit to the idea. As I’ve done in the past too, I would like to complement this by saying that a day in Test cricket should be ided into four sessions of 23 overs each instead of three sessions of 30 each. This will allow players to be more refreshed and on top of their game, especially in strenuous weather like the Indian and Australian summers. If we use the pink ball under the lights like you suggest (or even throughout the match), we would be getting more live cricket without burning out the players or kicking up frequent controversies about bad light.”Interesting. So, we use the pink ball in the final 23 under your plan. I’d counter by saying that the objective is to play as many overs as possible with the red ball - the red ball, for mine, makes for better cricket. So, I wouldn’t be hard-and-fast about when the ball needs to change every day. Just that it could change, as required.Perhaps my favourite rainy OBO discussion was during the World Cup last year as India and New Zealand were washed out at Trent Bridge. For reasons that I won’t bore you with, I spent the first hour posting from a gutter out the front shielding my screen from drizzle before getting into the press box, where we spent the next four hours talking about one topic and one topic only: umbrellas in the sky. Now, I don’t want to repeat that - it was done then and done well - but I am obliged to post this email from Michael Keane, who informs me that there has been progress since the last time we talked (indeed, from today’s paper!), with the Irish on the front foot. I’ll hand over to him. And this doesn’t even require drones! “I’ve just been reading about the world’s biggest sports air dome, built by a Slovenian company in the west of Ireland. Every summer we ask, when will we be able to play cricket in the rain? ‘We can put a man on the moon and yet...’ as his odiousness used to say. So if we’re not going to have crowds anyway, surely we can just have a big cricket super dome. Sounds like they constructed it in a week or something!” Thanks for this. For related chat, here’s that OBO from last June.The weather is horrible. Sky just gave us a wideshot and it was very dark, raining and altogether awful. Ali tells me that Broad and Anderson have packed it in for now and have walked back to their hotel rooms. As Ian Ward put it: “yuk.” I’ve recruited some Willie J Healey fans. Good to see. And there’s a link to cricket, I neglected to mention. Felix White, who hosts the brilliant Tailenders with Jimmy Anderson and Greg James, has WJH on his Yala! label. “I hadn’t heard of him before but when I listened I heard George Harrison,” writes Colin Hind. “I mean that as a compliment. Great song and arrangement.” Yep, his debut album was out last week and it’s quite something. Here’s another of his lovely tracks to get your teeth into. “Thanks for the video link,” adds Damien Clarke. “I’m liking that. May I suggest a suitable one for anyone getting jittery about the prospect of limited play today?” Nice one. I’ll pop it on.“Morning from the playground in Didsbury @collinsadam, where I’m sure you’d be if you weren’t putting a shift in today.” All ahead of me, Guy Hornsby! “How ironic that it’s glorious in Manchester this weekend. I’d say this Test could be s draw but with these attacks, anything feels possible, eh. Oh cricket.” Wouldn’t have it any other way. Let’s open the inbox. Alisdair Macdonald Gould is off the mark first, saying nice things. Thank you. “How many candles?” 36 of them. The best gift was a card from baby Winnie (six months yesterday, blimey) with her footprints in paint. “Birthday greetings, Adam.” Thank you, Spencer Robinson. “I’m on day 13 of a two-week hotel quarantine in Penang. I’m awaiting a beautiful sunset ... and keeping everything crossed for some fascinating cricket to get me through these final few hours of what has been a seemingly interminable lockdown.”I really hope we can give you that. The forecast isn’t that bad - I promise. Then again, it wasn’t that bad either yesterday. Light will again be our main challenge.I shouldn’t be that surprised that some people have taken great offence at me describing the 15th of August as the opening day of last year’s Ashes Test. Yes, I know the 14th was a washout - I was there. Chill out. The first day was, therefore, day two. Not too difficult to comprehend an otherwise pleasant reflection, was it? Peter Haining has done me a good turn here, finding the mighty overseas TMS link before I have to google it myself! You’re a good egg - thank you. Here it is.An updated pic form the ground, and another update from Ali Martin now that he’s in the ground at Southampton. “Right, am now set up in the A̶d̶v̶a̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶H̶a̶i̶r̶ ̶S̶t̶u̶d̶i̶o̶ Shane Warne Stand and can confirm that yes, both bad light and mizzle mean we’re probably better off spending the morning watching yesterday’s warm and fuzzy video of Younis and Yasir on loop.” Bad light (always) stops play. Okay, I know it doesn’t, but it certainly has felt that way at times in this truncated Test summer. Jimmy Anderson was talking to the press last night and was fairly grumpy about how it all played out yesterday. Let me put to you a solution I’ve been tossing around for a couple of years. I preface this by saying that I know the OBO can be a tough crowd when it comes to fairly radical reform. But hear me out, in the spirit of trying to find a better way. Now, we know that Test cricket can be played under floodlights. We’ve done it plenty of times since November 2015 during the first day-night match. We have a pink ball (a couple of them) that does the trick in a safe enough fashion. But is it desirable to play with a pink ball all the time? I would argue, no. The best Test cricket is with a red ball in the daylight. By best, I mean when the ball behaves in a way that gives us the contests that we crave. There’s no need to ditch the red. However. And it’s a big however. Why not both? Why not use the red ball all day long until the point where the assessment has been made that it is too dangerous to continue? And let’s not debate that point, by the way: I trust fielders at point and square let who tell us how hard a dark ball is to pick up under floodlights. I digress. What do we do when the red ball is no longer safe? Well, change it up. For the overs that remain between then and the close, give the fielding team a choice of pink balls of comparable age. Maybe they use it for four overs, perhaps 14. Whatever it takes to get those overs in. Then the next day, back to the red. This isn’t completely perfect and, of course, it would mean a trickier time for batsmen having to adjust in the very final stanza of the day. But isn’t cricket always about adjusting to changing conditions? Sure, we don’t want safety to be one of them, but we are dealing with that via the change in ball colour, albeit briefly. How have I gone? Drop me a line. Let’s have a constructive chat while it rains. “I’m two miles from the ground and I have my windscreen wipers on.” The words of our man, Ali Martin, who called to relay the likelihood that it’s going to be another one of those mornings. Sorry. But it doesn’t mean we can’t have fun. You can do so by emailing or tweeting. Or find me on AOL or ICQ or MSN Messenger. Is Friendster still a thing? Will you find my own journal entries on MySpace?Speaking of our team of  cricket writers, while we wait for play, you might enjoy an interview on Geoff Lemon and my Final Word podcast that we’ve re-booted for the weekend: our long discussion with Vic Marks in 2017. We sat down with him at his Perth hotel a few hours after Australia had retained the Ashes. But this chat wasn’t about that Test, rather, his lovely lifelong journey in the game. Welcome to the third day of this second Test between England and Pakistan. The tourists are set to resume at 2239 after just 40.2 overs were possible yesterday not many more than the day before - we’ve essentially lost a day. But not to worry, this pitch is gives the impression that it will spit and seam (and probably spin) throughout, so there should be more than enough time to get a result by Monday.The most interesting portion of the morning session is bound to be the interrogation Mohammad Abbas gives the England’s openers. On the evidence of what we’ve seen, it’s hard to imagine a surface better suited his classy brand medium pace. Rory Burns and Dom Sibley will need to bat exceptionally.For my part, I can’t help but think of this day twelve months ago. Then, it was the first morning of the Lord’s Ashes Test, a stunning day played in front of a packed house. I know, because it was my birthday and I was steering the good ship OBO through the first half of it. Despite the fact that the weather is grim and the crowds are non-existent, it’s lovely to be with you again for this iteration of August 15!

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

Despite the impossibility of either a studio audience being present or the panellists all being in the same room, the BBC was going to persevere with Have I Got News for You?. Ian Hislop, Paul Merton and co would ignore the deathly two seconds of silence during which perfectly presentable quips plunged into the vast, empty chasm of an unstable Zoom connection and press on with their jaunty, topical comedy. This turned out to be toe-curlingly awkward – a graphic illustration of how intrinsic audiences were to the success of certain shows.And yet, as suboptimal as the situation was, really HIGNFY had no choice but to carry on. What else was there? Were the Friday schedules to be filled with yet more out-of-date repeats of Have I Got More News for You? Surely not. Also, weren’t we trying to get our heads round one of the most profound crises of our lifetimes? How were we supposed to process the situation without topical humour? As with many of the dilemmas posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was lose-lose. But was a solution staring us in the face all along?Admittedly, Osman is not proposing the return of canned laughter, but rather a “Bubble Audience” – punters socially distanced within a studio with groups drawn from people already in isolation together. It’s also worth pointing out that Osman himself is among the best arguments against manipulated audience sound – his early evening quizzer House of Games is a perfect example of a show already thriving without a studio audience. Osman is the don of teatime TV urbanity: using sidelong glances to camera and direct addresses to the audience at home to make them feel as if they are participants as well as observers. Like Ant and Dec’s early lockdown shows, House of Games makes use of “crew laughter”, which can feel more convincing than a hyped crowd reaction – the crew are working, not waiting to be entertained, so their amusement feels genuine.But why are we so suspicious of artifice? Much as it came to be seen as a signifier of inauthenticity, the laugh track (or Laff Box as it became known) was a surprisingly sophisticated creation, devised to enhance the viewing experience. Invented in the early 1950s by US engineer Charley Douglass, the device was a 3ft-tall box containing 32 tape reels that could hold 10 laughs each. Tracks could be mixed separately for nuance or played all at once for impact. Laughter could possess distinct character – a roar of surprise, a scattering of sniggers as audience members responded to a joke at different moments. It’s no exaggeration to compare it to a musical instrument. Much as it’s regarded as a cynical ploy for leading a mindless living room audience by the nose, couldn’t the Laff Box alternatively be seen as a versatile creator and enhancer of atmosphere?As the medium of television became established, feelings towards the Laff Box changed. In 1955, David Niven described the laugh track as “the single greatest affront to public intelligence I know of”. But did David Niven ever have to watch a repeat of a 2015 episode of Would I Lie to You? for the fourth time during a global pandemic? He did not. What the Laff Box did ultimately isn’t all that different from the crowd noise used as a sound-bed during lockdown football matches. It orientated viewers who were struggling with a strange new reality.Back in the 1950s, the idea of consuming entertainment at home rather than in a live setting, with all the immediacy and intimacy that implies, must have seemed new and alienating. But aren’t we in a similar situation today? What we’re now consuming is familiarly formatted entertainment but characterised by distance. From TV to gigs to comedy, we’re having to think laterally in search of workarounds – from communal watching using video conferencing technology to social media viewing and listening parties. Why shouldn’t tastefully assembled laughter tracks be a part of that? It seems we’re in this for the long haul. So perhaps we should enjoy something at least vaguely resembling The Before Times. If we can’t cheat now, when can we?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d07ad8d8a29dcda027106f16f7aec262786507d5/0_280_4630_2779/master/4630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=051d3c12b52190679adb6615b27dce6f","title":"us election november votes ballots democracy","story":"There are growing fears over the handling of November’s US presidential election after it emerged that the US Postal Service (USPS) has warned it cannot guarantee mail-in votes will be counted in almost every state in America and Barack Obama accused Donald Trump of trying to “discourage people from voting”.In letters to 46 states, and the District of Columbia, the USPS has warned that it could not guarantee all ballots cast by mail for the November election will arrive in time to be counted – possibly affecting tens of millions of votes across almost the whole country.The news was reported first in the Washington Post.A record number of Americans are expected to vote via the USPS because of concerns over in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far claimed more than 160,000 US lives.One of the letters was sent to Pennsylvania’s top official overseeing elections, warning that a one-week turnaround for mail-in ballots may not be possible.In response to the growing crisis in the USPS Obama – who has generally carefully avoided attacking Trump directly – launched a remarkable broadside against his successor.In a podcast with David Plouffe, his former campaign manager, Obama said: “What we’ve seen in a way that is unique to modern political history is a president who is explicit in trying to discourage people from voting. What we’ve never seen before is a president say, ‘I’m going to try to actively kneecap the postal service to encourage voting and I will be explicit about the reason I’m doing it.’”Obama added: “That’s sort of unheard of.”Voting by mail has become a politically charged issue, with Trump claiming that mail-in ballots will benefit his rival, the Democrat Joe Biden, and lead to fraud. Experts have confirmed that the mail-in ballot system has long been safe from any fraudulent tampering, with Trump and members of his family repeatedly using the methods themselves.Democrats have proposed $3.6bn in election funding to help states with vote processing, with another $25bn for the cash-strapped USPS to help it meet the expected demand from the 180 million voters who are registered to vote.But Trump has explicitly said he opposes these measures as he wants to deter mail-in voting.“If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money,” the president told Fox Business on Thursday. “That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting. They just can’t have it.” Trump also repeated his claim, again with no evidence, that mail-in ballots would be “fraudulent”.Those remarks triggered widespread outrage, especially among Democrats and civil liberties groups.Trump’s critics have accused the president, who is badly trailing Biden in polling, of attempting to stymie the USPS to bolster his floundering re-election effort. Biden said the president’s latest comments were “pure Trump”. The presumptive Democratic nominee, who this week chose the California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, added that Trump “doesn’t want an election”.The mounting concerns over the democratic process have been fueled by an apparent slowdown in activity by the USPS, which is headed by a Trump appointee. The USPS plans to remove hundreds of high-volume mail processing machines across the country, ostensibly due to a reduction in letters and packages sent during the pandemic.Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016, has said that she fears “Republican sabotage of the USPS, including slowing mail delivery, is a Trump strategy to make voting by mail more difficult this fall”. Clinton urged voters to requests ballots early and send them in as soon as possible.The 300,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers said on Friday that the union’s executive council had endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for president, warning “the very survival” of the postal service was at stake.Trump, presiding over a disastrously handled pandemic that has ravaged the health of millions of Americans and plunged the country into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, has attempted to hurry along the reopening of schools and businesses, despite a surge in infections in many states, while attempting to paint Biden and Harris as an existential threat to the US.On Thursday, Trump lent credence to a false and racist conspiracy theory that Harris was not eligible to serve as vice-president, saying that he considered the allegation “very serious”. Harris, who would be the first black and Asian woman to be vice-president, was born in California and is able to serve in the role, or as president, under constitutional requirements.Trump previously aired the same “birther” conspiracy about Obama, the first black US president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f248cba67a2f3713ba9a6d055766aae2007d4ea/0_76_4473_2684/master/4473.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e6c6d8b0ac6b5cf01129a4f0fafff9","title":"iran and turkey denounce uae over deal with israel","story":"‘The move against Palestine is not a step that can be stomached,’ says ErdoğanTurkey has threatened to suspend its diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and recall its envoy, a day after the Gulf state announced it would become the third Arab country to establish full ties with Israel.“The move against Palestine is not a step that can be stomached,” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told reporters on Friday.He said he had told his foreign minister that “we may also take a step in the direction of suspending diplomatic ties with the Abu Dhabi leadership or pulling back our ambassador”.Erdoğan has increasingly styled himself as the Palestinians’ lone regional champion, despite his country having had diplomatic relations with Israel for decades.Thursday’s announcement has ided the region, with Iran also denouncing it as an act of “strategic stupidity from Abu Dhabi and Tel Aviv”. Tehran’s foreign minister described the agreement as a “dagger … unjustly struck by the UAE in the backs of the Palestinian people and all Muslims”.As part of the US-brokered deal, the UAE claimed it won a concession for the Palestinians as Israel agreed to temporarily “suspend” its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank.However, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been clear he remains committed to annexation, and Palestinian leaders slammed the UAE deal as a betrayal that damaged their cause.The new alliance has broken the status quo in which Israel was mostly isolated by its neighbours as a pariah.Jordan, which with Egypt was the only other Arab state to have recognised Israel before Thursday’s announcement, issued a statement acknowledging the deal without praising it.The Jordanian ruler, King Abdullah II, has been a prominent critic of Netanyahu’s plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Amman said more progress on the Palestinian issue was needed.While the Palestinian issue has been sidelined regionally, mutual hostility towards Iran shared by Israel and several Middle East states has been a critical factor in their budding relations in recent years. Meanwhile, Washington has attempted to gather a coalition of Israel and autocratic Arab leaders against Tehran and its allies.Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has said another Arab country is likely to establish ties with Israel in the coming days. Bahrain and Oman, which both welcomed the UAE move, are seen as likely candidates.Trump’s announcement on the UAE appeared to have blindsided the Palestinian leadership and their allies. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, suggested he had no forewarning of it.“The Palestinian leadership rejects and denounces the UAE, Israeli and US trilateral, surprising, announcement,” said his spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adding that it was a betrayal of Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause.Elsewhere the deal has been widely welcomed, in large part because it was interpreted as halting annexation.The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, called the accord “hugely good news”. He said: “It was my profound hope that annexation did not go ahead in the West Bank, and today’s agreement to suspend those plans is a welcome step on the road to a more peaceful Middle East.”Even Trump’s opponent in November’s US election, Joe Biden, said the UAE’s move was “a welcome, brave, and badly needed act of statesmanship” that would help ensure Israel remains an “integral” part of the Middle East.“Annexation would be a body blow to the cause of peace, which is why I oppose it now and would oppose it as president,” Biden said.The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said annexation “would effectively close the door for a renewal of negotiations and destroy the prospect of a viable Palestinian state and the two-state solution”.Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli journalist and author of a Netanyahu biography, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli leader had won a significant diplomatic coup while giving nothing to the Palestinians, previously seen as a requisite for regional acceptance.“It is an achievement for Netanyahu that his predecessors who were prepared to make major concessions to the Palestinians only dreamed of,” he said. “A generation of western diplomats who thought that Israel needs to pay in hard currency for any such breakthrough with the Arab world were tearing their hair out last night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc7354f85eaa7ba9d97abf2c0a7760ee7dca57f/0_67_2635_1582/master/2635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ddb03f037e056dbb593e42028ccc99","title":"us iran un arms embargo nuclear deal","story":"Just one country joins US in vote, highlighting Washington’s isolation as it seeks more drastic action against IranThe US has suffered a humiliating defeat at the United Nations as its proposal to extend an arms embargo on Iran won support from only the Dominican Republic at the security council vote.The US resolution was never likely to be passed in the face of Russian and Chinese opposition. It was proposed as a ploy by the Trump administration to open the way to more drastic action against Iran.But the scale of the defeat on Friday underlined US isolation on the world stage ahead of a major diplomatic confrontation that threatens to consume the security council and further sap its authority.The US stripped anti-Iran rhetoric from earlier drafts of the resolution in the hope of recruiting more supporters, but its insistence that an extension to the UN embargo would be indefinite made that impossible. Estonia and Tunisia withstood eleventh-hour US pressure to support the revised draft, a measure of diminished American clout at the UN. Russia and China voted against the resolution, the US and the Dominican Republic voted in favour, and all the other council members abstained.In his response to the vote, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, lashed out at other member states.“The Security Council’s failure to act decisively in defense of international peace and security is inexcusable,” he said in a statement issued even before the result of the vote had been declared.US officials have said that following the defeat of the arms embargo resolution, they would embark within days on a legally controversial tactic in an effort to restore UN sanctions lifted when Iran signed a nuclear deal with major powers in 2015.The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has a mechanism that allows any of the parties to the agreement to “snap back” UN sanctions on Iran.Trump withdrew the US from the JCPOA in 2018 but US diplomats and lawyers will argue it is still technically a party to the agreement and therefore empowered to snap back sanctions. Most of the rest of the world, including some of Washington’s closest allies, disagrees, but the Trump administration has so far shown itself ready to proceed virtually alone.“The US goal this week has pretty obviously been to table a resolution that will fail, so they’ve got an excuse for going to snapback next week,” Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group. “It’s just a little bit embarrassing that it has failed so badly.”The US special envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, announced his resignation days before the arms embargo resolution at the UN.If the US proceeds with its snapback plan, it could lead to a situation in which there is no agreement on the status of UN arms sanctions, with the US declaring they are in effect and most other countries insisting there are not.“Frankly, we’re soon going to be entering what you could call ‘security council in Wonderland’, by which the US will claim that the snapback train is rolling and others refuse to accept that,” Gowan said. “There will be lots of procedural fights in the council. But basically there will be two realities.”The UK could find itself trapped between those two realities, forced to choose between them. London so far has stuck closely to an agreed European line with France and Germany.“It appears the UK has chosen to put its security relationship with Paris and Berlin ahead of its desire for a Brexit trade deal with the US,” Gowan said.Vladimir Putin has suggested a videoconference summit on Iran, and the Élysée Palace in Paris signaled that Emmanuel Macron was open to the suggestion. Donald Trump said he had heard about the proposal but had not been told the details. Trump and Macron spoke by phone on Friday but the White House account of the call did not mention the proposed summit.Suzanne DiMaggio, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment Institute for Peace, said that the US focus was not on building coalitions on the issue but on provoking a diplomatic confrontation at the UN to please Trump’s core supporters.She said the ultimate US aim was also to try to provoke Iran into a reaction, possibly leaving the JCPOA itself, or even expel international nuclear inspectors.“It is a scorched-earth approach, destroying the JCPOA in order to make it difficult for a Biden administration, and for the Iranians, to return to it,” DiMaggio said. “They’re not concerned with keeping a lid on Iran’s nuclear program. They really want to kill this deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a52fd2dbc271059dee22a9ebce48f045d3eac9b2/0_57_3588_2154/master/3588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56ea07c1715bd14be8f15a725b8402bb","title":"deep remorse japanese emperor marks 75th anniversary of surrender","story":"Naruhito reflects on war actions at Covid-curtailed ceremony, marked elsewhere by former foes as Victory in the Pacific or VJ DayJapan has marked the 75th anniversary of its surrender in the second world war with Emperor Naruhito expressing “deep remorse” over his country’s wartime actions at a sombre annual ceremony curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.Naruhito pledged to reflect on the war’s events and expressed hope that the tragedy would never be repeated. There was no word of apology from the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who gave thanks for the sacrifices of the Japanese war dead.“Reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,” Naruhito said in a short speech at the event in Tokyo marking the 75th anniversary of Japan’s surrender on 15 August 1945.Amid virus fears and worries about the fading memories of the fast-ageing war generation, about 500 participants, reduced from 6,200 last year, mourned the dead with a minute of silence. Masks were required and there was no singing of the Kimigayo national anthem.Naruhito has promised to follow in the footsteps of his father, who devoted his 30-year career to making amends for a war fought in the name of Hirohito, the current emperor’s grandfather.Abe has increasingly sought to whitewash Japan’s brutal past since taking office in December 2012. He has not acknowledged Japan’s wartime hostilities during 15 August speeches, which had previously been a nearly 20-year tradition that began with the 1995 apology of the Socialist party prime minister Tomiichi Murayama.Abe said the peace that Japan enjoys today was built on the sacrifices of those who died in the war. He pledged that Japan would reflect on lessons from history and will not repeat the war devastation. He listed damage inflicted on Japan and its people, including the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, firebombings of Tokyo and the fierce battle of Okinawa.He pledged to play a greater role in tackling global problems. Under his goal of turning Japan into a “beautiful” and “normal” nation, Abe has steadily pushed to cleanse Japan of its embarrassing wartime history and build up its military by stretching the interpretation of Japan’s war-renouncing constitution. It includes acquiring greater missile defence capability in the face of a growing military threat from North Korea and China.Abe stayed away from a Tokyo shrine that honours convicted war criminals among the war dead. He sent a ritual cash, seeking to avoid angering China and South Korea, which consider the Yasukuni shrine a symbol of Japan’s militarism. It honours 2.5 million war dead, mostly Japanese, but among them are senior military and political figures convicted of war crimes.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, offered talks with Japan to resolve their feud over wartime grievances as his country celebrated the 75th anniversary of its liberation from Japanese colonial rule. In a nationally televised speech, Moon said his government had left the door of consultations wide open for Japan to settle a long legal and diplomatic dispute over compensation for Koreans who had been subjected to forced labour.Relations between South Korea and Japan sank to their lowest point in decades in 2019 as they allowed their disagreements over wartime history to spill over into issues related to trade and military cooperation.Moon avoided direct criticism of the conservative government of Abe, which has insisted that all compensation issues were settled when the two countries normalised relations under a 1965 treaty. That stance was rebutted by South Korea’s supreme court in 2018 when it ruled the deal did not cover inidual rights to seek reparations and called on Japanese companies to compensate ageing Korean plaintiffs.“Our government is ready to sit face-to-face with the Japanese government at any time to find a mutual solution the victims can support,” Moon said.Moon also called for North Korea to respond to South Korean proposals for bilateral cooperation, including joint programmes against Covid-19 and other diseases, and the resumption of temporary reunions between ageing relatives separated by the 1950-53 Korean war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e1ae492d06bd281022623da6541d4a58cd8aec/0_310_4647_2788/master/4647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcf357480496974917dca8866a1b5960","title":"new zealand coronavirus seven new cases confirmed","story":"Auckland’s lockdown extended for two weeks start of provincial women’s rugby season delayedNew Zealand reported seven new cases of coronavirus up to Saturday morning after a lockdown in Auckland was extended.Six of the seven new cases were linked to the cluster at the centre of all the previous community cases, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health.Up to Saturday, the authorities in New Zealand have reported 37 cases connected to the outbreak with 19 other people in quarantine.The lockdown in Auckland, home to 1.7 million people, was extended for nearly two weeks after New Zealand reported 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday.The outbreak has delayed the start of the New Zealand women’s provincial rugby competition for at least two weeks.

I’m just really excited to get back to the beauty side of it all now.”Hollywood Bowl said 48 of its 61 centres were reopening on Saturday, with each operating with reduced numbers of lanes, reduced customer capacity, and groups restricted to a maximum of six people.Stephen Burns, the chief executive of Hollywood Bowl Group, said: “It’s a great relief to finally have clarity on when we can reopen after such unexpected and long delays. We’ve been ready to reopen in the fully government approved Covid-secure way for many weeks and our trained teams are eager to get back to work.“Our centres are spacious and well suited for social distancing, and we’ve put in place wide-ranging hygiene and sanitisation measures. ”Grosvenor Casinos, which has a portfolio of 52 casinos across the UK, said it was reopening 35 in England. Coronavirus safety measures include a capacity cap, voluntary PPE and face coverings for guests and staff, screens on gaming tables and machines, hand sanitiser stations and contactless payments.Jonathon Swaine, managing director at Grosvenor Casinos, said: “We’ve been ready to reopen safely for a number of weeks and we are delighted we can now finally welcome back our customers to enjoy our casinos safely once more.”Genting casinos said it would be opening the majority of its casinos on Saturday. A spokesman said: “After weeks of meticulous planning, we are fully confident that our casinos are ready for re-opening. This is what we have been building towards for some time now, and the delays we have experienced have of course been hugely frustrating and damaging to the business. The re-opening is therefore incredibly exciting for all involved and we cannot wait to welcome customers back into our casinos.”The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a rise in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in them being paused for two weeks.The reopening comes as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced tougher fines for people repeatedly not wearing a mask.At present, people who refuse to wear a face covering where it is required face a £100 fine, which can be reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days, but under the new measures, that penalty will double for subsequent offences, up to a maximum of £3,200.A clampdown on illegal gatherings of more than 30 people could result in those responsible being hit with spot fines of up to £10,000, a No 10 source indicated.Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said an estimated 160,000 holidaymakers were expected to try to return to the UK from France on Friday before the new quarantine measures were brought in.Travellers returning to or visiting the UK from France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks \u0026amp Caicos and Aruba after 4am on Saturday will be required to self-isolate for two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57dcf8d9a5dba08212c8a75578eb17683e5bd573/0_122_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ef4b6ab94cf038b7dd01cd597f94f98","title":"the press has to go on hong kong media tycoon jimmy lai defies beijing","story":"Apple Daily founder and pro democracy activist says his case will likely be a ‘litmus test’ of Hong Kong’s legal systemWary but defiant, Jimmy Lai is determined to keep fighting for a democratic Hong Kong, even as he acknowledges that China’s goal is to take full control of the region.Speaking to the  five days after his arrest on foreign collusion allegations – he is currently out on bail - media tycoon Lai argues the press must keep going. But he also believes that Monday’s round up was a warning from Beijing.Six weeks ago the Chinese Communist Party government (CCP) imposed national security laws on Hong Kong which made even the mildest forms of activism a crime against the state. Dozens have since been arrested, including Lai, who owns the unashamedly pro-democracy Apple Daily tabloid.“They just want to show the teeth of the national security law, but they haven’t bitten yet. So let’s see what happens.”Lai believes that he won’t be sent to the mainland for trial, and says his case will likely be a “litmus test” of Hong Kong’s legal system, and whether authorities will keep their promise that Hong Kong’s mini-constitution will be respected.On Monday police officers came to Lai’s home shortly after his morning exercise. They let him shower, but kept the door open. Then he was handcuffed and taken into custody, and the police later walked him through the newsroom of Apple Daily, as officers rifled through reporters’ desks.More than 40 hours later he was released on a hefty bail with no passport, court date, or details of his charges, beyond allegations of colluding with foreign or external forces and conspiracy to defraud.Lai has met with US politicians including vice-president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and has called for sanctions in international interviews, which may be considered collusion if they occurred after 30 June. He has denied using US funds against Beijing, and opposes the push for Hong Kong independence which sits on the fringe of the pro-democracy movement. Nine others were also arrested.Hong Kongers were furious, but the days of two million-strong marches and violent street clashes with police are over, so they got creative. On days when Apple Daily would usually shift 70,000 copies they sold half a million, according to reports. Businesses booked adverts and traders bought his company’s “junk” stock, surging its price.The future of protest in Hong Kong is creativity and patience, according to Lai. “We won’t get what we want in a short time ... We have to be more flexible and cautious and find different ways to persist for the long term, not the short term,” he says.“Time is on our side, time is our weapon. Not violence.”The international community has responded to Beijing’s crackdown by revoking extradition agreements, putting sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials, and – in the UK - giving more than three million HongKongers with British National Overseas passports the right of abode.“This has a tremendous positive effect in Hong Kong,” says Lai.The cliche about Lai, who is also a British citizen, is that he is “Asia’s Rupert Murdoch” - rich, powerful, and passionate about the news. He is a prominent figure of the pro-democracy movement, unafraid to criticise Beijing.He believes the eyes of the world are key to Hong Kong’s safety as long as they don’t look away. He isn’t sure if the hostile language of senior US officials like Mike Pompeo, will be useful in the long term, but says for now China seems to have dialled back its rhetoric.“I think the more the US is involved in Asia, the better it is for everybody here to balance the CCP’s power.”With the raid on Apple Daily, Hong Kong media’s fears became reality. They’d been told the press was still free as long as they don’t break the new law, but no one could say what that looks like.“We don’t know where the red line is, we don’t know where to toe the line,” says Lai. “For us, definitely, we’ll go on to do what we do.”He says he’s not asking his journalists to be martyrs.“What I tell my staff is: when you do your job consider your own safety, your conscience, and your obligation to society.”“We always have to test… the bottom line. So as we go on we might have a few arrests, we might get a few punishments, but life has to go on and the press has to go on.”So what is the movement’s endgame? The promised full democracy they’ve been seeking for years is “impossible” now, says Lai, but they will keep fighting anyway.“Without fighting, we don’t have hope. We don’t know when we’ll win, but we’re so sure we’re on the right side of history, and time is on our side,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6e5088fa389908e0f625b11f18136a3a0157c6/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303be7290a74524ccc2f89da8b261a15","title":"uk to mark 75th anniversary of victory over japan day","story":"VJ Day was declared when emperor Hiroito ordered his people to stop fighting in second world warThe UK marks the 75th anniversary of VJ Day on Saturday, with a national moment of silence and service of remembrance, as well as tributes paid by world leaders.Victory over Japan was declared on 15 August 1945, when the emperor Hirohito addressed his people and told them to stop fighting. The formal surrender of Japanese forces came on 2 September that year, the date traditionally commemorated by the US.The day began with a piper playing Battle’s Over at the Imperial War Museum’s HMS Belfast in London at sunrise, as part of a tribute entitled Waking Up to Peace.Military pipers also played at dawn in India, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was joined by military chiefs as he laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning.Shortly after 10am, the BBC broadcast the Friendship of Nations, which included 10 world leaders paying tribute to all who served.They included the Malawian president, Lazarus Chakwera, the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison.

But this does not mean that the live music scene will be immediately restored.Wearing face masks on public transport will be compulsory in Denmark from 22 August after a spike in new coronavirus cases, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, said today, according to a report by Reuters.In mid-April, Denmark became one the first European countries to ease its coronavirus lockdown as the epidemic appeared to be contained, but the reproduction rate at which it is spreading rose above 1.5 in the past week, the highest reading since early April.Frederiksen said the surge also meant that plans to remove a limit on the size of public gatherings would be deferred, with the limit remaining at 100 people for the time being.Theatres, casinos and bowling alleys are opening today as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England, Jessica Murray and Alex Mistlin report:From Saturday, physically distanced audiences will be allowed back into indoor venues, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will also be permitted.Tattoo studios, beauty salons, spas and hairdressers will all be able to offer additional services, including front-of-face treatments such as eyebrow threading.Danielle Simm, manager of Kolo Hair and Beauty, said she was excited to be starting up beauty treatments, with a huge waiting list of keen customers.Historians will savage Jair Bolsonaro for leading Brazilians into a deadly “canyon” with his shambling, self-interested and anti-scientific response to Covid-19, according to his former health minister.In an interview with the , Luiz Henrique Mandetta accused the Brazilian president of playing a pivotal role in steering Latin America’s largest economy towards a catastrophe. Bolsonaro played politics with citizens’ lives at a time of global crisis, he said, as Brazil’s death toll rose to more than 105,000. Only the US has suffered more deaths.Mandetta, who has hinted he will challenge Bolsonaro for the presidency in 2022, became a household name in the early stages of the pandemic. He drew praise from the left and the right for his accessible, science-based alerts over the threat of coronavirus during daily press conferences.A 55-year-old orthopaedic doctor, Mandetta was elected to congress in 2010 and has faced criticism for opposing the Mais Médicos (More Doctors) health scheme that sent Cuban doctors to remote and deprived parts of Brazil. He was named health minister in November 2018, shortly after Bolsonaro’s surprise victory.But he was sacked in mid-April after publicly challenging Bolsonaro’s sabotaging of physical distancing. Speaking from his base in the midwestern city of Campo Grande, he said the two had not spoken since.Businesses welcome customers back through their doors today as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England.Businesses have said they are delighted to be welcoming customers back through their doors on Saturday as part of the latest easing of lockdown restrictions in England.It comes after the prime minister announced that fines for repeatedly refusing to wear a mask could soar to £3,200 and organisers of illegal raves could face a £10,000 penalty.Casinos and bowling alleys are among the venues now allowed to reopen under the latest guidance. Physically distanced audiences are also now allowed back into theatres and other indoor venues, while wedding receptions of up to 30 people will be permitted.The move to allow indoor performances follows a “successful series of pilots”, Downing Street said.Tattoo studios, beauty salons, spas and hairdressers can now offer additional services, including front-of-face treatments such as eyebrow threading.The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a spike in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in a pause for two weeks.A spike in new coronavirus cases in South Korea has prompted authorities to reimpose tighter physical distancing regulations in Seoul, but that didn’t stop thousands of demonstrators from protesting against President Moon Jae-in’s policies.For the second day in a row in over four months, the country has reported a sudden jump in locally transmitted cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.The KCDC reported 166 new cases as of Friday, of which 155 were domestic, prompting authorities to reintroduce antivirus measures as they worried about the spectre of a fresh wave of the disease.The tougher rules come as thousands staged demonstrations in downtown Seoul, despite a ban on rallies in the capital city, with some conservative groups protesting against Moon’s recent real estate market policy and a series of sex scandals involving leaders of his administration.Russia has started manufacturing its new vaccine for Covid-19, the Interfax news agency reported on Saturday, citing the health ministry.Russia has said the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute and the first for coronavirus to go into production, will be rolled out by the end of this month. Scientists said they feared Moscow might be putting national prestige before safety.Russia has reported 5,061 new coronavirus cases and 119 deaths in the past 24 hours, compared with 5,065 new cases and 114 deaths on Friday.Hi, I’m Aamna Mohdin and I’ll be taking over the liveblog for the rest of the day.

Photograph: CollinsProposals for the permanent pedestrianisation of several streets around Grafton Street have had an “overwhelmingly positive” response following trials in recent weeks, Dublin City Council has said.For the last three weekends, parts of South William Street, Drury Street, Dame Court, South Anne Street and Duke Street have been pedestrianised, with parking spaces turned into outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants.This weekend was to be the last weekend of the trial scheme, but the council said the scheme will continue for the remaining two weekends in August. There was clear desire for the measures to be made permanent, it added.“We have received 1,010 responses to our online survey on the trials and feedback remains overwhelmingly positive with over 90 per cent of respondents in favour of pedestrianising these streets on a permanent basis.”Footfall on Grafton Street and the surrounding area had fallen to 20 per cent of normal levels during the coronavirus lockdown. However, following the introduction of the pedestrianisation, footfall on the August bank holiday Saturday was higher this year than for the same Saturday in 2019, the council said.From this week, parking spaces in several locations will be retained for tables and chairs on a seven-day basis, the council said.Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon said the reaction from businesses and the public to the trial was conclusive.“The principle of pedestrianisation of these streets has been settled without question,” he said.Some issues such as access for cyclists needed to be ironed out, but it was clear people found coming into town a “nicer experience” at the weekends. His fellow Green Party councillor Janet Horner said the trials had been invaluable in allaying any fears in relation to the pedestrianisation.To facilitate safe cycling routes to schools the council is also installing a 3.5km segregated cycle lane along Griffith Avenue from Ballygall Road in Glasnevin to Malahide Road in Marino.The route will act as a “main spine”, the council said, with extensions either side introduced over time to enable safe cycling to schools and colleges in the area, which includes Dublin City University. The route will include a contraflow cycle lane on the one-way section of Griffith Avenue at the Ballymun Road.Contraflow cycle lanes will also be installed in the city centre on Parnell Square East, to link O’Connell Street to North Frederick Street, and on Werburgh Street in Christchurch.Meanwhile, design work is continuing on the two-way cycle track for Strand Road in Sandymount, which will see the coastal road become one-way for cars."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Brian FarrellAn 85-year-old Carrick-on-Shannon woman says she is traumatised after learning from “a person on the street” that Leitrim County Council intends to demolish her home and business on the Main Street, to make way for a “destination centre”.Kathleen Geraghty, who has run a shop in the centre of the town for 65 years, says she was never consulted about the proposal which would require the demolition of three buildings that are part of the original streetscape.An artist’s impression of the council’s plan, which the local authority described as a “concept proposal”, shows a glass structure spread over the three properties that are opposite St Mary’s Catholic Church.The Geraghty family – who are “disgusted and devastated” over how the council has handled the project – say thousands of people have signed a petition opposing it, including almost 3,700 online.Local Fine Gael Cllr Finola Armstrong Maguire, who owns one of the three buildings involved, and runs The Magnet drapery store from there, said she had agreed to the “concept”. She said she did have concerns about the proposed building but believed there was “room for compromise”, such as having parts of the existing buildings incorporated into the new structure. The council has said that as a centre for artisan and originally-designed goods in the centre of the town, it would be a significant draw.“My bottom line is that I believe that health and education must be our priorities in the current circumstances”, added Cllr Armstrong Maguire, who questioned whether finance would be available for such an ambitious project.‘Traumatised’Mrs Geraghty, whose late husband Pat bought their building in 1953, said they had reared their nine children there and had sold everything from fishing tackle and musical instruments to bicycles, while also for many years running a bar. “I am very, very traumatised by this,” she said.Her daughter Ella said they were opposed to the plan not just for the family’s sake but because they believe it is the wrong thing for Carrick-on-Shannon to replace buildings which survived since the 1800s with a glass structure. “My mother will not give up without a fight,” she said.“There are so many empty retail units, and buildings which are derelict in the town and this plan would affect seven businesses which are still trading. Surely this is the exact opposite to what they should be doing,” she added.She said that just last year Leitrim County Council had included Geraghty’s in an exhibition celebrating the county’s traditional shopfronts “and now they want to demolish it”.There is a preservation order on part of the third building which used to be known as “the canon’s house”and which is occupied by a butcher’s shop, jeweller’s and two other small businesses.Independent Cllr Enda Stenson said he had never seen the council mishandle a project to such a degree since he became a councillor in 1999.He said he and other members of the Carrick municipal council had not been informed that an application for funding was going to the Department of Housing under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF). “I was extremely disappointed with how this was dealt with, with no proper consultation especially with one of the families involved,” he added.“I certainly would support the enhancement of any town in Leitrim but I would never ever support compulsory purchase orders for anybody’s dwelling or business.”Leitrim County Council said the project was only at conceptual stage “and no planning approval process whatsoever has commenced for this concept”.The council added that if approved for funding under the URDF, “full public consultation and engagement will take place to shape and evolve what is presently a concept into a full design brief”.Only on completion of this full design stage would the planning approval process commence, it added.VisitorsThe council said that with towns throughout the country under immense pressure to survive “it is the considered opinion of the executive of Leitrim County Council, if such a destination facility was to be built in the town centre of Carrick-on-Shannon, this national trend could be reversed, and the destination centre in its own right would become a must-visit destination for all visitors travelling the N4 and local people from across the region”.The Geraghtys have said they no longer have trust or faith in the council. “We want it known that we did not and do not give our consent,” said the family.“This is our home . . . We’re devastated but there is a principle involved about knocking down buildings,” said Ella Geraghty. “Once they are knocked down they are gone.”She said the family supported the regeneration of Carrick but “we are not convinced this plan is for the betterment of Carrick”.The council previously said it regretted any misunderstanding that had arisen in submitting the application “as this was never the intention”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330683.1597437468!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools urged not to demand clean uniforms each day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Department of Education spokesman said ‘current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school’. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSchools have been urged not to impose financial pressure on families by directing parents to provide clean sets of school uniforms each day.Some parents have expressed concern about recent communications from certain schools urging that freshly-laundered uniforms or school-branded tracksuits be worn every day in order to help limit the spread of Covid-19.There is no reference in public-health guidance to daily washing of school uniforms or any clothes, and acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has confirmed no such advice has been issued by health authorities.A Department of Education spokesman said “current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school”.One mother, whose twins attend a Co Limerick primary school, said she received a note last week “encouraging” parents to have two to three crested tracksuits, “one should be washed and dried every day”. The mother said the crested tracksuits cost €35-€40 each. “That means, having twins, I may have to buy six tracksuits which are also very cumbersome to wash.”Jean Leonard, principal of the Assumption Junior School in Walkinstown, Dublin, said she was changing policy so that all pupils would wear tracksuits, whereas until now those in first and second class wore a uniform. “We are doing this because they are easier to wash,” she said. The principal said she was not asking parents to launder the tracksuits every day because it would be difficult for some, such as those living in accommodation for homeless who had no laundry facilities easily available.“I do think most parents will choose to do it and would like other parents to, but we are conscious there has not been a directive from the department on this.”Paul Rolston of the National Parents’ Council Post-Primary warned any new requirements, such as changing uniforms on a regular basis or buying additional supplies, could put parents under financial pressure. “There are issues to do with dry clean-only uniforms, cost consideration and hassle,” he said. Páiric Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network, said: “At primary, a lot of schools have tracksuits and uniforms, so there could be flexibility there. We expect schools and boards of management will be pragmatic, support families and come up with flexible approaches which put families at ease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Thursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

The ferry operator Stena Line was desperately trying to get confirmation from the Border Force and the Foreign Office that its passengers would be exempt from quarantine. The boat is meant to leave at 10pm from Hook of Holland in Rotterdam to Harwich, where it was due to arrive at 6.30am tomorrow morning. However, the ferry is due to be in UK waters by 4am, the time the quarantine rule entered into force. Thousands of others made the unexpected journey back to the UK via the Eurostar, which sold out of capacity on its last three trains on Friday a matter of hours after the Government’s announcement. Stuart and Anna Buntine, a couple who own a farm in the Midlands, spent nearly £1,000 to make it home via the Eurostar from France to London’s St Pancras Station.Mr Buntine, 58, said: We didn\u0027t get our notification until this morning, where we were staying in Burgundy there wasn\u0027t a lot of internet.I went to bed last night thinking it was all okay, woke up at 7am to find we had to get back here pretty sharpish.We couldn\u0027t get tickets, all the sites had crashed. “We had to buy business class tickets back today so it cost nearly £1,000.”Ashley Bateson, 54, Katarina Bateson, 52, from south west London, also arrived in France on Thursday just hours before the Government announced it would be added to the coronavirus red-list. The couple, who were meant to return from Paris on Monday, described efforts to purchase last-minute tickets online as “mayhem”.Those who chose to fly were faced with price increases of up to 1000 per cent. Private jet provider PrivateFly reported three times the number of enquiries and bookings for flights out of France and other countries including the Netherlands that were added to the UK’s quarantine list on Saturday.Its chief executive Adam Twidell said that the increase in demand was “instant”, and that new and existing customers wanted to change their flight plans as soon as the announcement was made.“A typical emergency flight might be for a footballer who has missed the airline and needs to get to training, but now we’re seeing the same inquiries from teachers realising they need to get back in a week’s time to start school, and headmasters are not going to appreciate if they’re stuck in quarantine,” he said. Mark Barnes, a preparatory school teacher from Isleworth, west London was holidaying with his wife and two young children, aged six and eight, in Dijon, France, but bagged a seat on a flight back from Paris so he can go back to work on August 26.I have got to get back to school. I would have to isolate for 14 days if I left it any later which would be a pain,” Mr Barnes, 51, said after arriving into London Gatwick.Ben Hillman, 42, who presents the TV show A Place in the Sun on Channel 4, was forced to cancel a two week road trip across France with his wife Gabby, 40, and their two daughters Honor, four, and Hope, five. We don\u0027t have the luxury of going on the holiday as the girls start school two days after we were due to get back,” he said. “For our youngest, Honor, it is going to be her first year of school and that settling week is so important for her.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle criticises toxic media says happy home","story":"Meghan Markle has revealed she is “happy to be home” after a long absence from the US, saying she was ready to use her voice in a way she had “not been able to of late.”The Duchess of Sussex, in her first sit-down interview since returning to her native California in March, also took a swipe at toxic media, which she said had lost the public\u0027s trust.She told Emily Ramshaw, founder of The 19th* News, a Texas-based nonprofit news organisation which launched earlier this year, that after spending years in Canada filming TV series Suits and subsequent time in the UK she felt she had returned to a different America.To come back and to just see this state of affairs, I think at the onset, if I\u0027m being honest, it was just devastating. It was so sad to see where our country was in that moment, the Duchess, 39, replied when asked by Ms Ramshaw in a virtual summit about her “experiences as a biracial woman and mother” coming home to a troubled nation. “From my standpoint, it’s not new to see this undercurrent of racism and certainly unconscious bias, but I think to see the changes that are being made right now is really — it’s something I look forward to being a part of,” she said on Friday. “And being part of using my voice in a way that I haven’t been able to of late. So, yeah, it’s good to be home.”Several months after the Duchess returned, the country erupted in anti-racism protests following the killing of George Floyd by a white Minnesota police officer.After stepping down from their royal roles earlier this year, Meghan and Prince Harry moved to California with one-year-old son, Archie.It was reported this week that the couple has bought a $15million (£11m) home in Montecito, Santa Barbara County, suggesting they were settling down in the US.The Duchess, who recently revealed that she plans to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, also spoke about the importance of voting.We need to be really aware and not take (our vote) for granted. My husband for example — he\u0027s never been able to vote, she said, in what was seen as a slight to the Royal family. The right to vote is not a privilege it’s a right in itself.The Duchess, speaking with uncharacteristic candour, went on to criticise a lack of “non-partisan” journalism, saying she and the Duke routinely point to an “economy of attention” in the media that rewards the salacious over the truthful.“What’s so fascinating, at least from my standpoint and my personal experience the past couple of years, is that the headline alone, the clickbait alone, makes an imprint,” she said. There is so much toxicity out there.The Duchess is currently involved in a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers in the UK, which published the contents of a letter she sent to her father. She has previously criticised her treatment by the British tabloids.She went on: “You wanna have trust in journalism, have trust in what you’re reading.

When family or groups of friends who know each well have met up after not seeing each other for a long time, many have forgotten the need to keep their distance, not shake hands or kiss on the cheek. I cannot over-emphasise that it is imperative for everyone to keep following the rules.”The gradual easing of France’s strict lockdown from May 11 triggered a feeling of over-confidence, Mr Véran said. Beach parties and revellers packing into crowded bars set off local surges of infections, especially on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, and several big cities.Paris and Marseille are now on the French authorities\u0027 high-risk “red” list and Britain has re-imposed a two-week quarantine on travellers arriving from France from Saturday.If the surge in infections continues, Jean Castex, the prime minister, has warned that France could be forced into a second lockdown which it could ill afford.The government is renewing appeals for people to observe social distancing and wear masks. Masks are compulsory in indoor public spaces throughout France, and most cities, including Paris and Marseille, have now made them obligatory in the most crowded outdoor areas.Some doctors have suggested that the rise in cases is misleading because France has ramped up testing. Of the roughly 3.5 million tests carried out in the country since the start of the epidemic, some 2.5 million were done in June and July alone. In May, only hospital patients were tested. Now, anyone can get a free test, even without a prescription. However, Mr Véran stressed that increased testing did not explain the surge. “This is a real increase, the signs are worrying and cannot be attributed to testing alone,” he said.France now has more than 330 clusters of infection, more than 30 of which were detected in the past two days. About half of the clusters have been linked with workplaces, according to a report by the Public Health Directorate.This suggests that many infections are being transmitted in factories or offices. A smaller proportion of French people are working from home than in the UK.About a third of the clusters have been linked with public or private gatherings, especially “extended family get-togethers,” according to the report.The number of coronavirus patients in French hospitals is creeping up and now stands at 4,864, including 374 in intensive care. More than two-thirds of intensive care patients are on the Riviera, in the Paris area, in northern France and in French Guiana, which borders Brazil.Pascal Crépey, an epidemiologist at one of France’s largest public health colleges in the western city of Rennes, said: “It is undeniable that the situation is becoming gloomier, but it isn’t dramatic yet. We are better equipped now than we were in March to monitor the epidemic and act in consequence.”   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tyre dump comes full circle fly tipper farmer gets revenge","story":"A farmer took revenge on a fly-tipper who dumped 421 tyres on his land by emptying them back onto the culprit’s doorstep.The rubbish was abandoned on Tuesday at a farm in Wigan, Greater Manchester, belonging to Stuart Baldwin – who captured the incident on CCTV.Mr Baldwin, 56, put up a picture from the footage on social media and tracked down the alleged fly-tipper to a property near his farm. He gave him three days to clean up the mess.However, when the deadline passed and nothing had been done, Mr Baldwin loaded the tyres into a truck used for his family’s recycling business and deposited them on the doorstep of the person he believed was responsible.“I got sick of it so I thought I would do a bit back. I just thought ‘I’ve had enough of this’. Fly-tipping is horrendous – why should farmers put up with it? People in the community have called me a legend and a hero. Hopefully people will now think twice now about dumping on our land.”Footage of Mr Baldwin’s actions, below, was posted online and has since gone viral.The clip shows the tyres being tipped from a truck onto the pavement outside the alleged culprit’s property.Social media users showed their appreciation for Mr Baldwin’s form of retribution. One said: “I have lost count of the number of days I wake up and find some low life has fly-tipped on our land. Good on you for finding the culprit.”A Wigan council spokesman said it was investigating the incident and urged the public to contact the council if they have information relating to the fly-tipping incident.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"florences 400 year old wine windows undergo renaissance thanks","story":"A tradition that evolved in Florence centuries ago during an outbreak of the Black Death has been given a new lease of life by the coronavirus crisis.Bars in the city’s historic centre have started reusing “wine windows”, tiny holes that were carved into the walls or wooden doors of palazzi owned by noble families.The 12 inch-high holes – known in Italian as “buchette del vino” – enabled wine to be sold without the risk of buyer and seller catching the plague, which ravaged the city in the early 1630s.An empty flask would be placed in the niche and then filled up with wine. The customer would hand over a few coins on a metal palette and the money would immediately be sterilised in vinegar to prevent infection.The holes, protected by little wooden or iron doors, were manned by servants employed by Florence’s aristocratic dynasties.Four hundred years on, the windows are undergoing a renaissance, enabling the safe serving of wine, coffee and even gelato as Italy tries to keep on top of Covid-19 by maintaining social distancing and health protocols.Over the centuries, some of the holes were sealed up or destroyed outright, particularly during fighting during the Second World War.But around 180 remain in Florence, of which 150 are found in the historic centre, and there are another 95 in other towns in Tuscany, including well-known tourist destinations such as Siena, Pisa, Pistoia, San Gimignano, Cortona and Montepulciano.There is even an organisation dedicated to finding and preserving them – the Wine Windows Cultural Association – which has produced a map showing tourists where they can see the distinctive wall openings.“It is an old tradition that you don’t find anywhere else in Italy or indeed the world,” Matteo Faglia, the association’s president, told The .“They enabled wine and sometimes food to be served safely during the plague because there was no physical contact. Now some of them have reopened and people are serving wine, cappuccinos and aperitifs.”Although the holes-in-the-wall became popular during the plague outbreak of the 1630s, they were initially created a century before.Cosimo I de’ Medici, the then ruler of Florence, decreed in the 1500s that Florence’s nobles could sell their own wine, from their palazzi in the city, without paying taxes.They were not allowed to set up bars or tavernas, so instead created the little holes in the walls of their grand homes.“It was entirely political, a way for Cosimo to keep the nobles on side,” said Mr Faglia. Noble families all had vineyards on patches of land outside the city.“If you wanted to drink Antinori wine, you would go to the Antinori palazzo, for instance. For Frescobaldi wine, you would go to the Frescobaldi palazzo. These are wine-producing families that are still famous to this day.”There were advantages for ordinary Florentines, too -- without any taxes being levied, the wine sold from the holes was cheaper than that found in shops or taverns.Although many wine windows were blocked up over the centuries, their outlines are still faintly visible on walls and in timber doors.“They are all a uniform size because they were designed to accommodate the wine flasks that were in use at the time,” said Mr Faglia. “We’re finding more all the time.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 15th august 2020","story":"People take take part in the DXB Snow Run, a three kilometre race taking place at -4 degree Celsius temperature at the Ski Dubai indoor resort in the gulf emirate as part of the DXB Snow WeekCoronavirus latest news:  Holidaymakers rush home to to beat quarantine, with France set to retaliateThai protesters adopt Hong Kong tactics while calling for royal reformLukashenko says he needs to talk to Putin, warning protests are not only a threat to BelarusFlorence\u0026#39s 400-year-old \u0026#39wine windows\u0026#39 undergo renaissance thanks to coronavirus crisisComment: Keep deriding Trump and he might just winComment: We need to slam the brakes on this cultural car crashComment: VJ Day: Today’s leaders have much to learn from the Forgotten Army’s victoryArmy of the future needs \u0026#39unconventional\u0026#39 leaders, says Defence SecretaryVaccinate your children to avoid creating burden on NHS, parents toldVJ Day: After more than 70 years, a fallen hero is finally recognised by his hometown memorialHarry Dunn\u0026#39s parents: \u0026#39It’s still too painful to look at photographs of Harry’s beautiful face\u0026#39Amid \u0026#39deep remorse\u0026#39, Japan\u0026#39s leaders hope ravages of war will never be repeatedNHS braces for increased demand for mental health support in wake of coronavirus pandemicDonald Trump gives ByteDance 90 days to est interest in US TikTok operationsTyre-dump comes full circle for fly-tipper after farmer gets revengeFall in visitors to National Trust site has upside for rare bird, as most marsh harrier chicks in decades hatchMeghan Markle criticises \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 media as she says she is \u0026#39happy to be home\u0026#39 and can now \u0026#39use her voice\u0026#39Highlands line hit by \u0026#39similar\u0026#39 landslide weeks before Aberdeenshire rail tragedyTest people arriving from red list countries to end \u0026#39quarantine roulette\u0026#39, Government toldBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/14/08/dolly-parton.jpg","title":"dolly parton black lives matter blm dollywood dixie stampede twitter","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Country music superstar Dolly Parton has explained why she renamed an offensive self-branded dinner show attraction back in 2018.In an interview with Billboard, the singer-songwriter also voiced her support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and addressed the wave of anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests that occurred in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.“I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen,” Parton said. “Of course, Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBack in 2018, the artist, who is known for hits including “Jolene” and “9 to 5”, renamed the Civil War-themed attraction from “Dixie Stampede” to “Dolly Parton’s Stampede”.Parton, who was born in Tennessee, is known for having an especially strong following in the southern US states, where support for the Black Lives Matter movement is often lower. People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

1984","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Fortnite has been banned from the Apple and Google app stores, in one of the most high-profile disputes between companies in recent tech history.On the one hand, the dispute is out of the hands of anyone using any of the companies products: customers have little say in any of these issues, and the discussion is really about how the billions of dollars generated through the app stores are distributed.On the other, the argument has affected Fortnite fans in the most direct way possible. They are now not able to get the game in the same way as they did before – and if the dispute continues and takes in more companies, other apps and platforms could be affected too.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe problem began when Fortnite began offering two ways of spending money in-game: either you could do so through the app store, and pay the full price, or you could do so by cutting out Apple and Google\u0027s payment system entirely, and developers Epic Games would give you a discount, equivalent to the fee normally taken from the store.Such a move is forbidden on both app stores. Apple and Google both stipulate that purchases of this kind must go through the app store, and developers pay a 30 per cent cut on those.Can people still get Fortnite despite it being banned from app stores?Soon after, Fortnite began to disappear from app stores. First, Apple removed it, and Epic Games sued then Google did the same, and the developers did the same too.The games are still available in some form: if it has already been downloaded on an iPhone, or through other app stores on Google. But the decision means that probably the biggest game in the world is no longer available on perhaps the two biggest computing platforms in the world.It is fairly clear that Epic Games knew its update would force Apple and Google to remove the app. And it is already trying to leverage the frustration of fans who are now unable to get hold of it, using the hashtag FreeFortnite and encouraging them to make their frustrations known.Apple and Google both argue that buying through the app store is safer and easier, both for developers and customers. By allowing the two large companies to manage the transactions, customers can check out without having to know their credit card details and being sure that their transaction is safe, and developers don\u0027t need to set themselves up with payment systems or handle complicated issues such as foreign exchange conversions they argue that the 30 per cent cut helps pay for the payment systems, security checks, marketing fees and other costs associated with running the platform.What\u0027s more, Apple and Google make the operating system and run the app stores that take users to those games. The companies presumably believe they should be compensated for that.That this represents an unfair stranglehold on customers and Epic Games themselves, and that they are taking a step to limit the power of the platform owners. It said in its legal filing against Apple, for instance, that the company had become a behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation.They are not alone in this, at all. In recent months, questions have begun to be asked by both regulators and other companies who use the app store about whether Apple, Google and other platform companies are abusing their dominance of those platforms, arguing that it is not fair to customers that they have no choice about where their software comes from, and it is not fair that developers have to pay up for access to their own customers.It is very difficult to say: Google, Apple and Epic games are three of the biggest companies in the world, and they have fallen out over a problem with two of the most powerful platforms in the world. What\u0027s more, there\u0027s no obvious compromise position, since Apple and Google must either relent on the fees, either for Epic or for everyone, or miss out on having Fortnite in their stores.Previous disputes of this kind have led to a compromise in the end. When a much smaller email app called Hey complained that it was unfair that it could not encourage people to sign up and pay through its own systems, for instance, it came upon a solution with Apple wherein it would offer a free trial to iPhone users that could be later upgraded, in what appeared to be a decision specifically calculated so that everyone could save face.It is not clear how everyone could save face in this situation. The scale of the dispute and its zero-sum nature means that someone, presumably, is going to lose.Apple could relent and allow Epic Games specifically to either pay less of a fee, or none at all, for instance. Or it could undertake a more profound change that might also get it out of trouble with antitrust investigators, such as letting iPhone users install apps through other means than the App Store.On the other hand, Epic Games could relent and come back to the app store without any change in the fee structure. That happened in the past, when it went through a public argument with Google that ended with Epic being convinced that it would after all have to keep giving a cut ot the Play Store.Or, of course, nothing could happen at all. Fortnite might never return to the iPhone, and only be available on Android devices through workarounds that would be a dramatic conclusion, but perhaps the only one that would allow all three of the companies not to give up on their publicly voiced principles.Whatever happens, the conclusion is not going to effect only Fortnite. Epic Games has already been supported by other companies such as Spotify and Tinder, all of whom have to give Google and Apple a cut of revenue too, and antitrust investigations are ongoing in the US and Europe – the Fortnite saga will almost certainly set a precedent that will be followed closely across the world.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then he added all these running scenes. So, that was it. It was, like, better than an Oscar. I was so happy! I was so happy that I got to run on-screen with Tom Cruise.”Though Wallis – who is promoting her new film The Silencing – did not elaborate on Cruise’s running rule, it appears to be in place because Cruise is concerned that other actors cannot keep up with him.Cruise has a reputation for being meticulous and extremely driven. Earlier this year, Rob Lowe reflected on working with him on the 1983 movie The Outsiders, saying the actor went “ballistic” when the pair were told to share a hotel room.When the young stars went to New York for the final selection for Francis Ford Coppola’s film, Cruise was apparently upset about not having his own suite. “It was the first time I ever stayed at The Plaza Hotel, said Lowe. I remember going, ‘Wow, this guy is the real deal.’ I mean it made me laugh, it was gnarly. But in the end of it, you can’t argue with the results. He’s had his eye on the ball since day one.”Val Kilmer, who played Tom Iceman Kazansky in 1986’s Top Gun, also said that during filming, Cruise was so “laser-focused” on making his character Pete Maverick Mitchell the “greatest action hero in the history of film” that he “refrained from revelry” with the other actors.Cruise can next be seen in Mission: Impossible 7, which has reportedly been hit by yet another delay after a motorbike stunt went dangerously wrong.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, it could be a while before fans will be able to get their hands on the next Twilight instalments. Meyer added: “I am not ready to do that right now – I want to do something brand new.”The Twilight saga was also adapted into a hit film franchise, which starred Robert Pattinson as the sullen vampire Edward and Kristen Stewart as the love-struck mortal Bella.Midnight Sun review: Time’s up for Twilight’s twisted romanceAnna Kendrick compares working on Twilight to a ‘hostage situation’Midnight Sun has sold more than a million copies in the US in a week.In the UK, 62,460 hardback copies  were sold in the three-day window between the novel’s launch and the cut-off date for sales monitor Nielsen BookScan’s charts, which was enough to launch Meyer into the number one spot. In a two-star review for The Independent, Annie Lord wrote that Midnight Sun is “a frustrating reminder of how much of popular culture focuses on a helpless woman being saved by a troubled, yet ultimately forgivable man”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

And most are itching to get back to work.Sir Keir must stop watching from the sidelines, be vocal, and help the Government get our kids back to school.He can start by seeing off this shameless wrecking bid.THE news that deaths are down on the five-year national average for the seventh week running is cause for real celebration.Butwe are to keep the good news coming, sick Brits MUST go out and use the NHS when they need it.Alarming figures released last week showed that for every three people who died of coronavirus during lockdown, another two died because they wouldn’t or couldn’t access proper treatment for other ailments.Unless Brits start dealing with their health concerns now, it’s possible that deaths caused by lockdown could end up eclipsing those caused by Covid-.The low fatality rate should also be a wake-up call for young and healthy employees still claiming that they don’t feel safe going back to work.Covid is waning, but the unemployment epidemic is just beginning.THE world is rightly raising a collective eyebrow at Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible claim that Russia has developed a working Covid vaccine.Russia’s leader has a habit of being economical with the truth, and his scientists have worked suspiciously quickly.The world is desperate for a jab to end the global misery, but Putin and his Kremlin cronies are stamping over all accepted scientic standards.This macho power play is nothing short of reckless.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looks good on the CV.I say “results” — of course, they are not results, as such. Instead, teachers have been tasked with deciding how well each student might have donerequired to sit an exam. These predictions are then weighted by the exam boards.As you might expect, teachers tend to overrate the abilities of their students. Not least because it makes THEM look good. In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating. A three-minute walk to the local river ends up with me looking like I’ve just swam a mile in it.I’ve even started wearing shorts, which I hate. The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le. Andthey were they’d be a much more attractive proposition for tourists – who would really bring money in to the local communities.Why do we preserve eight per cent of our land for the benefit of just . per cent of our population  Just so they can wear tweed for a day and pretend they’re Carlos The Jackal Probably end up glowing like one of those light sticks kids have on Bonfire Night. One expert reckoned that a side-effect was swelling up until you’re the size of the Kremlin.In the US, President Trump was suggesting swallowing disinfectant as a cure.

That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.OUR sympathies are with A-level students facing uncertainty today. Given the unprecedented situation has wreaked havoc with their exams, no solution is going to be perfect.And so we offer broad support to the Government and its “triple lock” strategy, which aims to give the vast majority of English and Welsh pupils the results they deserve.It makes much more sense than the indiscriminately clunky Scottish strategy — which saw thousands of kids miss out on good grades, until Nicola Sturgeon was forced to make a humiliating U-turn and bump grades up.We are concerned, though, about the long-term prospects of school leavers across the home nations.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He gave them out like he’d give out a good bottle of wine or a trip on his boat or a flight to somewhere…They were nothing more than objects to him.Numerous former associates of Epstein have also said that the rooms in his vast Manhattan townhouse, where Andrew is known to have stayed, were fitted with cameras.The cameras are said to have been intended to capture compromising footage of Epsteins guests.Describing the rumours, New York Times journalist Christopher Mason, a one-time friend of Maxwells, says: “The stories I kept on hearing were that in every guest bedroom in Jeffrey Epstein’s house, there were hidden cameras.“And that part of Jeffrey’s ability to manipulate was that he had this video of powerful men having sex with underage girls.And these recordings were held in a safe that Jeffrey was using as a power tool to manipulate wealthy guys to make them do whatever he wanted.”Shamed financier Epstein killed himself in a New York cell last August while awaiting trial on charges for the sex trafficking of minors.Andrew has long faced questions about his association with Epstein and alleged Epstein madam Ghislaine Maxwell, currently awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Maxwell strongly denies the allegations against her.Roberts has previously alleged that she was trafficked by Epstein over a two-year period after being introduced to him by Maxwell in the summer of .She says that, in that period, she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - once in London, once in New York, and once on Epsteins private Caribbean island.The royal has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing regarding any accusations and has not been charged with any crimes.Repersentatives for the royal did not wish to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wouldve checked Sergey Grishin outI was buying a house from him.As a woman who has had to deal with all this, its very dficult to to wake up and see Sergey Grishin selling his house to such high stature people, especially somebody like Meghan who has been such a strong advocate for womens rights.She added: I believe its important to speak out and hopefully well gain some more allies instead of picking up the computer and seeing that two allies that we would love to have are buying a house from him.This is a person who has endless resources, endless amounts of money so to get any more money from people we would like to be allies with Anna and I, and be helping us, its heartbreaking to see.I wish that they were our allies and not his buyers.Jenners legal battle with Grishin began three years ago when he filed a lawsuit accusing her and ex we Anna of having a lesbian affair and trying to defraud millions of dollars from him.He claims the women failed to pay back , he lent them to fund a movie they were making - claims both strongly deny.They hit back in a counter suit alleging that Grishin “sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we and Sulkess in text and video messages”.Grishin strongly denies all of their claims and claims he was “the unfortunate victim of a fraud”.One message allegedly from Grishin to Anna, submitted to court in March, he allegedly writes: I don’t care that you’ve given up. I will simply punish you by cutting you up piece by piece, from the tail. Until I reach your head. THAT’S WHAT’LL HAPPEN [emoticon]Your le has really ended.Another states: “I am now in Total destruction mode. Im taking steps that could do much harm to you in every possible way . . . And understand and believe I am just a killing machine now.”As well as multiple threatening messages allegedly from Grishin to both women, all submitted to court in Los Angeles, one alleged text message made a sick joke about child abuse.Another, seen by The Sun, referenced a racist joke about President Barack Obama.  But he vigorously denies any wrongdoing.Jenner was granted a three-year restraining order against Grishin by a judge in Los Angeles but remains afraid after Grishins threats, included in court papers, that he would come after, destroy and take everything from her and everyone she loves.She said: I had a trial for the restraining order and I won... the judge ruled in my favor and gave me a three-year order until April .But this is a letime of fear...I dont just go to the grocery store and feel normal.Jenner and Anna are seeking  million in damages accusing him of assault, battery, extortion, domestic violence, invasion of privacy and cyberstalking. A hearing in the case will take place in LA in October but the trial has been postponed due to COVID-.Lawyers for Grishin said: Numerous , defamatory and entirely unproven allegations against Sergey Grishin have been made and widely published without a shred of corroboration and by sources whose credibility is seriously in doubt.It should be noted that Ms. Sulkess has made numerous  statements under oath in the past and she lacks credibility. Ms. Fedoseeva has also made numerous  accusations – all part of a scheme to pressure Mr. Grishin into paying her a legal settlement to which she is not entitled. Mr. Grishin unequivocally denies harming or threatening to harm anyone. He has never been charged with any crimes because he has not violated the law. It is unfortunate that  allegations made in a civil case have now been raised because of a high-profile real estate transaction – and before Mr. Grishin had an opportunity to prove his case at trial in a Court of law.It seems unfortunately to be the case that in order to further pressure Mr Grishin into paying them money to which they are not entitled, Fedoseeva and Sulkess are using the royal couple and the purchase of their new home, in furtherance of their scheme to extort funds from SG.The truth is that Mr. Grishin is the unfortunate victim of a fraud perpetrated by his former we Ms. Anna Fedoseeva in respect of which he has been obliged to file legal proceedings against her.His legal claim sets out that fewer than two months after their marriage, Ms. Fedoseeva became romantically involved with another woman, Jenner Sulkess, and thereafter entered into a scheme to defraud him out millions of dollars to finance her and Ms. Sulkess’ lestyles.When that fraudulent scheme failed, Ms. Fedoseeva made a series of  and highly defamatory allegations about Mr. Grishin – including of physical threats and violence – which are utterly fancul, hotly denied and have no basis in truth whatever, and which Mr. Grishin trusts will be proven to be entirely  when the matter comes before the court.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The couple are reportedly calling the swanky Calornian pad their sanctuary.A source close to Meghan and Harry says: “They realised they needed a big home with a lot of space for Archie because they can rarely leave the house due to their fame, they are still quite nervous about going out and about.“They have been worried about Archie as hes been inside so much during lockdown and not interacting with other children, but everyone has reassured them that they’re doing a great job.“Meghan wanted somewhere with a spectacular garden and the house has a giant pool and pond for them to enjoy. They say this new house is their sanctuary.”And Meg, a self-professed Calornia girl, is said to have been hankering to get back to her home town.

Together, we can redesign it.“Companies like yours have the chance to reconsider your role in funding and supporting online ­s that have contributed to, stoked, and created the conditions for a crisis of hate, a crisis of health, and a crisis of truth.”He called for online communities to be “defined more by compassion than hate, by truth instead of misinformation, by equity and inclusiveness instead of fearmongering, by free, rather than weaponised, speech”.There is no suggestion the duke and duchess had any knowledge of or condoned the offensive messages.Online support from #SussexSquad Twitter accounts were hailed in the recently published unofficial biography Finding Freedom, which quoted Harry telling a friend: “To see that support and positivity means a lot.”But archived pages reveal the Henryscousin account — which was deactivated on August  — was a cesspit of abuse against the Royal Family.On September  last year, someone on the account posted: “The Queen wishes she could’ve raised her children half as good as Doria raised hers. Anyway . . .”That was followed up with: “Also, #AbolishTheMonarchy b***h.”On December , a message was posted under a video of “Kate shaking off William’s hand on her shoulder”, which read: “I really do believe he’s an a**hole.”A tweet during the Megxit talks on January  — which did not make clear who it was referring to — reads: “That ugly horse face b***h is just bitter she still lives in a dead woman’s shadow.”Nine days later, another tweet stated: “Meghan’s pit stop in the Royal Family is all these inbred hoes are gonna be talking about for the next  years.“ShE StOLe OuR PrIncE!” She did, bitch! She f***ing did!” Other tweets from someone named Just Harry include, “You never even hear Kate. She barely knows how to form a sentence” and “The way that Harry and Meghan aren’t part of that s**t, messy, toxic institution anymore is most pleasing to me”.Trin, from Lisbon, Portugal, used the same Henryscousin troll account on June  to boast of her personal call from the Sussexes.It came days after a Zoom meeting with royal staff thanking the #SussexSquad group for raising ­charity cash to mark baby Archie’s first birthday.A delighted Trin told her ­fellow supporters: “This was a short call with the sole purpose to thank us all for our efforts in putting such an amazing effort in and also for our enthusiastic support in the past two years.“They both sounded so thankful, so moved and so happy for having our support.“Meghan did tell me to, ‘Pass on the message’.“I’m humbled to have been used as a messenger to pass on their words of gratitude to you all. Calling me was like calling all of us.“Acknowledging me personally and so directly was like doing the same to all of us.”Trin said she was one of eight #SussexSquad members who had a password to the Henryscousin account but denied personally writing abusive messages.She told The Sun: “I feel like it’s not my place to condemn or approve another person’s tweets.“It’s their opinion. Henryscousin was like a forum and I had no control what other ­people posted.“The group disbanded and the account was deactivated due to irreconcilable dferences.”Buckingham Palace and The Sussexes all declined to comment last night.But royal expert Tom Quinn, the author of Kensington Palace: An intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle said the Sussexes had been “naive”.He added: “The fact that Meghan and Harry have thanked a Twitter user that is also connected to nasty, vicious remarks about the Royal Family and others shows once again just how naive they are.“The problem is that Meghan and Harry rely on their friends for advice about using social media so they get themselves into trouble.“They would be much better using media professionals.“But in this — as in so many cases — they always think they know best.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The hugs, the kisses, him coming in and scooping me up, giving me love.Its crippling. We had a honeymoon booked in the Males in September, which I had to cancel, and were planning on trying for a baby when we got back.Andrew would have been a great dad and having a family with him is one of the many things his killers have taken from me.Speaking in the interview, she recalled how she spoke to her husband after he died, telling him that she loved him and that one day they would be together again.She said: Not seeing Andrews body after he died has made it even harder for me to believe that hes gone.But I sat beside his closed coffin in the chapel of rest and told him that I loved him, that everything would be OK, and one day wed be together again.She opened up further about her anguish in losing her husband and childhood sweetheart, a man she remembers as funny, goofy, kind-natured and nurturing.She said: In killing Andrew, a good, hardworking, honest, loving man, they have taken a le that was so precious and subjected me to a le sentence without him, she said. Andrew and I grew up together so, losing him, I feel I’ve lost a whole part of myself.Heartbroken Lissie also recalled the moment she received the horric news her husband had been killed after speaking with him just hours before.

He also had a strong sense of right and wrong.On the night of August  last year, The Thames Valley Police officer was dragged to his death while in the process of apprehending a teen gang during a botched robbery near Reading, Berks.Three teenagers were convicted of manslaughter over his death after the jury deliberated for almost two days.Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , received -year terms but could be out in eight.Henry Long, , was caged for  years for driving the car which dragged the newlywed cop to his death.The court heard a car driven by Long at breakneck speed swung PC Andrew Harper like a pendulum along a country lane.The composed widow has vowed to fight for justice for her husband and pushed for harsher sentences for the wreckless teens who killed him.She said: They will be able to get on with their lives — a privilege they have taken away from Andrew.The -year-old says she has no doubt that when her husbands killers are released they will go back to a le of committing crimes.Since his death, Lissie said she has “screamed and cried every day” since the killing.She recently launched her own Andrews Law campaign for full-le prison terms for those who kill emergency services workers, including police, fire or emergency medical workers. She said: I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference that this country clearly needs.I vow to stand strong and firm with so many other honourable people in our country to make the changes that we clearly know to be justied.Her cause is being backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents thousands of officers up to the rank of chief inspector.In sentencing, the judge said nothing he can do can “restore Andrew Harper to his loving we or family, adding: His devastating loss in terrible circumstances will follow his family for ever.”Describing the killers as young, unintelligent but professional criminals, he added none of them had shown anything resembling remorse.The soft sentences dished out to Long, Bowers and Cole were met with fury by social media users.More than , people have signed a petition calling for the trial verdict to be overturned.Attorney General Suella Braverman will now look into whether the jail time handed down was too lenient after a request to review the case.However, she has no power to order a retrial, and prosecutors would either need new and compelling evidence to apply for the acquittals to be quashed, or there would need to be proven interference with the jury.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Calornia officials implemented a cap on attendance at places of worship with an order issued July  announcing that gatherings at religious institutions cannot exceed  people or  per cent of the buildings capacity.Places of worship must therefore discontinue indoor singing and chanting activities and limit indoor attendance to % of building capacity or a maximum of  attendees, whichever is lower, the guideline reads.MacArthur said he viewed the restrictions set forth by Gov. Gavin Newsom as not constitutional and burdensome and declared they made no sense in light of the actual numbers of death numbers his congregation has experienced.In fact, he told CNN he was not convinced that whats being propagated is actually reality and didnt want to add to the fear because he doubts some of the reported cases.I dont know of anybody in the church - and its a large church - whos sick at this time, he said. We havent had anybody in our church in the hospital with it through all these months.The pastor defended his decision saying: We dont orchestrate this, this is a church. We dont ask people to make a reservation to come to church.We opened the doors because thats what we are.Were a church and we’re going to trust those people to make adult decisions about the reality of their physical and spiritual health and how that balance works for each one of them.Nobodys forcing anything, theyre here because they want to be here.MacArthur said his church originally tried more creative measures to accomodate the growing crowds but felt they were standing outside in a mob. Photos and videos of Grace Community Church services in recent weeks show scores of people squeezed together inside the building with very few wearing face masks.In an interview on The Eric Mextaxes Radio Show, MacArthur said in July that the essence of worship is being together and his congregation didnt buy the narrative that they were threatening somebodys lethey went to church.MacArthur has taken the fight to the court system and filed a lawsuit against several city officials.On Thursday, the churchs lawyers announced they had filed suit on behalf of the church challenging Calornias restrictions on indoor services.Later that day, Los Angeles County sued MacArthur and his church for continuing to hold in-person, indoor worship in violation of the State and County public health orders.The county said in a statement that it took this action reluctantly after working with the church for several weeks in hopes of gaining voluntary compliance with the Health Officer Orders, which allow for religious services to be held outdoors in order to slow the spread of a deadly and highly contagious virus.Los Angeles leads the state in coronavirus cases with , infections and  deaths.Of those numbers, the community of Sun Valley recorded , cases and  deaths.Calornia has become one of several states that have seen an uptick in cases and has been labeled a hot spot.The state has seen , coronavirus cases and , deaths.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Facial threading and waxings resume in England almost five months after they were banned in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-. Snooker fansto the World Championship at The Crucible, Sheffield, to watch the final. The moves were announced alongside plans to relax rules on businesses including bowling alleys, skating rinks and casinos. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: The nationaposs hard work to keep the virus under control means we can now make further careful progress on recovery with allowing audiences back for indoor performances, fans back at sports events and the reopening of more Covid- secure leisure businesses. We must all continue to stay alert but todayaposs welcome news means these organisations can finally get going safely, and we can enjoy more of the things we love as a nation. I have no doubt that they will work incredibly hard to keep their fans, patrons and customers safe. Hereaposs what you can - and canapost - do from today as coronavirus lockdown rules are eased. Holdwedding receptions  Wedding ceremonies have been allowed since  July, but only for a maximum of  people - and that includes the photographer. But until this weekend, the happy couple havenapost been allowed to celebrate their union in a traditional knees-up with friends and family. Rules had been set to change from August  in England to allow small, socially-distanced receptions of up to  people. But the move was one of those postponed for at least two weeks by  Boris Johnson. Receptions can now take place of up to  people in the form of a sit-down meal. Live entertainment venues will be allowed to reopen for performances for the first time in months - but thereaposs still a few catches. The maximum capacity of some venues will have to be reduced to ensure social distancing rules can be observed. And theyaposll have to deep clean regularly - including between performancesthereaposs more than one a day. The guidance says people should be seated, not standing - and recommends using booths, barriers and screens between performers and audience where possible. It also says venues with balconies should keep the first m worth of seats empty, so anyone coughing and spluttering in the cheap seats doesnapost infect the entire theatre. The biggest issue, particularly for live music performances, is going to be the ban on singing. Thataposs right, venues are asked to ensure audiences donapost need to unduly raise their voices to each other and discourage singing along to music or cheering, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that encourage shouting. The actorsapos union Equity said: “While we welcome this news, the majority of live performance can’t reopen with socially distanced audiences. “Our members are still out of work and in urgent need of income support.” Have brow and facial treatments  Salons were banned from restarting close-contact beauty treatments such as eyebrow waxing and facials with just a dayaposs notice, leaving customers disappointed. That is despite salons having opened from July . The dference is because thereaposs more risk of Covid-youaposre face-to-face with someone. From Saturday, these treatments can resume, including brows, eyelash treatments, make up applications and botox. New rules mean hairdressers and salon staff will have to wear surgical masks as well as clear visors, following a change in the scientic advice. This also applies to workers who visit people at home, such as massage therapists.  About  fans will be allowed into Sheffieldaposs Crucible Theatre to watch the World Championship Snooker final which begins on Saturday. The Championship became the first indoor live sports event in England to have crowds since lockdown, allowing some supporters in for the three sessions on July . However, they were kicked out the next day when a spike in coronavirus cases led the Government to halt its gradual lockdown relaxations. World Snooker said: “We are delighted to announce that a reduced crowd will be welcomed to all sessions of the final of the World Championship on Saturday and Sunday.” The snooker was among pilot matches where fans were admitted to test the safeof spectators at sports events. Ministers hope to allow a wider , with social distancing rules in force, from October. But getting back to normal with cheering supporters packed into stadiums is a long way off. Kids canto soft play centres - but not ball pits  Soft play centres will be allowed to re-open from this weekend. But theyaposll have to comply with a strict new set of rules. They include having hand sanitiser stations, one-way systems, reduced capacity, online booking, increased cleaning and antibacterial fogging. Visitors over the age of  will have to wear face coverings - and children must stay socially distanced and be supervised at all times. And crucially, the ball pit is out. Loose play items like the balls in ball pits will have to be removed because theyaposre hard to clean.  Punters can stick or twist at casino blackjack tables, claim a strike at ten-pin bowling alleys and glide on skates around ice rinks. The venues had been due to reopen two weeks ago but the lting of restrictions was axed at the last minute as infections crept up. British Ice Skating tweeted yesterday: “Ice Rinks in England can open from tomorrow. “Yes! Letaposs get our athletes #backontheice. Thank you to everyone for their support.” Hollywood Bowl said: “Following the latest directive from the UK Government we are pleased to announce the reopening of our English bowling centres on Saturday th August. “Ten pin bowling is great all round fun whether you’re with family, friends or work colleagues. “With state-of-the-art bowling alleys, delicious food and drink and awesome arcades, we promise to keep everyone entertained.” ...and which parts of the country will remain more restricted for now  The latest lockdown relaxations do not apply in “specic areas where local restrictions are in place”. They include parts of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire. And a small section of businesses across the country must still remain closed, despite this weekendaposs fresh easing of curbs.

Boris Johnson has said there is a moral duty to get children in England back to school amid immense pressure on ministers over the botched handling of childrenaposs education during the pandemic. Schools were open to the children of key workers at the height of lockdown but all other pupils were forced to stay at home. Some year groups, including Reception and Year Six, went back in June but plans for all primary pupils to go back before the summer holidays were scrapped. A raft of guidance has been developed for schools to ensure children are kept safe from the virus. But teaching unions remain concerned about whether thecan be carried out safely. Here we answer all your questions on theto schools in England. When are schools reopening  Children willto the classroom from the beginning of September in England. The exact date is determined by local authorities but for most schools it will be September  or . While head teachers are responsible for making their schools safe, the Government has made it very clear that it expects all schools to be open. How will new-look schools work   Children will be expected back full time after the Government dismissed calls for week on, week off rotas to limit the number of pupils on site. Bubbles of  pupils have been scrapped but schools are told to keep classes or year groups apart as much as possible to prevent the virus spreading. This means limits on mixing in hallways and a ban on assemblies, collective worship and choirs - as there is an increased risk of infection from singing and shouting. Break times and lunch could be staggered to keep children apart. Social distancing should be maintained, although the guidance accepts that teachers may not always be able to stay two metres apart from pupils. Classrooms should have forward-facing desks to limit the spread of the virus and windows and doors should be opened where possible to improve ventilation. Strict cleaning measures should be in place along with access to handwashing facilities and sanitiser for pupils.  WhatIaposm worried about sending my child back to school  All children will be required to be back at school - meaning parents could face finesthey keep them at home. The guidance says it is vital for all children toto school to minimise as far as possible the longer-term impact of the pandemic on children’s education, wellbeing and wider development. With theto mandatory attendance, local authorities can fine parentstheir child misses school. Whatmy child has been shielding  Vulnerable children who were asked to shield by the Government were allowed to stay at home before - eventheir year group had ed to school. The shielding advice was paused on August , so children who were told to stay at home can nowto school. Children with family members who were shielding must also go back to the classroom. If there are local outbreaks or the Government shielding advice changes then they will be told to stay at home again. But for now, schools are told to reassure parents it is safe to send their kids back. What happensthere is an outbreak  Schools will have to declare an outbreakthey have more than two coronavirus cases in two weeks or there has been a surge in pupils taking sick days where they might have coronavirus. Mobile testing units can be sent to schools to stem the spread of the virus. Children who have been in close contact with a student with Covid- will have to self isolate at home. The whole year group may have to isolate but the entire school will not have to close unless local health protection teams deem it necessary. Schools will be asked to keep a record of close contacts between staff and pupils in dferent groups - but no details have been given on how this would work in practice. Will there be routine testing in schools   No. Schools Minister Nick Gibb recently rejected calls from unions and some scientists to regularly test all teachers and pupils. Childrenaposs Commissioner Anne Longfield raised the prospect of weekly tests to prevent outbreaks in schools. But Mr Gibb said experts advised that it was better to test people who were showing symptoms of Covid- than routine testing of whole schools. Schools will be given a small number of home testing kits to hand out to parents and carersthey think it will make it easier for a child to get tested. Otherwise, parents will be told to take children to NHS testing facilities. Will children have to wear masks   Some teaching unions have called for secondary school pupils to wear face coverings in the classroom, as children over the age of  are required to don a mask in other settings. The Department for Education disagrees, saying the protections already in place are enough to prevent the spread of the virus. Some schools have broken with this guidance however - and told parents their children must wear face coverings. It is widely accepted that it would be dficult to get primary school pupils to wear masks and a recent study by Public Health England found transmission amongst young children was low. Will the curriculum be the same  The curriculum must remain broad and ambitious, the guidance says, but schools have some leeway to help children catch up after months off school. Substantial modication to the syllabus may be necessary at the start of the year - and some subjects can be suspended for some pupils in exceptional circumstances. Schools should aim to be back to their normal curriculum by next summer.  Year s may drop a GCSE subjecttheir teachers believe it will help them perform substantially better at core subjects such as Maths and English. Exams will be back in summer , with some resits held in the autumn for A-Level and GCSE pupils unhappy with their calculated grades. Music lessons should be limited to smaller groups to deal with the heightened risk of infection from singing, chanting and playing wind instruments. Outdoor sport will be prioritised, keeping children from mixing between groups. What about travelling to school  Walking and cycling will be encouraged, while some families may want to drive children to schools. The guidance says schools should consider staggered start timeslots of children need to use public transport. Walking buses, where groups of children walk in together, could also be considered. The Department for Education is expected to publish further guidance on schools buses and other transport."},{"url":null,"title":"amazon delivery man caught urinating","story":"NewsAmazon delivery man caught urinating against recently bereaved familys garageSarah Merrix, who recently lost husband Dom to coronavirus, was left disgusted after the driver urinated on her garage and walked off without washing his hands or sanitising themShareCommentsByBethan SextonJamie Hawkins:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video amazon-delivery-man-caught-urinating-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

As the video begins, the driver is seen parked up on the street in Portsmouth. He jumps out and pops the boot, to reveal a load of parcels bearing the Amazon smile logo. He then walks over to Sarahaposs garage, unzips his trousers and begins to urinate. He looks around quickly before fastening his trousers and heading back to the car, treading in the puddle of urine as he goes. Without washing or sanitising his hands, he then picks up and removes several parcels from his boot ready to deliver. A horried Sarah took to social media to complain to Amazon, sharing the video and saying: Can you please explain to me why your driver is taking a p*** against my garage  Is this acceptable behaviour, I suggest you trace him and send him back to clean my garage.

Shopper Eve Whitty was left fuming with Asdaaposs response to her complaints regarding face masks in her local store. She said she couldnapost believe how many people werenapost wearing masks at the supermarket and went to raise her concerns with a member of staff. Eve also approached a group of men who she described as being in their twenties to ask why they were not wearing face masks and the following day she emailed a complaint to Asda, reports the Liverpool Echo. Eve has said she just wanted to highlight her concerns and was frustrated with Asdaaposs response that they are encouraging customers to wear a face covering. Asda said they are doing all they can to remind customers to follow the rules but ultimately it is up to police to enforce them. Eve visited the Huyton store on July  for one of the first times in months after she had been shopping online for herself and for her elderly relatives. She said: I said to a member of staff excuse me could I smoke in the store and she said you canapost do that in the store. I said  I was smoking in here you would stop me so why isnapost it the same for face masks and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I was absolutely fuming. Out of curiosity, Eve then approached three men and askedmasks were mandatory and they said yes, so she questioned why they werenapost wearing them. One shopper allegedly said they had breathing dficulties, so Eve asked why their friends werenapost wearing them, before deciding to walk away. The following day, Eve emailed Asda to complain as she has visited other shops were customers have been turned away unless they are exempt. But she said her biggest issue was the use of the word encouraging in part of Asdaaposs response.  In the email, Asda said: We are strongly encouraging all customers to wear a face covering when they visit our stores. We also have signs at the entrance to the store and on the shelf edges to encourage customers to wear a face covering and are using Asda FMto further remind customers.

The Japanese surrender on August ,  marked the official end of the Second World War. But while crowds flocked to Buckingham Palace to cheer the Royal Family on the balcony, celebrations where in the country were far more muted. Victory in Japan Day never sparked the wild jubilation of Victory in Europe Day three months earlier and the heroes ing from Burma, Thailand and brutal prisoner of war camps often felt their efforts were overshadowed. And ahead of today’s th anniversary, a shocking survey has revealed that almost half of Britons have no idea what VJ Day is. Armed Forces charity the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association found % did not recognise the acronym while % did not feel the need to mark it in anyway. SSAFA chairman Sir Gary Coward said: “We should all be aware of our national history, especially when associated with an unrelenting campaign and huge ­sacrice. “VJ Day marks such an event. This year, we remember  years since the day Japan surrendered, in effect bringing the Second World War to a conclusion. “Many people celebrated Victory in Europe Day but very few acknowledge or know about Victory over Japan Day.  “Thousands of Allied soldiers, sailors and airmen remained incarcerated in horrendous conditions and their many colleagues continued to fight bitter battles for freedom in the Far East well after VE Day. “Without their supreme sacrice, le would be very dferent today. “So we should take a moment to reflect on this and try to learn the lessons of this key moment in history. “The huge losses on all sides must not be forgotten.”  But millions of people around the world will be saluting the Forgotten Army today and remembering all affected by the war against Japan. World leaders will pay tribute to Second World War veterans as the UK commemorates the sacrices of its Armed Forces and Allies on the th anniversary of VJ Day.Prime Minister Boris Johnson and nine other world leaders – including US President Donald Trump, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari and Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – have recorded a video message thanking those who served."},{"url":null,"title":"builder leaves secret parliament plans","story":"NewsBuilder leaves secret Parliament plans in Greggs bakery sparking security alertBakers contacted police on Wednesday to hand over the Parliament papers after discovering them inside the Westminster branch shortly after the builders visitShareCommentsByGeorgia Diebelius:,  AUG NewsBakers contacted police on Wednesday to hand over the Parliament papers \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Even when the two ships first arrived in stormy weather tweeted saying there was no better place to watch the show being put on by the clouds, rain and wind. PO Cruises has announced that it will be extending its suspension of cruises until November  .  It means there will be more time still for the skeleton staff to enjoy some of the facilities on the ship. The Azura and Ventura first arrived in Babbacombe Bay on August . The decision to push back the suspension of the ships travel was made in line with the Foreign Office which continues to advise all Brits against cruise ship travel.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are believed to have taken out a £.million mortgage to buy their palatial nine-bedroom Calornian estate. The seller of the -built property was a limited liability company tied to controversial Russian investor Sergey Grishin. The billionaire is the former owner of another nearby home, known as the Scarface mansion after it appeared in the  Al Pacino movie. Grishin and his ex-we Anna Fedoseeva are currently embroiled in an intense legal battle. He denies her claims that he held a gun to her head and knocked her teeth out. In court documents it is alleged that he sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we andSulkess in text and video messages, the Sun reported.It is alleged he texted Fedoseeva claiming he had a Glock for her. The same documents include allegations that he pointed a gun with a silencer at her head and forced her to strip. Grishin denies the claims.A spokesperson for the Russian said he was the aposvictim of a fraudapos and claimed his ex-we planned to defraud him of millions of dollars to fund her le with her new partner, MailOnline reported.Grishin later claimed, in a lawsuit filed in Calornia, that his we and her new partner Sulkess were lovers and they were trying to trick him out of millions of dollars. When that failed she Fedoseeva began making aposapos claims against Grishin, the spokesperson added.  Fedoseeva told MailOnline: I keep reading articles which say that Harry and Meghan have aposquietlyapos bought this house. I would try and keep it quiet tooI bought a house from a Russian oligarch who was…in court for terrorising his we with a gun. He is a monster. Regardless of the homeaposs former owners, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will now need to find almost £, per month over the next  years to cover the repayments, property taxes and insurances.The couple managed to secure a mortgage despite still owing the British taxpayer £.million for the renovation of Frogmore Cottage, their former home near Windsor Castle.It was previously agreed the former senior royals would pay £, a month to repay the cost of refurbishing the cottage which they left when they fled the UK in November last year. A source said: All combined, Harry and Meghan need to find around £, per month to meet their financial commitments. It is a staggering amount. No wonder they want to get working.  The couple had faced paying much more for their new home, but after haggling over the price for the ,-square-foot house, they managed to knock more than £. million of the asking price. Harry, , and Meghan, , eventually landed the mansion which boasts a rose garden, pool, theatre, arcade, childrenaposs play area and guest house,for £. million after putting down a £. million deposit. It also has a stripper pole installed in its gym. Tax records for the seven-acre property, which took five years to complete, match limited liability companies previously created by the Duchess. Documents seen by the Mirror show the Suessexaposs house was bought by a company called the Residential Real Estate Trust on June . Although there are no names attached to the secretive trust, it matches that of a previous LLC created up by Meghan called Frim Fram Inc. Pictures previously taken inside the home show high beamed ceilings, mock real fires, a library, ten-seater dining room, spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, theatre and a wine cellar. Guests can be entertained in the games room complete with poker table,pinball machines, bar and pool table. Photographs of the interior found in old listings show one of the bedrooms has a childrenaposs bedroom shaped like a pink princess castle. Outside, the sprawling estate is hedged and gated from the street and reached by a winding drive paved with hand-cut, locally sourced stone. Beyond the entrance are tiered English rose gardens, -year-old olive trees and tall Italian cypress trees, five-car garage manicured laws and large swimming pool.  Other features include a tennis court, a childrenaposs cottage, a tea house,and on the south end of the grounds sits a two bed two bath guest house should they invite any of the royals to visit. According to US reports, Meghanaposs mother, Doria Ragland, who is helping to look after the coupleaposs one-year-old son Archie, has already been to the house. A source told the Mirror: Meghan has been desperate to find a home her and Harry can raise their family in. It no secret they would like a little brother or sister for Archie. They think they have found the perfect home in which they and their children can thrive. It wouldnapost be a surprisethey were still there when their children go on to have kids. Sources say the couple left their temporary home on Vancouver Island,Canada, in March to begin house hunting in earnest.  When they first arrived in Los Angeles, they lived in a £ million Beverly Hills mansion loaned to them by American star Tyler Perry. Real estate agent Elham Anders told the Mirror the Sussexes will have paid a premium for their privacy, not just a home. She said: People like Oprah and other stars leave Hollywood behind because Montecito and Santa Barbara provide them with the peace and quiet they want. Because it is a celebrity enclave stars come and go as they pretty much please without being bothered. Houses here are expensive, but itaposs not just bricks and mortar people are paying for - its privacy. When I speak to a lot of my clients, many place that at the top of their list in terms of what they want from a property. Harry and Meghan could live there for months without anyone seeing them.  The property is located on a private road in a luxury and secluded estate in Montecito. The home is around a two-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles, and almost every house in the multi-million-pound neighbourhood is designed for privacy, with long driveways and large gates. Neighbours include Orpah, Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Cruise, Jenner Lopez, Steven Spielberg, Whoopi Goldberg and Kevin Costner who all live close by. Some social media users have speculated Harryaposs father Prince Charles has helped the couple fund their move although sources in the States say they have paid for it themselves. According to usmortgagecalculator, after putting down a  per cent deposit, each month the couple will have to pay £, in mortgage repayments, £, in taxes and £, in homeowners insurance. It totals £,.  The Sussexes reportedly have a combined wealth of £ million. Meghan is said to have amassed £. in her acting career while Harryaposs £. million comprises of an inheritance from Princess Diana and an annual allowance from Prince Charles Since moving to north America, the Duke is known to have undertaken one paid for appearance at a star-studded JP Morgan summit in Miami in February. He is said to have earned around £, for his address. Papers for their now in liquidation Sussex Royal Foundation showed it was owed £, from an unknown source. Royal expert Ingrid Seward said the coupleaposs new expenditure was not going to be looked at very favourably.

Footage of Bill Morris smashing the window of the VW Golf went viral when it was posted online earlier this week. Dog enthusiasts praised the Thames Valley Police firearms dealer for coming to the houndaposs aid. At the time of his dramatic intervention Bill was visiting Newbury AE in Berkshire. As he waited to be seen by a doctor he walked to a nearby Curryaposs to buy a vacuum cleaner, only to spot the pooch in a hot car. He contacted the police having noticed that the Yorkshire Terrier was panting and leaning against the window. After being put through to  and waiting for minutes on the end of the phone, Bill realised time was running out.“The dog was minutes away from dying and I just thought ‘I need to do something here’, he told The Sun.Realising that no one  was going to step in, Bill decided to act. He went to his car and grabbed his axe - something he keeps with him as a registered firearms dealer. Bill asked fellow bystander Samantha Harvey to film his intervention and then swung the weapon eight times into the car window.  Once the dog was liberated he told some officers having lunch in MS what he had done, before ing to the vehicle. There he came face to face with the animalaposs owner. “I looked at herand asked hershe would leave her child in the car for an hour like that, and she said aposno I’m really sorry I don’t know what I’m thinkingapos, Bill said. He added: In that moment I knew thatI didn’t act then the dog was going to die.  Bill has urged anyone moved by his actions to donate to Battersea Dogaposs home. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: “A member of the public did smash a car window to get a dog out of a car.

The Duchess was invited to join the Royal Family at Sandringham in , and joined the traditional December lunch held at Buckingham Palace with the wider royal family too. While, according to new biography Finding Freedom, the Queen wanted Meghan to feel welcomed during the celebrations, her efforts were overshadowed by Princess Michaelaposs blackamoor brooch. Blackamoor is a style of Italian decorative art dating back to the end of the Middle ages and typically displays images of African men wearing head coverings and jewels to contrast with their skin colour. They are often depicted as servants and symbolised the subjugation of the Moors - a term describing the Muslims of medieval Spain or anyone of Arab or African descent. The image is now rightfully regarded as racially and culturally offensive and Princess Michaelaposs wearing of the accessory sparked Meghanaposs suspicions that it was a direct message to her, claim book authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. They write: In the back of Meghanaposs mind, she wonderedthere wasnapost a message being sent in the pin of the torso of an African man, wearing a gold turban and ornate clothing. At the bare minimum, it showed insensitivity to Meghanaposs African American roots and the racism she had encountered since paring up with Harry. Princess Michael has previously been accused of racism. In  she was overheard telling African American diners in a New York restaurant to go back to the colonies.  Finding Freedom, co-authored by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has been publicly released today. It documents the fairytale start of Meghanaposs entry into the royal family right through to their stepping down as senior royals and move to Canada and the US.Race was one of the factors which led to Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs decision to the quit the royal family, Omid Scobie has claimed.Speaking to Good Morning America ahead of the bookaposs release tomorrow, Scobie said: They had no choice other than to leave, because they both knew it wasnapost going to continue should they just carry on as they were. Asked directlyhe felt race played a role of their decision, he said: In terms of ticking those boxes that may ruffle feathers within an ancient institution such as that of the monarchy, she had really ticked all of them. Race did play a role. I myself have also had moments as a bi-racial royal correspondent within the institution.

We had a honeymoon booked in the Males in September, which I had to cancel, and were planning on trying for a baby when we got back. Andrew would have been a great dad and having a family with him is one of the many things his killers have taken from me. In an attempt to shield Lissie after the death, she was told she could not see his body.  Instead she sat beside his closed coffin and told him how loved he was. Lissie added: Not seeing Andrewaposs body after he died has made it even harder for me to believe that heaposs gone. But I sat beside his closed coffin in the chapel of rest and told him that I loved him, that everything would be OK, and one day weaposd be together again. She requested her husbandaposs wedding ring so she could wear it around her neck on a chain, however it vanished during the incident.  Instead, her sister Kate, , had a heart charm engraved with Andrewaposs writing from his wedding speech - in a message that read aposI love you, Lissieapos.Lissie is now calling for Harperaposs Law, which would mean those convicted of causing the death of emergency workers would spend the rest of their le in prison."},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant radford teen left red","story":"NewsPregnant Radford teen left red-faced over rude post -

The Duke of Sussex was the best man at the nuptials of the future King that went down in history. A record two billion people watched the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge become man and we on April ,  at Westminster Abbey.Harry, who now lives in Santa Barbara with we Meghan Markle and their son Archie, helped make the day especially memorable for the newlyweds and their  wedding guests, thereports.The Duke of Sussex took on the role of best man for his brother and was behind a surprise for the newlyweds after they shared their memorable Buckingham Palace balcony kiss.  Katie Nicholl wrote biography “Harry: Le, Loss, and Love” in  which gives details of Prince Harry ’s best man’s speech at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding reception.The touching speech took place at Buckingham Palace after a three-course meal and it reportedly made Kate cry, while his then girlfriend at the time, Chelsy Davy, give a aposshy smileapos. Ms Nicholl wrote: “It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. “When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. “The speech was peppered with Harry’s classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother ‘William didn’t have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kate.’ “Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate ‘Babykins’, to much laughter from the guests.” However, she reveals that Chelsy made him delete one line of his speech for fear it would leave Kate red-faced.  Ms Nicholl writes: “She had helped Harry edit the best man’s speech, sensitively advising him to take out a line about Kate’s ‘killer legs’ that might have embarrassed the bride.” Prince Harry also took responsibility alongside Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton for “transforming the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace into a nightclub” by organising disco balls and “giant glass bowls of Kate and William’s favourite Haribo sweets”.  Ms Nicholl writes: “Harry happily took on the role of master of ceremonies and made sure everyone was having a great time.” However, according to Ms Nicoll, Zimbabwean-born Chelsy decided the royal le was not for her after the wedding and an on-off romance with Harry for seven years. Ms Nicholl wrote: “Being part of the royal wedding had made Chelsy’s mind up once and for all. “The le of a royal bride was not for her and she told Harry she could never make the sacrices Kate had made.” One of Chelsy’s friends told Ms Nicholl: “It was just after the royal wedding when she realised she couldn’t cut it.

She even took Birmingham City Council to court in October last year over the unsafe condition of the flat, with the council pleading guilty to leaving the property in apossuch a state as to cause a risk of illness of diseaseapos. Two pages worth of urgent repairs were carried out, including fixing ious leaks - but she claims they simply painted over the mouldy walls and within two weeks, the damp was even worse than before. The authority apologised for delays and said aposurgent repairs were successfully completedapos, despite photos taken this weekcapturing mould across the flat.  Amy says her youngest son has been left with aposno quality of leapos, with the boy screaming in pain every hour as she applies three dferent creams to treat his aggravated eczema. After two hospital admissions, the totaposs paediatric dermatology specialist wrote to the councilaposs housing team to stress mould spores are a trigger for his condition. She warned the childaposs eczema would aposcontinue to flareaposthe mould was not fixed in the letter penned late last month and shown below.  The full time mum, who suffers from mental health issues, told BirminghamLive: The photos donapost do it justice. In person, heaposs got about  per cent of his skin that looks like heaposs been burnt with a kettle of water. The doctors have said he has got no quality of le. He doesnapost sleep because of the itching and how sore he is. He shouldnapost have to be in the pain heaposs in. Every hour I have to apply three dferent creams thataposs every hour - even during the night. He screams as I put it on as well.  During a weekaposs stay at the childrenaposs hospital - and while away from the council flat - the mum explained how his eczema aposalmost disappearedapos. We actually started to be able to see part of his skin, she said. But by the time he got discharged, within just a few days, he was back red raw and you couldnapost see any of his skin again. Her four-year-old Theo also suffers from eczema, with occasional flare-ups, though theyaposre not as severe as her youngest son. Her three-year-old son Jaydon doesnapost have any issues.  She also claims her toilet was broken by the council and she waited three days for it to bring a portaloo at the start of July. In which time, her family-of-four were left using aposbuckets and pop bottlesapos instead. I had a blockage and and as they went to unblock it they smashed the whole bottom of my toilet.  They left that there, with all faeces still at the bottom. I had to use all my duvet covers and towels to clean it up off the floor, because it all flooded. The smell was not only in my house but you could smell it outside the property. Keeghan is meant to have at least minimum two baths a day for his skin, but he hadnapost had that for three weeks because I wasnapost bathing him in a stinking bathroom with faeces and urine in the air.  They [the council] left and they didnapost come back for three days with the portaloo. [When it came] it only got cleaned out twice while we had it for a month. Theyaposre supposed to clean it every other day. The toilet repairs were eventually carried out after more than three weeks - while the council say the problem was aposresolved as swtly as possibleapos. Itaposs degrading. They donapost even care. Iaposve cried on the phone. They just wonapost listen. The mould has been like this for five years and they have got worse since then, she added.  Iaposve told them itaposs not just a painting over job. I just want them to recty the problems, actually sort it out, because all theyaposve done for the past five years is come back with this aposmagic paintapos to stop paint and mould but it just comes back twice as bad. Birmingham City Council claimed all the aposurgentapos repair works were carried out in October last year following the court case. But it promised to follow up with Ms Harrison to fix any aposoutstanding issuesapos as it stressed that it aposneeded tenants to provide them accessapos to the property. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: “While we apologise for any delay to repairs carried out, we do need our tenants to work with us.

Last night, it was announced that France, The Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks  Caicos and Aruba will added to the quarantine list from am on Saturday. Today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed the threshold for putting countries on the quarantine list. The Tory minister said it is  cases per , on a seven-day rolling average.Email us about your holiday experiences  webtravel@trinitymirrorMr Shapps told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With France and these other countries, the Netherlands and where, the numbers have now just got above the threshold - which is about  cases per , measured on a -day rolling average. “That’s what the Joint Biosecurity Centre will be looking at.” The government has previously refused to say exactly how countries are added to the quarantine list. Downing Street this week warned experts look not only at the infection rate per , people, but also at the testing rate and reliability of data which each country produces. The decision to add France to the list brought chaos for holidaymakers as they tried to rush home before the deadline.  The Foreign Office also now advises against all but essential travel to those destinations - in a blow for holidaymakers still planning on visiting as many travel insurance policies will be invalid. France is the latest popular holiday destination to be removed since Spain was removed on July , just five hours after it was announced.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab previously warned the government couldnapost give a guarantee that more countries wouldnapost have restrictions imposed.In an interview with Skyaposs Sophie Ridge Mr Raab said: “As we found with Spain we can’t give a guarantee.  All we can say is we’ve got this joint bio-security centre - you can see we monitor the risk in real-time. We take decisive, swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summer to people who go abroad and thataposs why our advice is to follow the Foreign Office travel advice which will also link in with the quarantine principle, look very carefully at doing that. Following Shappaposs revelation, all eyes are now on countries with rising rates. Weaposve taken a look at the data to see where is safest to travel, and where the number of infections is rising, which includes Brit holiday hotspots Croatia and Greece. Even Turkey may not be safe as the number of infections continues to rise.  Between August  - , new cases in Croatia rose to . per ,, up from . for the previous seven days. Thousands of holidaymakers have jetted off to Greece after Spain was removed from the apossafeapos list - but the rate of infection has risen rapidly.The number of new cases surged to . per ,, a figure that will have alarm bells ringing in Westminster as it jumped up from . for the previous seven days. The government has imposed strict restrictions, including orders that all bars and restaurants in Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Rhodes, Zante and Crete close at midnight. Gkikas Magiorkinis, assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at Athens University, said on August : “We can say that Greece has formally entered a second wave of the epidemic. This is the point that we could win or lose the battle.The number of new cases in Denmark is also high, with officials watching as it jumped to ., from . per , for the previous seven days. And in the Czech Republic and Switzerland , the rate of infection rose to ., from . and . respectively.It has been speculated that holiday favourite Portugal could soon be added to the apossafeapos list, but officials may wait a little longer as the rate of cases jumped from  to . per , residents.The rate of infection in Poland remained at a similar rate, with the number of cases rising from . to . per ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/David-Anderson-at-Geitaoui-Hospital-1-852x564.jpg ","title":"angus born medic flies to beirut to help with worst mass casualty event he has ever faced","story":"An Angus-born hero medic has told of the humanitarian catastrophe facing the people of Beirut following last week’s massive explosion.Montrose-born nurse David Anderson, flew to the Lebanese capital within days of the explosion, which killed more than  and injured ,, to help people in the disaster-stricken city.Many injuries and widespread damage reported in huge Beirut explosion\" title\"#Many injuries and widespread damage reported in huge Beirut explosion# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    many-injuries-and-widespread-damage-reported-in-huge-beirut-explosion embed # secretofnrZedFo\" data-secret\"ofnrZedFo\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"David, a health advisor with charity UK-Med, believes the task facing humanitarian aid workers in Beirut is an even tougher than the challenge he faced dealing with the West Africa Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone in -.The -year-old said: “The Ebola crisis is one thing and it wasn’t a very pleasant task, but this is absolutely the biggest thing that I have been deployed to for support in relation to a mass casualty event. It’s huge. It’s the first time I’ve had to attend something like this.“You cannot help but feel empathy for the iniduals you see walking around who are wounded as well as for the staff in hospitals we speak with to make a full and proper needs assessment.“We were not there when those patients came through the door – however you can see the aftermath and it’s not a pleasant thing.”Working with charities UK-Med and Humanity Inclusion, David will report back to the Department for International Developmenton what help is needed.He is part of the UK aid-funded UK Emergency Medical Teamwhich was deployed to Beirut, to help the Lebanese in the aftermath of last Tuesday’s devastating explosion.The UK has pledged £ million to the World Food Programme and £m to the emergency relief effort in Beirut.Lebanon was already struggling with a spike in coronavirus cases when the blast hit.David said: “We’ve visited the blast site. It’s a crater and the buildings in the immediate vicinity of the warehouses have been pretty much levelled.“As you move backwards, the shockwave has struck other buildings and all the glass has clearly been blown out.”The UK EMT medics have been visiting affected health facilities across Beirut and meeting with Lebanese health workers and clinical staff, to get an in-depth understanding of how the multiple crises are affecting healthcare provision in Lebanon.They#ve been listening to their assessment of outstanding needs and gaps, to build a comprehensive picture of how the UK can best support.Many casualties will need long-term rehab after suffering slashed tendons and deep cuts to arms, legs and faces from flying glass.David, who now lives in East Midlands, hailed Lebanese medics for saving countless lives in the aftermath of the disaster.He said: “The Lebanese people have done an outstanding job at coping with a mass casualty event on a scale that is just unimaginable.“Geitaoui Hospital was a modern and well-equipped facility, set up to deal with trauma and Covid- to an excellent standard.“The hospital has been utterly devastated by the explosion and shock wave, which rendered the entire facility unusable.“The teams in the hospitals, even though the buildings had some fundamental damage, have dealt with the casualties extremely well.“As an emergency nurse and humanitarian health advisor, I can only imagine how horric it was to deal with the huge numbers of patients in the initial hours after the explosion.“It’s astounding that there were so few casualties, which is testament to the extraordinary efforts and skills of the Lebanese medics.“The challenge now is looking beyond the immediate crisis and getting health facilities up and running again. It’s clear that Covid- will be a signicant issue in the coming weeks.”International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “The Lebanese people continue to be in our thoughts at this terrible time.“The UK is sending these world-leading medics to use their expertise and to make sure the people of Lebanon get the help they need as quickly as possible.“This field team comes on top of the UK’s substantial military support and aid package.“We will do everything we can to help the people of Lebanon in their hour of need.”With the August  explosion believed to have been caused by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate – which were stored in a warehouse – civil unrest is making le harder, with hospital visits disrupted by road blocks and demonstrations.UK medics to fly to Beirut to assist health response\" title\"#UK medics to fly to Beirut to assist health response# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    uk-medics-to-fly-to-beirut-to-assist-health-response embed # secretKGxEMKGuja\" data-secret\"KGxEMKGuja\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

To the best of my knowledge, he#s not a member of the SNP.#I can#t interrogate how people vote and nor should I interrogate how people vote. It#s a personal choice.#Nicola Sturgeon added that recent polls, which predict an SNP landslide at the next Holyrood election, could create an #issue#these iniduals are barred from holding appointments based on their qualications.She said: #On the basis of current opinion polls, more than half of all the Scottish population intend to vote SNP so there would obviously be an issuewe started to exclude people who have qualications to do things from doing these things because they might vote SNP.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#I don#t think it should be relevant in terms of somebody#s ability to do a particular job that needs a particular specialism, which I don#t think anybody doubts Mark Priestley has.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonThe academic came under fire after the Daily Record revealed tweets he posted ahead of the last general election, in December, one of which stated that the #clear# message in some seats was #vote SNP or get a Tory#.He also tweeted that supporting Neale Hanvey, a candidate who was suspended by the SNP amid an anti-Semitism row, before being readmitted to sit as an SNP MP in June, was perhaps a #lesser of two evils#.Education Secretary John Swinney announced Prof Priestley#s appointment during a statement in which he also apologised to pupils directly affected by the downgrading of awards. Mr Swinney said that it was #deeply regrettable we got this wrong# and announced all downgraded results would be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.He also told parliament that the government hoped to learn lessons for the future and said the review led by Prof Priestley would provide initial findings within five weeks.Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Scottish parents and pupils demand a #truly neutral and fully independent review# into the exams debacle.#If the SNP are serious about righting their wrongs over the fiasco, andthe public are to have any faith in this review, they must consider removing Mr Priestley#, he added.Prof Priestley has been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners. Donrsquot worry, it doesnrsquot mean another mouth to feed, there are plenty of really great looking fake ones to buy.Have you tried shopping from other rooms in your house  Yoursquod be surprised at how much you can change your rooms by simply swapping the accessories about.HallwayTherersquos nothing nicer than a warm welcome so donrsquot forget your hallway when yoursquore giving your home a makeover.If itrsquos on the small size then good advice is to keep it nice and bright to give the illusion of space and add colour by adding some prints to the wall, some useful hanging hooks and even a funky doormat.Everything in your hallway needs to have a practical use, but that doesnrsquot mean it has to be boring.You can add plants here too butyoursquore limited on floor space, why not try some hanging baskets or small potted plants on shelves.Maybe go the extra mile and paint the doors in your hallway  This trend is becoming more popular, with people opting for painting their doors and skirting boards, from pink to yellow and even black.Hopefully, these tips have given you some DIY inspiration to give your home a little low-cost makeover."},{"url":null,"title":"online-edinburgh-festival-12-must-see-shows-events","story":"Thats exactly what has happened.You cant generally hit pause and play at the same time, but the Edinburgh Festival has managed it for its  iteration, with a rich, brave and pioneering programme of mostly digital and online events with here and there a visual treat for capital residents and those tourists who have decided to come anyway.The theatres may be dark but, as the programme makes clear, the artistic light burns bright regardless.My Light Shines On DisplayAs well as being the umbrella title for much of the digital offering from this yearrsquos Edinburgh International Festivalndash Kirsty Wark fronts the programme, which features a performance by Scottish Chamber Orchestra cellist Su-a Lee ndash My Light Shines On is also a light display project which will illuminate the cityrsquos famous festival venues.Using beacons of light which will be visible from vantage points across the capital it has been created by Scottish lighting designers Kate Bonney and Simon Hayes, the duo behind Pitlochryrsquos Enchanted Forest and the Electric Glen in East Renfreshire.The inspiration is the tradition of the so-called lsquoghost lightrsquo in which a light is left on in a theatre even when the venue is lsquodarkrsquo, as all theatres currently are.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

with lyrics perfectly capturing the feel of obsessive young relationships: Sometimes all I think about is you  Late nights in the middle of June.Big electronic drum beats feature throughout the album but a whimsical, nostalgic vibe creeps in through lighter synths and twanging guitar on the title track Dreamland, and Melon And The Coconut.A standout track is Your Love , released back in February, which pays tribute to the production styles of Justin Timberlake and Missy Elliot with its driving beat and dance-y melody.As well as being rammed with enormous tunes, the wistful, throwback lyrics make Dreamland an apt and strong contender for one of the major sounds of an unconventional summer.Mike BediganMADE OF RAINTHE PSYCHEDELIC FURSMade Of Rain, the first album from The Psychedelic Furs in  years, proves the new wave darlings havent lost their edge.In recent years the group have reformed on a semi-regular basis to play live dates.But they said they had begun to \"feel like a jukebox\" and set about writing new material to bolster their sets.The Furs sported a rotating line-up throughout the s, anchored by the presence of brothers Richard and Tim Butler.They released a cluster of seminal records including s Mirror Moves but towards the end of the decade the quality began to drop off.Made Of Rain recaptures some of the heady glamour of their early albums, and a fair dose of their swagger.It is also a markedly darker affair ndash and thats saying something for the band that inspired The Horrors and Interpol.Pounding drums, soaring synths and brooding vocals are all present, but most importantly, the songs are just excellent.Alex GreenWASHED OUTPURPLE NOONA decade on from the heyday of the microgenre known as chillwave, Atlantas Ernest Greene s with his fourth album as Washed Out.Opening track Too Late sounds instantly familiar, mid-tempo, muffled vocals conveying a vague sense of unease and regret, s drums, washes of synths.With the shock of the new long gone, this laid-back, tasteful sound seems more like yacht rock than the cutting edge, and can easily blend into the background.Chillwave always tends to be described as summertime music, hazy and shimmering, and, listening during a heatwave, Purple Noon ticks all those boxes -

While the Scottish Government, which is ultimately responsible for safeguarding public health, has a major role to play, I believe businesses are better placed to make things happen and to do so far more quickly.The best way forward should involve a new approach with business taking the lead to implement greater safety measures with the support of government and other public sector bodies.This will start with business owners and managers stepping up and being more proactive in ensuring they operate within a safer framework to stop the spread of this virus. As well as providing a clean and safe environment for their customers at all times, they will also need to consider implementing other creative measures and better utilising existing technology.We are already seeing a number of examples of this across the globe where businesses are driving forward on-the-ground initiatives to reduce the risk of a further lockdown. Restaurants in Kinsale, in County Cork, Ireland have, for example, begun testing the temperatures of all their customers upon entry. Meanwhile Tourism Portugal has introduced ldquoSafe  Clean certication which enables participating hotels to provide the reassurance they have undertaken the appropriate level of disinfecting and have made hand sanitiser available to guests throughout their stay. Even McDonaldrsquos has gone beyond government guidelines by making the wearing of masks mandatory for all customers entering any of their , US restaurants.While businesses in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland should be taking the lead in bringing new and effective measures to fruition, the support of the Scottish Government will be essential as well as beneficial. Agencies including Scottish Enterprise, where we have made initial representations on this issue, could provide grants and other support measures. This could help many hard-pressed businesses put temperature monitoring devices for both staff and customers as well as other facilities in place at a time when the strain on their finances may otherwise prevent such expenditure.

We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting. So the question is: will licensing change the behaviour of those people  Or do we have to go further and ban driven grouse shooting completely Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There remains a widening gap between high-level rhetoric and delivery on the ground. However, there are a number of statements which suggest the government is beginning to give the necessary prominence to the role that investment in our natural environment can play in addressing the climate, nature and economic crises.In accepting the recommendations of its own Advisory Group on Economic Recovery, the Scottish Government is taking a new ldquofour capitals approach which involves viewing the economy through four pillars of economic, natural, human and social capital. Just as importantly, it is accepting the advice of the group ldquoto treat each pillar as equally important.Government recognises that improving our wellbeing is dependent on our ability to conserve and grow our natural assets. It also appears to have accepted the radical advice of the Scottish Infrastructure Commission that the next Infrastructure Investment Plan should have natural infrastructure as a key component.In other aspects the plan lacks urgency and clear time commitments. Much of the detail seems to have been left to the update of the Climate Change Plan and the Infrastructure Investment Plan. Sadly, a clear timetable is also lacking and all we are told is that there will be ldquoregular updates to the plan.There is welcome acknowledgement that investing in our natural environment, nature-based solutions and green skills are vital to address the twin climate and bioersity crises. Nonetheless, to be genuinely transformational government will need to go further than existing commendable commitments to peatland restoration and vague pledges of ldquowoodland expansion.Government must ensure that we also maintain our peatland in good condition, prevent further damaging extraction and horticultural use and invest in native woodland. Nature-based solutions must also go further and include investment in greening our cities and enhancing the marine environment.With the Scottish Budget already under signicant pressure, providing the necessary funding for nature-based solutions is going to be even more of a challenge. This cannot, however, be an excuse for further delay. Investment in our natural assets must get a fair share of the poundbn earmarked for infrastructure plans. We also need to consider how to make better use of existing funding and instruments like the infrastructure levy. The UK Committee on Climate Change has advised that we must also consider changes in tax policy. The Scottish National Investment Bank also has a key role to play.One low cost and high impact measure that could unlock a whole range of new conservation opportunities would be for the next Scottish Budget to kick start a new Conservation Finance Fund with initial public seed investment to help lever in private finance. This would build on the collaborative work led by SEPA and the Scottish Wildle Trust on the ldquoRoute Map to pound Billionrsquo.If the necessary public and private funding is forthcoming, then the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed partnership approach and the desire to involve communities much more in decision making is also key to success. However, we must ensure that communities and NGOs are engaged on an equal footing with business.

This is not true but we are currently experiencing a constant bombardment of the SNPs mantra with little air-time given to the opposition viewpoint.We are in danger of losing our way and having independence foisted upon us with all the rather unpleasant consequences that the SNP, with Green support, are happy to sweep under the carpet.

Secondly, he produces a set of statistics which accurately show how far the UKs NHS is falling behind its OECD equivalents, and somehow implies that the Scottish Government is equally responsible for that.

Why is this, I ask  The answer is that we have all been deeply brainwashed by Ms Sturgeon and her daily TV broadcasts, lasting more than four months now. Please would someone call Amnesty International Ian Forbes, Glasgow G.THERE is an interesting contrast in apparent attitudes to taking responsibility between Fiona Robertson, Head of SQA and Leslie Evans, boss of our civil service. Ms Robertson has been willing to take the  on her own to defend her agencys position that, unmoderated, this years results would have been unfeasibly higher than the previous years: an attitude for which she courageously offered no apology . Her problem may well be that the model employed was crude in terms of statistical theory and practice, as one of your recent correspondents has helpfully pointed out, but that doesnt take away from the principle thatthe numberslook wrong, they probably are. Criticism of her and her staff should be balanced by that and by recognition that this was never going to be an easy job.Leslie Evans , in contrast, seems to be doing everything possible to avoid recognising that a hash was made of a relatively straightforward disciplinary process, which likely was or should have been set down in the Scottish Governments code of working practices . All this to the extent that anyone with any knowledge of the judicial review process would have backed Alex Salmond for a winner. The inquiry chairman is to be congratulated for demanding clear and personal answers from Ms Evans.Brian Chrystal, Edinburgh EH.JUST who is the Scottish Government  Your reportage of the Holyrood inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle continually links ldquothe Scottish Government with behaviour likely to obstruct the investigators getting access to facts related to the original botched probe into the alleged behaviour of the former First Minister. However, the name that persistently crops up is that of a civil servant rather than one of a minister or elected or list MSP.I would have thought that a civil servant, as the name implies, is neither a member of nor part of a government but an inidual in a supporting structure charged to carry out the instructions of the sitting executive.It is important in view of the upcoming Scottish elections that there is clarity in just who is not being completely cooperative with the current investigators is it the civil service or is it the SNP administration.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ROSEMARY Goring says that the Prime Minister is coming to Scotland again because he wants to save the Union . But does he Consider this his parliamentary majority of  must be in danger, judging by his calamitous approval ratings, and the fact that Labour now has a credible leader.So might he not welcome the chance to lose  non-Tory seats before the next General Election, thus improving his chances of winning He may lead the Conservative and Unionist Party, but he has already jettisoned the support of the Northern Ireland Unionist faction, whence comes the \"Unionist\" part of the party name, with his border in the Irish Sea to finalise the EU withdrawal agreement. Might he find it even easier to let Scotland secede, taking its troublesome non-Tory MPs out of the House of Commons  The six Tories would be collateral damage but a price worth paying.Also, by dint of the border and the dependence of the vast majority of Scottish exports upon English ports, he could still keep Scotland on a tight rein.In the meantime we face the prospect of a disrupted food supply due to the forthcoming Brexit shambles. Could that be why the Prime Minister is suddenly keen on fighting obesity, in the hope that we will accept the resulting shortages, perhaps even rationing, as all part of a national weight-loss strategy It could be that there is method in the Prime Ministers madness after all.Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.Read more: Swinney survives no confidence vote"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-ramsay-street-recasting-far-first","story":"So who is being recast If you donrsquot want any spoilers, donrsquot read onhellipotherwise, Australian actor Tim Robards, who plays businessman Pierce Greyson on the show, is departing.

Mmm, lovely. Just what I had heard, so it was interesting to see David Millers letter on social distancingand the oxymoron thus produced in those two words.One of the examples of an oxymoron in my book is the placing of \"a carefully careless scarf\", but because it echoes my own intense dislike of mobile phones and other small devices, which are playing a massive part in the daily le of this planet, I prefer to think of Milton and his \"precious bane\" . The authors of the book mention that \"someone had neatly combined the contrarieties of the telephone as a boon and curse, using Miltons words, \"O, precious bane Tormenting joy Dividing chain Exacting toy\".Too true, when you really think about it.Thelma Edwards, Kelso."},{"url":null,"title":"five-must-read-scottish-books-headed-tv-film","story":"ConvictionSpeaking of Witherspoon, she chose Conviction by Denise Mina as her Hello Sunshine Book Club pick last December.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork.

He theorised that food production could not keep up with human population growth, leading to starvation, war, disease and general catastrophe.In fact, wersquore nowhere near filling the planet with people: put together in a huddle, every person on Earth would actually fit on Islay, with room to spare. Nevertheless, the global population continues to rise, compounding the environmental problems humanity currently faces.This population growth is one of the areas that will be highlighted in Earth Overshoot Day , which this year takes place on August . It marks the moment in the annual calendar when humanityrsquos demand for ecological resources and services starts to exceed what nature can regenerate.The EOD organisers stress one simple truth ndash that the more of us there are on the planet, the less of it there is for each of us. Every person has to be supported in areas such as food provision, healthcare, social ing and waste management, many of which challenge and compromise the environment.The statistics are sobering. If every second family had on average one fewer child, then the projected world population of . billion by  would fall by a billion. By the end of the century, that drop would be four billion.Importantly, that reduction would move Earth Overshoot Day back by a month by .It would mean  per cent more biocapacity per person by the year  ndash a hugely signicant and positive change.Providing high quality education for women also helps to tackle population growth and the accompanying strain on resources. Statistics produced by the World Bank show that the dference in family size between women with no schooling and those with  years of school learning is four to five children per person.Those with the benefit of full education marry later, have smaller and healthier families, and invest in their children. It is clear that female learning generates social change, takes pressure off the planetrsquos resources and acts as a major driver of womenrsquos empowerment.The stark disparity in population growth between developed countries and less developed ones can be seen by comparing Scotland to other poorer nations.In this country, the total population in  was calculated at . million. According to the National Records of Scotland, this is set to rise only slightly to . million by  and then level off.By comparison, Nigeria ndash the most heavily populated country in Africa ndash is predicted to be set to grow from its current  million to  million by  and more than  million by the turn of the century.By lowering the number of people on the planet, we ease the pressure on resources. And as we consume, so we also discard. The levels of waste we generate are frighteningndash and growing.At present, the average person in the United States throws away their body weight in rubbish every month. Population increase means waste has increased tenfold over the last century, and it is now expected to double again by .Recycling and composting are having an impact, but they are not holding back the tide. Urban areas, which now house half the worldrsquos population, are the worst affected, but we are now seeing waste plastic in almost all of our oceans and rivers.How can this problem be mitigated, particularly as societies become wealthier, creating yet more packaging and a throwaway culture  Industrial processes can be improved there can be a greater drive towards re-use and recycling rubbish charges have been seen to have an effect.MADE TO LASTHere at home, there is a drive towards creating a circular economy, a model that aims to eliminate waste and resource over-use by encouraging an extension of the le cycle of products and equipment through initiatives such as sharing, refurbishment and remanufacturing.The Scottish Government published its own vision for this, titled Making Things Last, in , and Zero Waste Scotland took this further through its own study in June.This identies a number of key principles including being led by the available evidence achieving absolute emissions reductions prioritising reduction of emissions over offsetting going beyond net zero and sharing successes and failures to help drive change.Louise McGregor, Head of Circular Economy at the organisation, said this circular model provided a tool not just to dispose of waste in an eco-friendly way, but to reduce it in the first place.ldquoThatrsquos much more effective than waiting for the waste to be generated and then recycling it. Most of the carbon is associated with the production of the products rather than getting rid of it at the end of its le.She described the circular economy as a ldquosystems level approach, explaining: ldquoIf you take something like food waste, then we can do quite a lot to collect that and reprocess it, and of course thatrsquos all beneficial.ldquoBut with a circular economy, you think about things from the start ndash how it is produced in the first place and what you can do at each stage so that waste isnrsquot there to start with. Historically, wersquove not been very good at doing that.Another problem, she says, is that we have developed a throwaway culture. ldquoItrsquos often cheaper to buy something new than to repair a product. One way of incentivising a new approach is to use economic levers. We need to ask how we can use the tax system to make it more cost effective to do the right thing.The countryrsquos farmers, too, are in the front line of the battle against climate change. A report commissioned by WWF Scotland earlier this year raised the prospect of mitigation measures that involve little or no change of land use.Suggested steps included improvements to animal health and breeding, feed additives, use of nitrogen fertilisers, rotational grazing and using plants such as clovers to fix nitrogen levels.Dr Sheila George, the organisationrsquos Food and Environment Policy Manager, said: ldquoAgriculture is at risk from a changing climate but can be part of the climate solution.ldquoOur land is our biggest natural defence against climate change and farmers and other land managers have a key role in protecting it. We need to produce food in a way that reduces emissions and locks up more carbon. ldquoShe added: ldquoBy adapting our farming methods, Scotland could be at the forefront of the global transition to climate-friendly farming with unique export and branding opportunities arising.lsquoldquoTo get there, we need to see a reframing of rural policy andfinancial support along withadvice and training available for land managers."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-dont-let-hubris-derail-independence-dream","story":"This hasnrsquot stopped a familiar assortment of SNP loyalists from proclaiming the polling results as a decisive, popular endorsement of their partyrsquos policies. They have greeted the YouGov poll indicating % support for Scottish independence with hubristic glee.The English examination results ndash afflicted by the social inequality which disfigured Scotlandrsquos ndash were greeted with a similar sense of conceit. ldquoSee: theirs were worse than ours. For a party committed to reducing educational inequality it doesnrsquot quite butter the parsnips. Such a response ignores the real source of anger at the moderation of Scottish pupilsrsquo examination predictions: that the inequalities and disadvantages spewed out by the process merely highlighted those which lie embedded in the educational system after  years of devolved government. Coronavirus merely exposed what has lain submerged for generations. It would be foolish to regard the sunny numbers in favour of independence as indicating popular absolution.The SNP ndash and by extension the cause of independence ndash have enjoyed a rewarding lockdown. Those residing outside the Holyrood bubble consume their politics via the early evening television and radio news programmes. For the last five months we have clung to these bulletins as theyrsquove updated us on the shting levels of threat to our mortal existence. They have been dominated by two people: the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Scotlandrsquos champion is universally seen to be confident, honest and empathetic the other chap: well ndash letrsquos be charitable here ndash signicantly less so.This is an important ergence at any time, but during a period of national emergency it becomes critical. When your le is in danger you attach less importance to more mundane matters such as education and the handling of the economy. In time, though, these will cease to be mundane and we will resume our close scrutiny of them.The state of emergency has also revealed how enfeebled the opposition to Ms Sturgeon and her administration has become. The Scottish Tories have been forced to jettison one leader and are currently being led by a part-timer who sees her future beyond the reach of democracy in an upper-class, private drinking club.The Labour Party in Scotland meanwhile is led by a poor chap who looks like he is about to cry every time he takes to his feet. Their support has been reduced to those who plough on for old timersquos sake. Between coronavirus and Europersquos most ineffective political opposition the SNP are governing Scotland free of scrutiny. In such circumstances % support for independence is the very least you should be expecting. Such circumstances wonrsquot prevail when a live referendum is unfolding. And Irsquom not convinced the party is anywhere near fit enough to fight one any time soon.On the three most pressing matters which will come to govern a second referendum the SNP donrsquot appear to have made any progress in the six years that have elapsed since the last one. There is no plan for joining the EU and no acknowledgement that such a process could take anything from two to five years. There is still no position on what currency an independent Scotland would use and no workings for settling the border issue with England. Indeed, the only body making the running on what an independent Scotland could look like ndash socially, culturally and economically ndash is Common Weal, the independence-leaning think-tank and advocacy body. But according to Stewart McDonald, the SNPrsquos spokesperson for defence at Westminster, Common Weal are to be regarded with disdain.In a bizarre tweet about the current upheaval in Belarus, Mr McDonald, who strives eagerly to be part of the SNPrsquos inner sanctum, said: ldquoIncredible events unfolding in Belarus: an uprising on the European continent, against an authoritarian Soviet dictator, led by women of courage and substance with their fellow citizens at their back. Common Weal types oddly mute. Quite what Common Weal was supposed to have said about a country . miles away is anyonersquos guess. Perhaps theyrsquoll issue a paper on it. Though Irsquom not sure that ponticating on another countryrsquos internal disputes is a good look for an organisation that resents interference in Scotlandrsquos own affairs.Another emerging problem for the SNP is the calibre of those in its Twitter wing who this week breathlessly announced their intentions to seek the partyrsquos nomination for Holyrood. That none have yet passed party vetting or consulted with local organisations has not dimmed their optimism, which seems to be founded purely on nods and winks at SNP headquarters. You donrsquot want to be unkind here, but each of them would melt in the heat of a y referendum campaign.They are also known among activists to have participated in the stitch-up preventing Joanna Cherry and her Westminster colleagues from ing to Holyrood. This has also caused deep resentment among ldquoCommon Weal types who will do most of the heavy lting at the next referendum. There remains simmering resentment in the party at the juvenile delinquency of the NEC in this matter and this has resulted in the threat of cancelled memberships and reduced subscriptions.This is unfortunate for a party which is currently encountering choppy financial waters and continues to face questions over the pound, in donations it received in  to fight the referendum that never was. Irsquom sure everything is above board here and that the details will be forthcoming in due course. For, how could you hope to fight another referendum any time soonall that money had been spent on something   And how could you expect any of your members to dig deep again in the absence of any receipts The absence of anything resembling an independence Plan B has irked many supporters who have begun to question the SNP leadershiprsquos authentic commitment to the project.

Our role is to amply the amazing work already being done across the world to transform the economy. This is not a step into the unknown we know the sort of changes we need to make.With the rest of her time Dr Trebeck, who has more than eight years of experience as a researcher and policy wonk with Oxfam GB, supports WEAll Scotland, just one of several geographic hubs.ldquoThese hubs are local manestations of the global effort. Other hubs are bubbling up, including WEAll Canada ndash thatrsquos particularly nice as they get to call themselves lsquoWe All Canrsquo.This global approach allows WEAll members to operate collaboratively across many dferent sectors ndash not in silos but working together to try to transform the economic system.ldquoThe wellbeing economy is an agenda that, at its most basic, is about pursuing social justice on a healthy planet, says Dr Trebeck. ldquoIt comes from a recognition that,we donrsquot transform how the economy operates ndash who wins, who loses out of the economic system, how we price things, what we incentivise, how businesses operate, how we build our infrastructure ndash we wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.For Dr Trebeck, who has a PhD in Political Science and is Senior Visiting Researcher University of Strathclyde and a Distinguished Fellow of the Schumacher Institute, WEAll is about working with a wide range of partners, friends and allies to think about what can be done, what needs to be done more and what constitutes good practice.ldquoItrsquos about how can we learn from that, she says. ldquoItrsquos about taking a good, hard look at the purpose of the economic system. What are the goals we set ourselves  How do we judge the economy  What are our measures of progress Against a backdrop that has seen UK GDP shrink a record . per cent in the second quarter and plunge the country into its largest recession on record, she points out a wellbeing economy will only ever have been achievedwe have delivered environmental sustainability, addressed climate breakdown and regenerated our environment.She says itrsquos not viable to carry on with how things have been done in the past, adding: ldquoThat was already taking us into some catastrophic terrain and wersquore already seeing the impacts. As an Australian, Irsquom still heartbroken from watching my country burning up last summer. Carrying on with business as usual is not okay.At the heart of the wellbeing economy are issues of environmental protection and social justice and Dr Trebeck feels much of our environmental breakdown has social injustice at its root cause: with huge levels of inequality driving huge amounts of consumption and hence emissions, especially by the very wealthy.ldquoTherersquos been a lot of work been done to demonstrate these links and also how inequality undermines political mobilisation on these issues. So we see itrsquos those countries that are less unequal that are more likely to be more proactive on addressing environmental issues.ldquoThe environmental crisis is a social justice issue and the two of those are bound up in how we design our economics. If we transform the economy towards a wellbeing economy, this will help us deliver on the social justice side of things and on the environment.Dr Trebeck believes therersquos a lot the world can learn from Scotland. ldquoThe global movement has its eyes on whatrsquos happening here and people have taken notice of our agenda. Theyrsquore looking to Scotland for leadership on these issues and are excited by some of the flagship statements and policies but also now saying: lsquoOkay, letrsquos see this add up to something powerful. Letrsquos see those tentative steps become something really concrete.rsquoldquoI think Scotland also needs to learn from whatrsquos going on around the world, so therersquos movement in both directions and collaboration in terms of learning, inspiration and hope.ldquoItrsquos important that Scotland has shown leadership in reaching out and learning from friends around the world rather than competing and seeing the whole world as a sort of zero-sum game.Dr Trebeck points to the fact Scotland is the instigator and holder of the secretariat for the Wellbeing Economy Governmentspartnership ndash a partnership with New Zealand, Iceland and Wales. This was set up to enable governments to collaborate, share and learn from each other, considering collective wellbeing questions around protecting the environment and how to put this at the heart of economic policy making.It paints an optimistic and compelling picture but can it really make a dference to Earth Overshoot Day, pushing back the date when we have exhausted naturersquos budget for the year  ldquoNot yet! However I think Scotland has taken steps in the right direction. We have the seeds of the changes we need to be bringing in.ldquoBusiness has played a huge role in transformation and building a wellbeing economy. Scotland has a good track record in supporting the sort of business models most aligned with this. Things like cooperatives, community interest companies and benefit corporations are emerging in Scotland. And thatrsquos another example where wersquove taken tentative steps in the right direction. I think we just need to breathe more le into them with much more vigour, more oomph.ldquoI sometimes say to my colleagues: lsquoScotland is awake but shersquos still hiding under the coversrsquo.

A signicant moment for the City and an opportunity to bring momentum to one of the most pressing challenges we face: climate change.But  had dferent ideas. In the blink of an eye, the pandemic has turned the world on its head and reminded us of how fragile society and our economy can be.While COVID- and the climate emergency are distinct crises, they resemble each other in three key respects: they are truly global problems, just like viruses, carbon emissions care little for borders both threaten to impact our poorest communities disproportionately and each demands coordinated action of a magnitude not usually seen in peacetime.This is not to say that as iniduals, we cannot do our bit. From donning our protective facemasks and observing social distancing to recycling more and leaving the car in the garage for short journeysndash all of us have a part to play and each of our choices makes a dference.Nevertheless, global challenges require a global response and it falls to governments and institutions to lead the way. While we continue to make progress in the fight against climate change ndash last year, for instance, more of the UKrsquos electricity production came from zero carbon energy sources than fossil fuels for the first time ndash Earth Overshoot Day, the moment when our demand for ecological resources exceeds what nature can regenerate this year, reminds us of the scale of the challenge that remains.At University of Glasgow we recognise that given the scientic and academic expertise at our disposal, and as a world-changing centre of educational and research excellence, we have a duty to lead from the front.That is why in  we became the first UK university to commit to fully disinvesting from fossil fuels. Why in , we signed the Sustainable Development Goals Accord, committing us, amongst other things, to combatting climate change and environmental degradation. And why last May, we became the first Scottish university to declare a climate emergency.Since then we have been developing Glasgow Green, the Universityrsquos Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. In the final stages of production, this document commits us to the ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by .We understand that meeting this target will be challenging. It will require further concerted action across the University, buy-in from students, staff and our wider community, a review of current practices ndash including the frequency of international travel, the leveraging of assets such as the Centre for Sustainable Solutions, gold standard carbon offsetting and signicant investment in greening our estate, at a time when resources across higher education are under strain. But it is achievable. And, more importantly, it is the socially responsible thing to do.Recent times have shown all of us what rapid change feels like and, just as signicantly, the clout required to make it happen. In applying these lessons to the climate emergency, it is clear universities are among the handful of organisations with the reach, expertise and resource base to affect real and impactful change.To evidence this you only need to look at the pivotal role Scotlandrsquos universities have played in the fight against COVID-, via vaccine development, world-leading research and the deployment of staff and students to the NHS frontline. As we look to the future, we must ensure that our response to tackling the climate emergency is similarly robust and wide ranging.Working in concert with partners from industry, the third sector, local and national government, the University of Glasgow is determined to continue to play our part in tackling the environmental crisis ndash both in terms of reducing our own carbon footprint and by acting as a centre for ideas, initiatives and innovative research which will help accelerate Scotlandrsquos transition towards becoming a low-carbon economy, particularly as we build back from the pandemic.The environmental crisis remains one of the most pressing issues we face. Earth Overshoot Day is an opportunity for all of us to take stock on what we are doing, and what more might be done, to help move the date.----------------------------------------Centre shows the Universityrsquos desire to be part of the solutionBy ProfessorJaime L. Toney,Director of the Centre for Sustainable SolutionsThe University of Glasgowrsquos Centre for Sustainable Solutions was established in April  to respond to the climate crisis and enhance the growing ambition for the University and its community to be part of the solution.The centre demonstrates the University of Glasgowrsquos commitment to playing an active role in preventing Earthrsquos temperature rising above the .degC threshold defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The centre also recognises the social, cultural, and geopolitical complexities related to the climate emergency. The only way to manage these challenges is for multiple sectors and disciplines to come together to reduce our reliance on carbon, support the social implications of that, and #movethedateBehaviour, choices, and systems must be addressed to enable change, innovation, and sustainability. The centre is dedicated to undertaking activities that will enable iniduals, communities and organisations to act towards a sustainable future through education, research, and partnership.In education, the centre is using the universityrsquos academic expertise to educate the next generation of climate and carbon literate students who are capable of critically engaging with climate and carbon challenges.We are creating bespoke courses that are accessible to all staff and students. We are aligning our work with wider partner initiatives, such as those of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society who have created climate solutions modules for business management, and Education Scotland who are developing primary and secondary education policy in this area.We aim to ensure a common message, language and understanding of the challenges we face and choices that will lead to solutions.The centre seeks out our vocal and engaged student community, finding ways to raise their collective voice. We are proud to support the tremendous effort of the coalition of students and societies who joined together to form the lsquoGlasgow Green New Dealrsquo and spent six months producing a strategic document on priority areas and practices of change that has fed into our University Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan.We work closely with the Glasgow University Environmental Sustainability Teamwho are a team of highly motivated and professional students employed by the university to work on improving the environmental practice of the university. The sustainability agenda is rooted within the core values of our students we recognise them as partners and essential drivers of change for an equitable, as well as sustainable future of our one planet.The Centre for Sustainable Solutions is raising the visibility of research related to environmental sustainability, climate change and the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goals across the University of Glasgow through our website and social media to reach out and make synergistic connections with collaborators and partner organisations.The centre is partnering with Glasgow City Council and Policy Scotland this autumn to mobilise iniduals and organisations through a structured series of dialogues which will inform and encourage partnership to achieve the cityrsquos ambitious target of net zero by .Through the dialogues we will identy common issues and innovate potential solutions, paving the way for collective impact on challenges posed by climate change.This week, the Global Footprint Network, which leads the Earth Overshoot Day initiative, is focusing on changing the climate trend and #movethedate by reducing population growth through empowering women.Researchers at the University of Glasgow are committed to empowering women and girls to be equal partners through work on understanding and ending violence against women, for example in Brazil and El Salvador, work aimed at changing policies and practices that lead to gendered health inequalities, and reducing gender inequalities in the global south, including understanding trajectories of women in STEM disciplines from higher education into employment.The centre is a new venture but growing quickly in response to the urgency of the issues we face. We are motivated by the enthusiasm of partners in and beyond the University and welcome the participation of others interested in contributing to our work. We embrace the Scottish ethos focused on inclusion, where the sustainable and just transition are synonymous.We intend to find creative and explicit ways to be inclusive by drawing on the erse range of expertise across and beyond the University to ensure we address the multi-faceted and complicated challenge of sustainability that has never been more urgent than it is today.---------------------------------------Students demand action that reflects their climate fearsBy Amy McKenzie Smith, Vice President of Student Activities, University of GlasgowFor students, therersquos a real sense that universities have a duty to be leaders and drivers of change in society. If you ask a student ldquowhat do you want from your university, you will hear obvious answers such as ldquoa decent educationrsquo, ldquoa global reputationrsquo or ldquoexcellent job prospects.Yet, you would struggle to find a student who doesnrsquot also expect their institution to place strong values at the forefront of its mission students want their university to demonstrate ethical standardsthat align with their own.One of those core values for many students across the UK right now is caring about the environment and sustainability, something students want universities to take a lead in addressing.Universities have always been a melting pot of activism and Glasgow is no dferent.Over the past year alone we have seen many student campaigns these included a coalition called the lsquoGlasgow Green New Dealrsquo, which set out a -page document detailing exactly how they want their University to tackle climate change.This clearly demonstrates the studentsrsquo desire for rapid progress on this issue.Students donrsquot just expect universities to be at the helm of research but also to act on the findings of that research.Part of the thinking here is thatuniversities donrsquot operate in sustainable ways, then how can we expect industry, government and society in general to do so either.When looking back over the last year, itrsquos dficult to recall anything apart from COVID- and its massive impact on our lives.But we shouldnrsquot forget that in January, Australia was experiencing record-breaking temperatures and one of its worst ever bushfires, destroying an area the size of South Korea.We should also remember the turn of the year, which witnessed one of the biggest climate strikes to date many students in Glasgow and across the U.K. turned out to show their dismay at the lack of action by political leaders.In many ways, COVID- has heightened the discourse on climate change ndash something that is especially on our minds as we approach Earth Overshoot Day.We now have a golden opportunity to reposition and restart the lsquogreen revolutionrsquondash a small silver lining when considering the awful pandemic that has taken over the world.There are not many instances,any, in modern human history where the planet has lsquopausedrsquo now, as and when normal le resumes, many students want their institutions to do things dferently.The way we recover from COVID- is incredibly important. COP in November  could be a pivotal moment for the planet ndash and for universities, it will be a fantastic opportunity to influence public thinking, harnessing the enthusiasm of our students and staff alike.Students expect the University of Glasgow to take a leading role in COP and show it can live up to its reputation as a world-leading, world-changing University.With the worldrsquos eyes on Glasgow, students want their alma mater to put climate change at the heart of its agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"orkney-cluster-new-positive-covid-19-case-cluster-linked-fishing-vessel","story":"A new case was confirmed on Friday afternoon, with the incident management team meeting to discuss progress with contact tracing across NHS Highland, NHS Grampian and NHS Orkney.It was revealed on Thursday that a fishing boat from Peterhead was the subject of an outbreak of the virus in Orkney, with the local health chief saying he was concernedthat the virus was spreading quickly across the island community.:Positive Covid- case confirmed at Gfnock restaurant as customers urged to be aware of symptomsNHS Orkney chief executive Michael Dickson said on Thursday a number of people had developed symptoms and then travelled to their homes across Orkney and to mainland Scotland.A cluster of five positive cases was identied on Thursday, with a further one being confirmed on Friday.NHS Orkney Director of Public Health Louise Wilson said: ldquoWeaskthe Orkney community tocontinue following thephysical distancing guidelines.:Orkney: Five positive cases as coronavirus spreads lsquorapidlyrsquo\"Anyone who develops symptoms shouldself-isolate and contact NHS Orkney for a test.ldquoThis is no time to be complacentbut we canprevent therisk of thevirusspreading furtherwe allfollow the FACTS guidance."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-leads-tributes-veterans-ahead-vj-day-events","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said people should be inspired by the ldquoidealism of those who fought in the war and commit to creating a ldquobetter, fairer and more peaceful world.Saturday marks  years since Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on August  , ending hostilities.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were due to take part in a private service of remembrance and thanksgiving and then lead a national two-minute silence at am in honour of those who lost their lives in the war.Read more: Bravery of Victoria Cross hero who was last man standing on battlefield remembered  years onThe Red Arrows are also due to fly over Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardf and London - the first time such a flight has taken place since the  Olympic and Paralympic Games.Scotlandrsquos Veterans Minister Graeme Dey will join a number of former and serving members of the armed forces to observe a two-minute silence on the steps of St Andrews House, the Scottish Government building in Edinburgh.Legion Scotland is holding an online service of remembrance and a concert.Ahead of the anniversary commemorations, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIt was on this date in  that the conflict in the Far East ended and World War Two came to a close.ldquoIn marking the th anniversary of VJ Day, we remember everyone - the soldiers and civilians on all sides - who paid the ultimate price during the conflict.ldquoWe think of those who served in the armed forces - from across Scotland, the UK, the Commonwealth and the other allied nations.ldquoWe remember the pain and suffering of those who spent years in prisoner of war camps.ldquoAnd we reflect on all those who contributed to the war effort on the home front - and the sacrices they made.ldquoTogether, they ensured the freedoms that we enjoy today.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide. All of this is built on the learnings from trials undertaken as part of G RuralFirst, a Cisco-led DCMS G Trials and Testbed programme.Chief Executive, Cisco UK  Ireland, David Meads, said: “Our findings with G RuralFirst revealed that over a ten-year period, the UK’s rural economy could grow by an additional £ bngood quality G services were accessible.“We believe that by taking advantage of neutral hosting technologies, fixed wireless access and spectrum sharing, we will be able to allow third parties – including local businesses and communities – to build and own radio infrastructure, as well as work with mobile network operators to reduce costs and make rural coverage commercially sustainable.”Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Warman, said: #We are making sure the UK#s rural communities aren’t left behind in the digital age and are investing record amounts to improve connectivity in the least connected parts of the country.“G New Thinking is part of our £ million programme to help the countryside capitalise on new ways of using next generation G technology and I look forward to seeing how rural communities will benefit.#The project is expected to go live later in  and to conclude in .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, teachers and other staff will have to maintain a distance from the children, while working hard to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.In a staggered approach, helmed by Orkney Islands Council, bairns have begun toto school, today, while pre-schools and nurseries are expected to resume, next week.As we caught up with some of the parents and pupils on this morning#s school route, #nervous but excited# was the phrase on most people#s lips. While children are happy to be reunited with their friends and teachers, and parents are pleased to see ato routine for their little ones, some admitted that they were just a peedie bit nervous about how it would all go.As Scotland remains in Phase Three of the lockdown exit route, the threat of coronavirus is still very much in the minds of us all. But OIC has assured parents that rigorous measures have been taken to help keep children and staff safe.The council has put together a Frequently Asked Questions list to help answer the common queries and concerns of parents and carers.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

Dreams have been shattered, places at top universities have been scrapped and young people have fallen victim to this complete farce of a model that Mr Weir and Mr Edwards have been dodging questions on since Thursday.I should not be a victim of historical data. I should not be downgraded because I chose integrated education rather than a grammar school.Our school prides itself on every pupil achieving their personal best.Does your model take this into consideration I deserve to be treated as an inidual. The modelling that has been used must be open to question and scrutiny, because it does not seem to reflect the actual student.It is more of an exercise in statistics far too much about the modelling is hidden and too many young people have been let down.Had a fire alarm gone off during our exams we#d all have been awarded our predicted grades.We#re going through a global pandemic, which is much more distressing, and thousands of young people have suffered because of this mess, fuelled by the decisions taken by Mr Edwards and Mr Weir.I have % trust in my teachers. Why don#t you Your model should be withdrawn, just like thousands of Ucas offers were withdrawn on Friday.Justin Edwards and Peter Weir, you have failed so many of us and robbed us of the grades we deserved.I hope you both take a long, hard look at yourselves and perhaps just stop to think about this absolute shambles you have created and all those dreams you have shattered in the process.Think about it aswe were your children and it was their futures at stake.Jamie Harkin is head boy at Drumragh Integrated School in Omagh  Belfast   Most ReadBallymena cafe workerdies after contracting Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Death of womanconfirmed as new Covid- cases surge by Top Northern Ireland businessman Hugh McWilliams dies in Draperstown road crashBallycastle tractor crash tragedy: Miracle as five-year-old Hannah Smyth s home after three months in hospitalDeveloper withdraws £m Belfast apart-hotel proposal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

was up on previous years.However, many students have been left shocked and disappointed after receiving grades that were signicantly lower than both their performance in previous exams and their teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said Mr Weir. branded the situation a lsquodebaclersquo \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland daf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news

acknowledged that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading. Many students across Northern Ireland feel robbed of a fair chance. It is not good enough.The Minister for Education and Joint First Ministers must be held to account. pic qsiKOSGK— Social Democratic and Labour PartyAugust , Daniel McCrossan, whose SDLP has urged the Assembly recall, branded the situation a “debacle”.He expressed concern about the mental health impact on children, revealing that a GP had contacted him to alert him that three pupils who had missed out on university places had presented with suicidal thoughts.“This model failed, it failed our children and it failed our young people,” he told the minister.He added: “As the result of this pandemic, they should not pay the price.”Mr McCrossan demanded more transparency on the algorithm used to calculate the grades.In regard to the algorithm, Mr McCrossan said there was a need to “mark the minister’s homework”.Mr Weir said he would make information on the formula public, though he stressed some of it would be technical data.He rejected calls for an independent review of CCEA’s actions.“I think CCEA processes were sound,” he said.“I don’t intend at this stage to have an independent review.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  Chief executive of CCEA Justin Edwards also faced questions at the committee.He defended the model used, insisting a range of academics and other experts were involved in its development.Mr Edwards stressed the limited time his organisation had to deliver on the minister’s key objectives – to produce a set of results for the  cohort and to ensure standards were in line with previous years.“People have worked inordinate hours in my organisation to deliver a solution,” he said.Mr Edwards added: “I’ve always cited that the best solution was examinations and it was not available to us.“And,it was not available to us, then this alternative approach was the next best operation.”He claimed no better solution had been presented.“If there was a viable alternative to this situation, then let it be brought forward,” he said.PAMost ReadBallymena cafe workerdies after contracting Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Death of womanconfirmed as new Covid- cases surge by Top Northern Ireland businessman Hugh McWilliams dies in Draperstown road crashBallycastle tractor crash tragedy: Miracle as five-year-old Hannah Smyth s home after three months in hospitalDeveloper withdraws £m Belfast apart-hotel proposal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their knowledge of the sea correctly pinpointed the girls# trajectory across Galway Bay and outwards towards the Atlantic.Last night Ellen remained in hospital for another night but said she was feeling good.I#m grand. I was on an adrenaline high . It#s starting to wear off now, but I#m fine, she added.Ellen stressed that throughout the nightmare ordeal, her primary thoughts were of her loved ones.At the very, very beginning I was thinking, #Oh my God, I#m going to die#, she said.But then we were pretty sure we would be okay.We had to be calm and stay positive, but the big worry we had was our parents were going to think we had drowned.I kept saying to myself, #Oh my God, I hope my granny doesn#t know#.I sat there in the ocean and was saying over and over, #Mum, I#m okay. Mum, I#m safe. Mum, I#m going to come home and I#m going to be fine#.When I saw her and was finally talking to her, she said, #I just knew you were going to be okay. I was telling everyone you were completely fine#.I was literally sending her mind messages.Minutes after she heard that Ellen and Sarah were alive, Deirdre, Ellen#s mum, said she never gave up hope of seeing her daughter again.I just felt the whole time in my gut that she was okay. She is so level-headed and calm and strategic in her thinking that I just knew, she explained.I really did think that she was just swept into a cave. I said to myself that she would have deflated the board, wrapped it around them and waited until morning.I thought we would meet her walking along the road somewhere. In my gut I knew she was okay. She#s tough.Despite rough sea conditions, the cousins managed to fall asleep on their boards for a few seconds at a time. When they awoke the waves were huge - they were splashing on us.For a while that was scary, but we were able to stay on the boards, Ellen said.When the sun came up, the girls could make out the Clfs of Moher and Inis Oirr.Realising the waves could push them out into the Atlantic, they paddled furiously to reach the island, but the waves were too high.Just as exhaustion was proving too much, the buoy of a lobster pot appeared and they realised that they could tether themselves to it.We tied our boards to it and then took turns to sleep on our boards, Ellen said. In hindsight, it is weird that we just stayed so calm. We just thought, #We can#t drt out there#, and didn#t expand on it.Ellen used the strap from her paddleboard to clip their boards onto the buoy and tied the boards together using leashes attached to each board.When we weren#t paddling, we were holding on to each other#s board, she explained.One day on from their dramatic rescue, Ellen is overwhelmed by the kindness shown to her and Sarah by everyone who had been searching for them, especially rescuers Patrick and Morgan.I was saying to them, #Oh my God, are you ourangels  We have been out here since last night and nobody has even come looking for us#. I thought that they were just out fishing.They said, #No, there are at least  boats out looking for you#. They were so lovely to us. They were so good.They wrapped us up completely, covered us with heavy blankets. They gave us drinks.My hand was sticking out and heput it in through the sleeve of one of their jumpers, so I was completely covered and warm.We#re just so grateful to everyone.Galway United held a minute#s applause at their game at home to Longford Town last night as a gesture of thanks towards those who played a role in the rescue of Ellen, daughter of club star Johnny.Johnny was a former striker for Galway United and has a role at the club as head of youth development.Galway United#s vice president Bernie O#Connell said the rescue of the two young women had given Galway a huge lt and compared it to winning an All-Ireland final.Mr O#Connell, a family friend of the Glynns, added: People in Galway and indeed Ireland are overwhelmed with joy at the rescue of Sarah and Ellen.It is absolutely wonderful news and everyone is just so relieved.It was like winning the FAI Cup or an All-Ireland... people are just over the moon.It was a remarkable conclusion to a harrowing experience for the family.

The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families. The failure of CCEA to remove the contentiousstandardisation from the grading process and the subsequent failure of the Education Minister to act has compounded that stress. It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out.

All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks.

Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen.

If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there.

All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

Since nobody is happy with the system the planners could argue that they must have got the balance right, but a report into planning in Northern Ireland recently published by Queen’s University and Cardf University found that roughly % of people using the system believe that it does not look after the public interest, and that only % of citizens using the system feel that their views are taken into account — so something is very wrong. One might start by asking why we have planning at all.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Marcus Patton is an artist and architectWhen the modern planning system was introduced after the war in  its main priority was to stimulate redevelopment of areas that had been damaged by bombing, and to build an infrastructure that would revive the economy. In England that was counterbalanced by the introduction of the system of listed buildings and recognition that there should be a balance between development and the protection of amenity.In Northern Ireland we got the development bit, but listed buildings were not provided for until , and the preliminary survey of our historic buildings was not completed till around . In the meantime we had the Troubles and many of our buildings were damaged or demolished before they could even be considered for listing. With that on top of the usual depredations of developers and roads engineers what has been left is particularly precious to us. It could be argued that in the present day, far from stimulating development, the planning system should be there primarily to protect our environment and to deal with climate change. Developers will always want to develop, andthey are prevented from developing one area they will move to another. If planners stick to their guns in protecting conservation areas and listed buildings, developers will turn their attentions to less salubrious areas where their investment could be genuinely beneficial. Unfortunately we have a system which clogs up development by trying to tweak it instead of refusing it outright when it is inappropriate and yet which eventually approves some % of applications. So essentially we have a bureaucratic system which ultimately rubber stamps almost everything put in front of it. On the rare occasions when an application is refused the applicant can withdraw it and try again with some modications, or he can appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission, where over % of appeals are successful and the planners are overruled. One curiosity of the planning system is that while the developer has this right of appeal, a person living beside the development - who it might be argued is more signicantly affectedby it than the developer is — has no such right. While you wouldn’t want the planning system to be clogged up with vexatious appeals about minor alterations, the householder who finds a tower block going up at the end of his street has a genuine grievance — and it is one that will be shared by many others. Third party right of appeal — as this redress is called — exists in many parts of Europe, including Ireland, but not in the UK whose systems we generally follow. It seems a natural balance of legal rights to give the people affected the same rights as the perpetrator, particularly when the appeal is supported by environmental groups acting purely in the public interest. Planning often came in for criticism when it was carried out by the centralised DoE with a series of codes and standards that were applied unormly across the province. But we now have a dozen planning authorities, with each council devising its own iation on planning codes. Add to that the role of councillors who may be lobbied by developers, and council officers who are anxious to increase potential rates income and attract businesses to their area, and we have a recipe for bargain-basement planning. There are of course councillors who support their constituents in trying to protect the environment, but too often they are a small minority. The recent case ofthe Westminster housing secretary Robert Jenrick overruling a local council to grant permission for a multi-million pound scheme by a Tory donor shows how easily even a government minister can be persuaded to make decisions that favour wealthy developers rather than protect the interest of people living in an area..We need a planning system that protects the environment, is not afraid to refuse unsuitable applications, and enforces breaches of planning law promptly and fearlessly. If it is a toothless bureaucracy then there is very little point in having it. If you have a planning system — and most people would agree that there should be one — it must be seen to be fair and to act in the public interest. It is not easy, but our planners should not allow the degradation of our built or natural heritages, should not pander to developers, and should valiantly seek to make Northern Ireland a better place in which to live and work. • Marcus Patton is an artist and architect——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...But when the News Letter asked the two leadersthey could clearly condemn the harsh Hong Kong law or the Chinese government’s appalling treatment of the Uighur Muslim population and the persecution of other minorities such as Christians, there was silence.Ultimately, the consulate amended its report to remove the claim – but with no explanation as to what had gone on.As that story broke on Tuesday, China’s Belfast consulate was featured in The Times for another reason. The paper’s legal editor reported how the consulate was claiming diplomatic immunity to enable it to build ‘the great wall of Belfast’ around its building – despite that being in clear contravention of planning law. The Times noted that theHigh Court had rejected an injunction application from Belfast City Council on the grounds that diplomatic immunity effectively allowed the consulate to do almost as it liked while remaining immune from legal action.Both incidents highlight a problem which has been festering for almost a decade since Stormont began strategically attempting to impress the Chinese government.In common with many countries, Stormont’sleaders were persuaded to court China for one overwhelming reason: Its growing wealth.With Northern Ireland slow to emerge from the global recession, civil servants, politicians and senior business figures saw that even securing a tiny slice of China’s multiplying prosperity could be transformative to a small region like Northern Ireland.But there were always going to be awkward strings attached to getting close toauthoritarian rulers who lock up their internal critics,persecute religiousminorities, censor the internet and have scant respect for free speech.Whereas in  Peter Robinson was meeting Chinese Christian leaders and referring bluntly to “the persecution suffered by those who are barred from practising their faith by the ruling communist regime”, two years later he and other Stormont ministers were respectfully referring to “the Chinese government” and past criticisms had become muted.Where in the past the Dalai Lama had been welcomed to Stormont with open arms, now the first and deputy first ministers could not find time to meet him when he was in Northern Ireland.In fact, a source with knowledge of events eight years ago said that the breakthrough in the relationship – the powerful Madam Liu Yandong’s visit to Belfast in  – had been a direct reward for Stormont’s decision not to meet the Dali Lama.An inidual present on one of several ministerial visits to China that Martin McGuinness did in passing bring up “in an awkward and almost apologetic way” an elliptical reference to China’s appallinghuman rights abuses – but in a way which appeared to be designed to allow Sinn Féin to say at home that they had done so, rather than as a meaningful attempt to impress his views on senior Communist Party figures.Five years ago the executive approved a ‘China Strategy’ – a demonstration of the unusual effort the devolved administration was focussing on the country.Jonathan Bell, first as a junior minister and then as Enterprise Minister, became avidly enthusiastic about promoting links with China. The former DUP minister seemed to be incessantly flying to China where he appeared to develop high-level connections.Both he and Mr Robinson received honorary professorships from a Chinese university and Mr Bellwas given more than £, as a gt fromChina’s vice-president, something he donated toone of the few aspects of the China-Northern Ireland relationship which was not explicitly about cash, the Confucius Institute at Ulster University which works to strengthen ties with China and to promote Chinese language and culture.A decade ago, the Confucius Institute was described by the then senior Chinese propagandist and Politburo member Li Changchun as “part of China’s foreign propaganda strategy” but ministers embraced it uncritically.In a submission to the first and deputy first minister ahead of their trip to China in , senior official Tim Losty –who since  had been Stormont’s man in Beijing – told them that the purpose of the visit was “to create a relationship with the Chinese government that will assist in enhanced trade, increased investment, increasing the number of Chinese students in NI, creating access to research programmes and funding, enhancing NI’s national brand reputation and contributing to global issues”.\u2028Sections of the submission were blacked out when released to this newspaper, but in more than  pages of legible text there was no evidence of Stormont even considering the potential trade-off it was making – essentially silence on human rights abuses in exchange for material benefits.Politicians and civil servants will argue that as a devolved administration without responsibility for foreign policy, such matters are beyond their ambit, and that China would takeno regard of their views anyway.But that is a deeply imperfect answer. Council chambers and the assembly spend hours debating international relations – whether Israel, foreign wars or US actions – far beyond their responsibilities.And our politicians once did condemn the Chinese government, recognising that to do so was fundamentally dferent to condemning the people of a proud civilisation which over thousands of years has given the world cultural and creative wealth.Northern Ireland is now facing a recession perhaps more terrible than anything ever seen in the modern era and there is a utilitarian argument that queasiness about Uighur Muslims being forcibly sterilised and taken to concentration camps, or iniduals being arrested in Hong Kong for carrying quotes from the Bible, should be set aside and our leaders should simply focus on doing what they can for the people of Northern Ireland.Butthat is Stormont’s strategy, should it not face up to what it is doing  Mammon and morality are uneasy bedfellows.This week showed the dangers into which our leaders are stumbling because even when judged on purely pragmatic grounds, perceivedsubservience to China could be damaging inotherregions.The furore over the Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill’s alleged comments was widely reported in Hong Kong, a major financial centre, and will also have been fed back to Washington, a big investor now increasingly at iance with Beijing.With a pandemic raging and Brexit looming, politicians and civil servants have limited time for fresh challenges. But either continuing the current strategy or altering it will have major implications.________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
