Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027    Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.

I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children          Last month when Mel revealed she was heading for rehab for PTSD, she admitted she was struggling to deal with her emotions - which lead her to seek solace in booze and sex.

It claims Sir Lynton, who ran Boris Johnson’s two successful London mayoral campaigns – and is reportedly backing his bid to oust Mrs May – dismissed the strategy as ‘bull****’.Mr Timothy and Miss Hill were forced to quit after the election.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election. It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.’           The double agent (pictured) said that the Labour leader was an informant for the KGB  MI6 chiefs were so concerned about Michael Foot\u0027s (pictured, right) alleged links to the KGB that they were prepared to pass information onto the Queen  (pictured, left, in 1982) The journalist also revealed that the information was ‘too politically incendiary’ to show to Margaret Thatcher.The allegations made against Mr Foot were detailed in a 400-page file labelled ‘Agent Boot’.The word ‘agent’ is believed to have been later crossed out when Mr Foot was demoted to a ‘confidential contact’. The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky. The spy claimed he met Mr Jones for lunch, but found him ‘absolutely useless’ as a contact.Mr Gordievsky became a double-agent for MI6 in the 1970s, later rising to be head of the KGB’s London station in the early 1980s. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/21/502EA8EE00000578-0-image-a-8_1536956954358.jpg","title":"Waitrose ditch 5p carrier bags spring 2019","story":"    Waitrose will stop offering small plastic bags for loose fruit and veg and stop offering 5p throwaway carrier bags at tills in a new move against plastic waste (stock picture)Hatched among the waste: Swan forced to build a nest out of...Fast food drinks face 25p tax as government looks to extend...Share this articleConventional plastic bags for fresh produce are being replaced a version made from corn starch that are home compostable and rot down without the need for any specialist treatment or high temperatures.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners will initially remove 5p bags from six shops from October 8, at Saxmundham, Gerrards Cross, Keynsham, Dorking, Newark and East Putney, to understand how to manage the changeover, ahead of their complete removal in March 2019.Historically, the money raised from the sale of 5p carrier bags has been given to good causes.

But not any more.Now, one of the country’s top psychologists and behavioural geneticists, Professor Robert Plomin, of King’s College London, offers an emphatic conclusion.It is drawn from 45 years of research and hundreds of studies. He says the single most important factor in each and every one of us — the very essence of our iniduality — is our genetic make-up, our DNA.The basic building blocks of life that we inherit from our parents are what determine who we are — not how much they loved us, read us books or which school they sent us to.DNA accounts for at least half the variance in people’s psychological traits, much more than any other single factor. Put simply, ‘nature’ trumps ‘nurture’ every time, and not just marginally, but by a long, long chalk.Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits — from how tall we are to how much we weigh — but also to our intelligence and our psychology, from a tendency to depression to having resilience and grit.          Our DNA, fixed and unchangeable, determines whether we have a predisposition not just to physical traits but also to our psychologyPlomin’s revolutionary conclusion — outlined in a challenging and thought-provoking new book, Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are — is a game-changer, he claims, with far-reaching implications for psychology and for society.He turns much conventional thinking on its head, controversially calling into question many basic assumptions, such as the value of formal education to change people’s lives.It also undermines the parenting advice industry, the basis of all those groaning shelves of manuals telling us the right way to bring up our children and the disasters that will ensue if we get it wrong.These sell because every parent wants to think they can make a difference to their child, that they can help him or her with reading and arithmetic or teach them how to be kind or conscientious. But, says Plomin, there’s no hard evidence that this is true.On the contrary, our ability to read, to learn, to empathise and so on are all ruled primarily by our genes.Kate\u0027s mission to rescue kids at risk: Duchess of Cambridge...She\u0027s been criticised for taking a stance. But in a personal...Share this articleBeing a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNA.The raw material of our natural selves is what overwhelmingly determines what we can — and cannot — achieve, not how we are brought up. And all those parenting books that promise to deliver developmental outcomes for children are, he maintains, merely ‘peddling snake oil’.If Plomin is right — and he offers an impressive array of research over many years — then dear old Philip Larkin was a grumpy old man not because of his upbringing, but because that tendency was in the genetic blueprint he was born with. The good news, of course, is that his huge talent came from the same source.Chicago-born Plomin’s startling conclusions come from two of his long-term studies. Over the course of 40 years, he tracked 250 adopted children in Colorado along with the birth parents who gave them their genes, and the adoptive parents who raised them. After moving to London in 1994, he launched a 20-year study of more than 12,000 pairs of twins.From these studies, it was possible to unravel the relative importance of genes as opposed to environment when it came to their development.          Being a tiger mum (or dad) and laying down a strict regime of learning won’t be of the slightest use unless those tendencies already exist in the child’s DNAMillions of pieces of data were amassed from the parents, teachers and the children themselves, about psychological traits such as hyperactivity and inattention, talents such as school achievement and the ability to learn languages, and physical characteristics, such as the propensity to put on weight and become obese.From all this, he found overwhelming evidence that adopted children are similar to their birth parents, not the parents who raised them. Identical twins (ie, from a single egg and therefore with the same DNA) develop much more similarly to each other as compared with non-identical twins (from separate eggs and with different DNA).The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn out.Even stressful life events such as relationship break-ups, financial difficulties and illness don’t have the impact that people generally assume.          The conclusion was clear — DNA makes us who we are. In the long term, the environment you grow up in has little impact on the way you turn outIn fact, what really matters in such situations is our genes, because it is our genes that determine how well or badly an inidual deals with such setbacks. And whether we’re resilient to life’s catastrophes or cave in is determined by our DNA, too.Take orce. Even though the children in a family are all affected, how each inidual deals with it often differs. It is often harder on one sibling than the other(s) — and that difference is because of their different DNA.In fact, Plomin argues, there are genetic influences in virtually everything we do. Those differences determine how we perceive and interpret the world we grow up in, and how we modify our behaviour accordingly.In school, genetic differences in children’s aptitudes and interests, inherited from their parents, affect the extent to which they take advantage of educational opportunities. Similarly, genetic differences in our vulnerability to depression affect the extent to which we interpret experiences we undergo positively or negatively.          Parents, Plomin insists, need to realise ‘that they are not carpenters building a child from scratch‘We can try to force our dreams on them, that they become, for example, a world-class pianist or a star athlete. But we are unlikely to be successful unless we go with the genetic grain.’That, though, still leaves an important role for parents — to find out what their children do well and provide the opportunities for them to do it. What we should not do is try to change them into something they are not.‘Each child is their own person genetically. We need to recognise and respect their genetic differences. If we go against the grain, we run the risk of damaging our relationship with them.’This has positives for parents, too, relieving them of the anxiety and guilt piled on them in how-to parenting manuals.‘These can scare us into thinking that one wrong move can ruin a child for ever.’Plomin hopes his findings will ‘free parents from the illusion that a child’s future success depends on how hard they push them’.And the same, he insists, goes for schools — a theory that challenges the principles on which our education system is based.Schools, he says, matter in that they teach basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. They also dispense fundamental information about history, science, maths and culture. But choice of school makes very little difference to a child’s achievement.‘Genetics is by far the major source of inidual differences in school achievement.’This suggests we should ignore all those league tables of exam results and Ofsted ratings. Plomin argues that differences in schools have very little effect on outcome.This conclusion will inevitably trigger a great debate about the comparative merits of selective grammar schools and non-selective comprehensives.On average, GCSE scores for children in selective schools are a grade higher than in non-selective schools, and this difference is usually assumed to be because selective schools provide better schooling. Genetic research, however, shows that if the best pupils are selected according to the abilities they showed at primary school, they’ll inevitably get better GCSE results.This is because of who they are, not what they’ve learned in the classroom or the way they’ve been taught.Those higher grades are simply a self-fulfilling prophecy.Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16.The ‘value added’ — a measure used by many top schools — turns out to be very small.          The influence of our DNA is not completely confined to our early years when we’re growing upThe same principle applies in the debate about private and state schools. If, as Plomin claims, schools have little effect on inidual differences in achievement, then those 7 per cent of parents who pay huge sums to send their children to private schools in the belief that it will give them an advantage may well be wasting their cash.Plomin writes: ‘Expensive schooling cannot survive a cost–benefit analysis on the basis of school achievement itself.’If your genes fit, you’ll do well and, if they don’t, no amount of cash can change the abilities you’re born with.What all schools should aspire to, he maintains, is to be places where children can learn to enjoy learning for its own sake, rather than frenetically teaching pupils to pass the exams that will improve the school’s standing in league tables.Not that the influence of our DNA is confined to our early years when we’re growing up.Indeed, Plomin shows that it gets stronger as we get older. More and more, we revert to type. Yes, other factors impact on us, such as our relationships with partners, children and friends, our jobs and interests. All contribute to give life meaning.But they don’t fundamentally change who we are psychologically — our personality, our mental health and our cognitive abilities. Good and bad things happen to us, but eventually we rebound to our genetic trajectory. Many people, Plomin acknowledges, will be aghast at his ‘bold conclusion’.It seems to make us automatons, devoid of free will, victims of our DNA. And, indeed, this level of determinism could be an excuse for apathy, a refusal to take responsibility for oneself: ‘Not my fault, guv, it’s my genes!’However, he categorically rejects this notion.Just because you have a genetic propensity to put on weight, for example, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try to lose some pounds.You may have the devil inside you, but you can keep it at bay.Plomin found that his own genetic mapping threw up a surprise.‘I am genetically predisposed to put on the pounds and find it hard to lose them.‘It means I can’t let my guard down and, in those weak moments, give in to those siren snacks in the cupboard whispering to me.’          Once you discount genetic factors, generally speaking Plomin said there is little difference between school achievement at age 11 and GCSE results at 16The same applies to anyone with a genetic propensity to depression, learning disabilities or alcohol abuse.‘Genes are not destiny,’ says Plomin. You don’t have to succumb.Controversially, he can see a time soon when DNA information will routinely be on people’s medical records, though he acknowledges that this poses serious dilemmas.Do you want to know if your child has a high genetic risk for schizophrenia when there’s nothing you can do to stop it? On the other hand, he says, many psychological disorders, such as alcohol dependence and anorexia, are difficult to cure.Early warning is good, and preventing problems before they occur is much more cost effective, economically as well as psychologically.It’s also good, he argues, that we can know our limits — those things that our DNA just won’t let happen, however hard we try.Plomin quotes with approval the observation of American comedian W.C. Fields: ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There’s no use being a damn fool about it.’Because, ultimately, it’s more sensible to go with the genetic flow rather than trying to swim upstream.Equally, our DNA can tell us where our inborn talents lie, so that we do not waste them.There was a telling example this week when former England captain Alastair Cook retired from Test cricket. In tribute, commentator Mike Atherton declared: ‘He made himself the best player he could be he extracted every last ounce of his talent.’Plomin’s radical new world may force us to bow to our genetic limits but, on the plus side, it will encourage us, like Alastair Cook, to do the best we can with the talents we’ve been given.Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are by Robert Plomin will be published by Allen Lane on October 4 at £20. © Robert Plomin 2018.

It’s so sad, because he’s missing out on so much.’Part of the problem is, I believe, that even in the 21st century the image of retirement remains firmly stuck in the past. It feels out of sync in a world that places such a high premium on being purposeful and busy — and where being stressed out is not only the norm, but a marker of success.‘We have become so obsessed over the past few decades with working hard and the idea of being a “go-getter” that retirement — because it’s the antithesis of that — is seen as giving up,’ says Ian Stuart-Hamilton, professor of developmental psychology at the University of South Wales.‘There are more than enough role models now of people who are ploughing on long past retirement age, like the U.S. business magnate Warren Buffett, who’s 88.‘The danger is that once you get trapped into that mindset, retirement then seems like a kind of failure.’So what can we do to change that mindset? Today and next week I will explore how we can, with careful planning and honesty about our long-term goals, turn the potential negatives of retirement into positives.I will look at the thorny issues that trouble those about to retire: how and when to take that all-important step reinventing ourselves for the next phase keeping physically and mentally alert and, yes, rekindling our marriages, too.WINDING DOWN OR A LEAP IN THE DARK?TIME was when the decision about how and when to stop work was easy. The retirement age was fixed at 65 for men and 60 for women, and those milestones remained comfortably in the back of your mind for the whole of your working life.But with a change in the law in 2011 abolishing the default retirement age, the certainties have been swept away.In theory, we can all carry on till we drop. Indeed, the numbers choosing to work on after 65 have doubled to a record 1.19 million over the past ten years.So of all the numerous retirement options that now confront us, which one is best?Phased in: reducing your hours gradually by working part- time before leaving? Cliff-edge: stopping work overnight? Portfolio: a mixture of part-time, consultancy, self-employment andor voluntary work?The list goes on. Should I defer my pension? Should I take it as a lump sum, or as an annuity, or drawdown?Retirement has gone from being a single, easy-to-grasp concept to a mind-boggling mixed bag of possibilities.          So why is it that so many people find retirement unbelievably tough?On the face of it, stopping work overnight sounds like a seriously bad idea. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s true that many retirements get off to a bad start when the change is too sudden. Yet the surprising truth is that for others, it works very well.‘You remember that wonderful feeling when you were a child and the summer holidays seemed to stretch in front of you endlessly?’ says Lily, who took early retirement from the Department for Work and Pensions in Sheffield. ‘That’s how I felt the day after I left work.‘It was as though I’d been given a gift. To begin with it felt like annual leave. But after a few weeks came the realisation that I didn’t have to go back. It was wonderful.’The key to making cliff-edge retirement work is preparation, says Chris Phillipson, professor of sociology and social gerontology at Manchester University.‘The assumption that cliff-edge is bad is just that — an assumption,’ he says. ‘It may not be bad if you’re supported, or it may well be very bad if there is no support.’For others, the idea of weaning yourself off work gradually over a period of months or years is more appealing. There are two ways to do this: either by negotiating phased retirement with your employer, or by leaving your full‑time job and finding new part-time work or self-employment.‘On the whole, it’s been very good,’ says Irene, an administrative assistant who has reduced her days in preparation for her retirement. ‘If I had retired suddenly, it wouldn’t have given me a chance to see what I’m going to do with my time.\u0027I hope he burns in hell!\u0027: Jessica Chambers\u0027 mom visits...Hiic Taco Bell employee is FIRED after she refused to...Share this article‘It’s taken me a while to find new clubs and classes I really like and activities I want to do. Now I’m in the swing of it, I’m really looking forward to retiring.‘Also, if I’d gone for cliff-edge retirement, the money would have been cut off straight away. As it is, I’ve gradually got used to not spending so much.’But phased retirement is not without its flaws. For some people, it turns out to be an unsatisfactory limbo where they end up with a foot in both camps, and not enough time or energy to give their full attention to either.‘It can be difficult because your position in the workplace is immediately changed,’ says Professor Phillipson. ‘You’re half in and half out.‘Some people are comfortable with the changed relationship they have with colleagues, but some aren’t. If that’s the case, they are dragging out a change they might be best doing straight away.’What’s increasingly popular is a mixture of part-time work, paid or unpaid consultancy and volunteering — which hopefully leaves time to have fun, too.With this option there’s a flexibility that allows people to shift the balance between their different activities as their priorities change. Reducing your workload in your main career is a good way of moving into a mixed portfolio.          Look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up childrenSpecific ideas are more useful than vague ambitions. Where will you spend most of your time? What will you be doing? With which friends do you want to socialise? How will weekends differ from weekdays?If you plan to volunteer, work part-time or set up your own business, find out what skills or qualifications you might need.Finally, look at roads untravelled. We have all had interests that fell by the wayside because of time pressures while we worked and brought up children. Now is the time to revive them.MANAGE THE TRANSITIONTHE latest research suggests that the best way to cope with retirement is to treat it not as the end of the road, but as a major life transition, on a par with leaving home or facing up to an empty nest.And the good news is that by this stage in their lives, people have what it takes to cope successfully, according to psychology lecturer Dr Oliver Robinson.‘We can learn a lot from previous transitions,’ he says. ‘Many of the same issues come up in major life crises, such as identity, meaning, purpose. If you navigate through a crisis successfully and grow out of it, it should mean you’re well prepared for the next one.’Ellen Langer, professor of psychology at Harvard University, agrees. ‘Retirement can be a dirty word, because people see it as the end a phase where you do nothing,’ she says. ‘If you change jobs, you go from Job A to Job B. But retirement has no B attached. The antidote is to see retirement as a change, rather than a movement towards nothing.’This new and illuminating approach focuses on how the psychological qualities we have developed during previous transitions and throughout our working lives — attributes such as resilience, adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a ‘can-do’ attitude — can stand us in good stead for the challenges of retirement.John, who took two extended breaks from work to go travelling, first in his 30s and then in his 50s, when he went to Barcelona for a few months to learn Spanish and ended up staying away for seven years, is a case in point.‘I think both experiences helped me when it came to preparing for retirement,’ he says. ‘You realise that you have to make things happen. You can’t be passive.’He is so right. It’s true that the happiest retired people are often the ones who are most proactive about looking for interesting stuff to do. If there’s no birdwatching or film club in their area, they don’t hang around they set one up.When one friend of mine retired to the countryside, she really missed her book group. So she bravely went up to anyone she liked the look of and asked if they would like to join hers.If you’re lucky enough to come across someone like this, see them as the true asset they are.IT’S TIME TO CREATE A NEW YOURETIRING involves one of the biggest shifts of identity we ever go through — as momentous as becoming a parent or leaving home. After years of being seen, and of seeing yourself, as a shopkeeper or a nurse or an engineer, you suddenly become an ex-whatever it was. It’s common to feel, as Nadia does, ‘that you’re 60 and you’re just not in the world any more. You don’t matter.’For her, the loss of status she feels is acute.‘I don’t like being invisible when I walk into a room,’ says Nadia. ‘At work you have a formal place to assert yourself. You get paid.          Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you‘Then all that structure is shipped away and you’re left just sort of flapping around, saying: “I used to be a . . .”‘Everything you’ve built up throughout your career disappears, and suddenly you’re just another old lady looking to do a bit of volunteering.’For women in particular, work bestows an independent identity quite separate from home and family life. When that disappears — and it often coincides with losing the hands-on parenting role — it can leave people feeling doubly discombobulated.It may be that you don’t even want to think about a new identity before you retire. But if you are aware that work dominates your life (or your partner’s) to the exclusion of other interests, it’s worth starting to develop at least one new activity beforehand.Supportive networks that run parallel to work and that will continue beyond it can be a huge help.People will start to see you not just as a brilliant brain surgeon, but as a wicked darts player or a fine guitarist.Playing in a band, taking an evening class, working on an allotment, being a member of a sports club or a book group can all form bridges between the old you and the new you.It’s also important to reinforce this new identity with other people. Rather than apologetically saying: ‘I used to be a . . .’ when asked what you do, it feels much more positive to say: ‘I’m studying astronomy,’ or ‘I’m planning to start a rag-rugging business.’Soon, other people in your immediate circle and beyond will get used to seeing you in a new light, and that, in turn, reinforces your own new view of yourself.Liz, who retired two years ago, got round the problem by telling people she was taking ‘a pause’, rather than that she had finished work. ‘If you tell people you’re retired, their eyes glaze over a bit — especially younger people,’ she says. ‘I didn’t enjoy the glazing.‘However, when I started exploring a new part of myself and tried out different things I really enjoyed, I became comfortable with the idea of a different identity. Now I’m happy to say I’m retired.’It’s a process that happens organically, but sometimes it needs a bit of a push.As your work persona gradually recedes, it leaves space for a different side of life to take centre stage, and you can spend more time on activities that resonate with your core values.

At the time he dismissed the claims as a ‘big lie’ and successfully sued the paper for libel.But documents, published in The Spy and the Traitor, show that MI6 thought the evidence presented by Mr Gordievsky was strong enough to pass on to the Queen.In a 1982 debriefing, the former agent allegedly said the KGB had paid Mr Foot the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money, according to the new book.Even though he was supposedly paid by the Soviets, Mr Gordievsky said that the politician was not a ‘spy or conscious agent’.Labour accused of \u0027dangerous\u0027 game playing that puts power...Share this articleInstead he was allegedly a contact who was paid for ‘disinformation purposes’, meaning he might have been fed false information.Mr Foot lost the 1983 election to Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative Party, helped in large part by Britain’s victory in the Falklands War.Author Ben Macintyre wrote: ‘Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election.

The file claims Mr Foot was first contacted by Soviet intelligence while working at the left-wing magazine Tribune in the 1940s.Mr Gordievsky also made claims about how the Soviet secret services had infiltrated other factions of the Labour Party, which had become increasingly left-wing in the early 1980s.The party’s 1983 election manifesto, which outlined several socialist policies, was later dubbed ‘the longest suicide note in history’ by Labour MP Gerald Kaufman.Mr Foot resigned following the election defeat and three years as Labour leader. He died in 2010 aged 96.Trade union leader Jack Jones was also listed as an ‘agent’ by Mr Gordievsky.

If so, this suggests that when men feel confident, they speak with faster and louder speech.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69fecc88c0d222149d6c6a7fae575401f7e8da49/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c3a25a7c8df835a170cb58553acf6a","title":"the 10 most innovative mercury prize albums of all time","story":"Every year, the Hyundai Mercury Prize celebrates the most inventive British and Irish albums released in the previous 12 months. Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c183f9463a970177eb8bae76a70b126cd20d4d/0_205_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25fff624d14fbe5db8f71747d4eddcfa","title":"victoria and albert museum dundee v and a flawed treasure house on the tay","story":"You cannot fault the ambition that underpins the V\u0026ampA’s striking new northern outpost, but behind the powerful exterior not all is sweetness and lightIn the Oak Room, a 1907 interior by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, a gallery balustrade is decorated with thin strips of timber that overlay and intersect like weaving. They effect transitions from firmer pillars below and plainer panels around them into delicate multiple uprights that reach to the ceiling. The gridded pattern of the wood is echoed in metal lampshades whose coloured glass enriches the shadows of alcoves beneath the gallery. The whole is a beautiful ensemble of light, structure and ornament, a feat of unified ersity made possible by the expressive range of the main material, oak.The room was part of the Ingram Street Tearooms in Glasgow, rescued from the demolition of its host building in 1971 and kept in storage and in pieces until now. Its reconstruction is one of the triumphs of the new Victoria and Albert Museum in Dundee, where exhibits from the V\u0026ampA’s collections are combined with loans from elsewhere. A temporary exhibition space, built to the same large dimensions as Amanda Levete Architects’ recent Sainsbury Gallery at the V\u0026ampA mothership in London, enables blockbuster shows to travel between one and the other. The museum opens with the V\u0026ampA’s splendid Ocean Liners: Speed and Style exhibition.The Oak Room stands in the Scottish Design Galleries, a sampling of the prodigious contribution made by a nation of 5 million or so people to the design of the manmade world. There is the heavy engineering that you might expect, bridges and ships, but also the abstract, ahead-of-its-time glassware of the late-Victorian designer Christopher Dresser, the anarchic glory of the Dundee-based Beano, computer games created in the same city, the luxurious classicism of the 18th-century architect Robert Adam and the freestyle brutalism of the 20th-century’s Basil Spence.The container of these treasures is an £80m building on the edge of the majestic River Tay – a conjoined pair of inverted pyramids in rugged concrete inspired, says its Tokyo-based architect Kengo Kuma, by Scottish cliffs. It’s a memorable, impressive object, already popular for fashion shoots and car promotions, which will do its job of announcing Dundee’s ambition to the world. It has powerful moments, especially when you pass towards the landscape through an arch formed between the two main blocks. Its cragginess suits its tough northern location.All of which – both the promise of the form and the quality of the exhibits – make it headbangingly frustrating that a series of somewhat inexplicable architectural decisions keeps intruding on the journey from one to the other. Good design, as the contents of the galleries show, is purposeful, or joyous, or practical, or liberating, or any combination of the above. Too much of the new building just gets in the way. It is laborious, to no clear benefit.Let’s start with the view. Dundee’s setting, on a slope towards the broad river, is wonderful urban topography, and it’s a bonus of the V\u0026ampA project that it has enabled the improvement of what was a messed-up bit of waterfront. With some difficulty and expense, Kuma’s building is partly built on the water, also in the name of connection with nature. Yet once you get inside what is a blocky presence on the quay, you at first see the river only through shards and postcards of glass.That could be OK. The response to spectacular scenery need not always be panoramic transparent walls. As there can be beauty in framing, in selecting and unfolding, you await, as you progress through the building, the big reveal. The trouble is that it never comes, not even on a first-floor cafe terrace, being always compromised and blinkered by bits of architecture, odd triangles and screens, of unclear purpose. You can never sit back, look at the horizon and let out a contented sigh. Nor can you discern a guiding intelligence to the cutting and rationing of the view.Then there’s a nice-sounding idea, a generously scaled entrance hall, which, says Kuma, can also be a public space for the people of Dundee, a place to linger whether or not they have come to see any exhibits, sheltered from the not always pleasant weather. So there’s a double-height volume, a broad stair and lift tower within it, which opens up to a broad first-floor deck on which relatively impromptu exhibitions can be held.It looks the part, but its oddly distributed space is not actually congenial to the uses advertised. What with a reception desk, the displays of a shop and few tables and chairs, there’s not much room left on the ground floor for Dundonian flâneurs to enjoy the urban experience. The upper level is, conversely, prairie-like, sparsely populated by a few hard benches. The stair between the two floors is broad but straight and not especially conducive to lingering.The museum’s inverted pyramid shape gives sloping planes that, if terraced into artificial hills on which visitors could sit and pass the time, might nicely fulfil Kuma’s stated aims. They are, instead, inaccessible because they are, I’m told, too steep. They are steep because that’s what the geometry of the external form requires, which raises the question: what’s more important – the lived experience of the spaces or abstract geometry?What’s going on here is a common trait of architecture, the mistaking of a sign of an action for its reality. A big volume looks as if it will be a happy gathering place for a lot of people but turns out to be more a space for the architect’s mind to inhabit. Kuma says his building is “organic”, by which he means that its rough-hewn shape looks like a work of nature, but a larger meaning of the word is that a design grows harmoniously out of its situation and use. This it does not.The same goes for the materials and details. The initial ideas are good – concrete striations in response to the exposed location give way to timber striations inside, to make a warmer, gentler atmosphere, after which the plaster of galleries necessarily takes over. In terms of quality of construction, the builders have done a good job. But there’s a lack of thought about how these good ideas go together that, combined with the angular geometry, leads to agonising shipwrecks at the encounters of concrete, wood, plaster, steel andor glass. There is none of the Oak Room’s ability to connect and unify the like and the unalike.Don’t look too closely at those concrete strips on the exterior either, or you will see clunky brackets holding them in place. It’s best not to worry too much about the fact that the building’s construction is solid concrete, to which a cosmetic outer layer of yet more concrete has been heavily applied. There must, surely, have been a less ponderous way of achieving the desired effect.This project should be about relationships. There’s the landscape, the city, the contents, the people and, standing alongside, a beautiful ship, the Discovery, which Scott and Shackleton used on their Antarctic expeditions. The new building, while having a presence of its own, should enable and enhance these relationships. Too often, in striving too hard to announce its artistic attentions, it merely adds noise.None of which should detract from the achievements of the city and University of Dundee, both of which were instrumental in bringing the V\u0026ampA to the banks of the Tay. The contents justify themselves. They’ve also got themselves a landmark that, despite its perversities, will wear in. But between your first impression of the rocky building and close encounters with the exhibits, I suggest you distract yourself, perhaps by playing a Dundonian game on your phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8a02bac731dae72c77b623c3418b974defd9cf/0_356_5340_3204/master/5340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b14e486cf2ed8f53e0071ae38b84646","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Daily life in Pyongyang, Hurricane Florence, protests in Gaza and Serena Williams at the US Open in New York – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf727e5295539d51342c660304b1d9b7ae5805ac/0_748_1844_1106/master/1844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed3eb767f78c93cd6e228bff1f67874","title":"matilda at 30 roald dahl quentin blake","story":"To mark three decades since Roald Dahl’s heroine first appeared, her illustrator, Quentin Blake, has imagined her life nowShe was the quintessential young rebel who broke all the rules about how good little girls should be portrayed in children’s literature by standing up to bullies in the name of justice – and having a laugh at the same time.Now, Roald Dahl’s Matilda – the most powerful female genius ever to be underestimated by a hammer-throwing headmistress – has been portrayed for the first time as a 30-year-old woman in a series of eight sketches by Dahl’s long-time illustrator and friend Quentin Blake.To mark the 30th anniversary of the first publication of the book, three of these sketches will appear next month on the covers of special collectors’ editions, showing Matilda variously as an astrophysicist, a world traveller and as chief executive of the British Library. “Oh good,” Dr Matilda Wormwood is pictured thinking as a male library assistant brings her a huge pile of books: “Here’s one I haven’t read.”In his foreword to the new editions, Blake, 85, reveals he enjoyed imagining what Matilda might be doing now she has grown up. “Since, as a small child, Matilda was gifted in several ways, it wasn’t very difficult. I imagined that for each version of our grown-up Matilda one of her extraordinary talents and achievements would have come to the fore and shown her a role in life,” he writes.“I am sure that someone who had read so many books when she was small could easily have become chief executive of the British Library, or someone exceptionally gifted at mental arithmetic would be perfectly at home in astrophysics. And if you have been to so many countries in books, what could be more natural than to go and see them yourself?”Blake describes illustrating Matilda as a wonderful experience. “It has been very special to revisit her all these years later and marvel at the woman she would have become.”Matilda has been one of Dahl’s bestselling books since it was published in 1988, with 17 million copies sold worldwide, but sales have particularly spiked in the past two years and it is now outselling all of Dahl’s other titles.Carmen McCullough, Roald Dahl editor at Matilda’s publisher, Puffin, believes this reflects a wider trend in children’s fiction: “We’ve seen a real movement towards more feminist publishing recently. Parents are more keen than ever to present aspirational female characters to their young children – boys and girls – and that is what’s helping Matilda stand out, because she’s a wonderful example. She has such belief in herself and is every bit as relevant and inspirational to children and adults today as she was 30 years ago.”Children’s laureate Lauren Child agrees part of Matilda’s enduring universal appeal is that Dahl chose to write about a spirited little girl. “Like Jo in Little Women and Pippi Longstocking, Matilda is an incredibly modern character. You can relate to her. She’s not a sap, she’s not a goody two-shoes, she doesn’t take everything sitting down, she fights back. She’s for justice.”Children’s fiction continues to be dominated by male characters because publishers wrongly think boys don’t like to read books about heroines, she says – and this continues to make Matilda appear fresh and relevant. “We are surprised by Matilda because there aren’t many modern female characters like her. We shouldn’t be, but we still are because times haven’t quite changed enough.”The success of Matilda the Musical, which has been seen by 8 million people in 65 cities around the world, has helped to reignite interest in the story among adults.The book’s publishers hope millennials who enjoyed reading Matilda as children will purchase (or be given) the 30th anniversary edition in order to read the story again as adults, choosing the cover which most suits their own view of what Matilda would be like at 30.Child, the author and illustrator of the Charlie and Lola picture books, believes Matilda would have become an inventor. “I think she would be a very creative person at 30. The way she thinks is interesting. She thinks in a sideways way, a way that’s out of a box. She’s not confined. But the thing that you feel most about her is that she could be anything. I think that’s the message of the book: You can’t beat someone down if they’re interested in the world and they have a good heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/996e845349245d0e1cf86e82ac5db174dc58ebf3/0_209_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e01338cbf08dd935775685e23996f2fc","title":"patrick dewitt interview french exit","story":"Patrick deWitt, 43, is a Canadian novelist and screenwriter, now living in Portland, Oregon. His first book, Ablutions, was a New York Times editors’ choice while his second, The Sisters Brothers, was shortlisted for the 2011 Man Booker prize. His new novel, French Exit, is a satire of the super-rich.One of the characters is a medium who can sense when death is imminent. Do you believe in the occult?I do, absolutely. I’ve had experiences of seeing and feeling ghosts in my life. And I think there are all sorts of things that go on behind the scenes that we can’t necessarily define or put words to. To me, these are frightening elements and I don’t necessarily like to address them in my daily life, but my desire to write about them in fiction is apparently overwhelming. I keep doing it over and over again.But here you’re writing about the occult in a satirical setting. Does that help manage the fear?I think so. Bad news is always best delivered with a laugh.There seems to be a surge in satirical novels at the moment. Why do you think that is?I think that in unhappy times, the healthiest thing is to turn to humour. There’s so much bad news accruing in the world – you’ll give yourself cancer if you don’t have a laugh from time to time.Did you grow up in a bookish household?Yes, my father was always a big reader and he still is. I started reading his books when I was around 12 or 13.Did you discuss books with your\u0026nbspfather?Yes, but to his credit he never came at it from above. He always addressed me eye-to-eye and he had the decency to treat me like a peer. That was important to me. You want to be met as an equal and so even at that young age it was something I recognised and appreciated.What were your favourite books as a\u0026nbspchild?I loved the Choose Your Own Adventure novels, and I loved the Asterix and Tintin comics. And once I started reading proper novels, my father had a lot of beat books – you know, boozy, druggy, sex-filled\u0026nbspbooks.I’ve read that you didn’t flourish at school. What was it about school that you didn’t like?If there’s a subject I’m meant to study and master I almost can’t do it unless I want to. If I don’t have a personal interest, I simply can’t absorb information. So I was a poor student because almost all of the subjects that I was meant to study were just horrifically dull to\u0026nbspme.You did many jobs before becoming a writer – in kitchens, building sites, bars. Did those experiences influence the kind of writer you’ve become?I think they must have done. Working all those years in jobs that I didn’t necessarily enjoy, and some of which I hated, I’m very grateful to be able to write full time. There’s a lingering fear of having to return to a job that I don’t enjoy.Which literary figures – dead or alive – would you most like to meet?I think I would like to have a drink with Jane Bowles or Gertrude Stein. Or both together.Is there a famous book you’ve never got around to reading?I’ve just been realising there are all these enormous gaps in my syllabus, because when you’re self-educated you don’t have someone holding your hand. So most of the classics I haven’t read, I’m sad to say. I haven’t read Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past, which just seems pathetic.Who would you like to write the story of your life?If Gertrude Stein wouldn’t mind writing in the voice of Alice B Toklas, that would be alright for me.What’s the best book you’ve ever been given as a present?I’m a terrible person to buy books for because an enormous part of the process of finding authors I enjoy is that I found them. And this is probably just unbridled narcissism. But typically what happens when I’m given a book is that I say thank you very much and I put it in the stacks and it disappears. I never read it. Basically it’s a bit of a fool’s errand to buy me books. Save your money.But do you like buying books for other\u0026nbsppeople?I do. I buy books for other people all the time. At Christmas that’s all I give – everyone gets books even if they don’t want them. I love to give Jane Bowles’s novel Two Serious Ladies.What was the last great book you\u0026nbspread?I discovered Barbara Pym late in life and I just adored Excellent Women.What books do you have on your bedside table to read next?A book by Fran Ross called Oreo, which I’m told is very funny. And I have a Nancy Mitford book called Wigs on the Green, which I don’t know anything about but I’m curious to try out.Why the particular interest in Pym and\u0026nbspMitford?I think I’ve been writing in this style for a while – inane comedic dialogue which I just have an affinity for. Growing up in a household where Monty Python was on all the time probably influenced this in some way. And there’s a distinctly British sensibility to my mother’s side of the family – her mother was a Brit – and it was just something I was exposed to at a young age. As I’ve come into my own as a writer, I see that my fascination with that style of writing is not going away, it just seems to be getting stronger. So I feel duty bound to do my homework and figure out who are the best.Patrick deWitt will be speaking at Waterstones Manchester Deansgate on 26 September and Waterstones London Piccadilly on 27 September.

I’m sure I speak for most of the country when I say it feels like we’ve been talking about Brexit for far longer.It’s no secret I campaigned for the UK to remain and I’ve said all along that any form of Brexit – no matter how hard or soft – would result in fewer jobs, less prosperity and a reduced role for Britain on the world stage. The evidence for this is irrefutable.However, the will of the British people was to leave the EU. I respect that and wanted us to make the best of the situation. That’s why, since the referendum, I’ve given the government my support where appropriate as they’ve tried to negotiate with the EU. It’s why, despite our many differences, I’ve worked closely with the Brexit secretary and other cabinet members to push for the best possible deal.In good faith, I’ve given the government every bit of advice and information available to City Hall and every opportunity to strike a deal that would minimise the impact on people’s livelihoods. But I’ve become increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations has become mired in confusion and deadlock, leading us down a path that could be hugely damaging – not only to London, but the whole country.The unfortunate reality is that Theresa May has failed to negotiate a Brexit position with her own party – let alone agree a deal with the EU. At every stage, her government has looked unprepared and out of its depth, resulting in a litany of wrong turns. And, not for the first time, it seems the debate has become more about Boris Johnson’s political ambitions than what’s good for the country.Until now, I’ve held out hope the government would finally get its act together, start listening to the advice of employers, trade unions and everyone who has a stake in getting this right and seek the best possible deal with the EU – putting the national interest ahead of narrow party politics. But it’s clear this prospect is now dead in the water.With time rapidly running out, we are left with two possibilities – a bad deal, which could end up being so vague that we leave the EU blind to what our future relationship will be, or a “no-deal” Brexit.Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public. They are also both incredibly risky and I don’t believe May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the economy and people’s livelihoods.Terrifyingly, we are now in real danger of crashing out of the EU with no deal. Despite the fanciful assurances from Johnson, this would be by far the worst outcome – with independent research showing that it could potentially result in 500,000 fewer jobs across Britain by 2030. These are real jobs and people’s living standards being put at risk.So, after a lot of careful consideration, I’ve decided the people must get a final say. This means a public vote on any deal or a vote on a no-deal, alongside the option of staying in the EU.As mayor, I wouldn’t be doing my job standing up for Londoners if I didn’t say now that it’s time to think again about how we take this crucial decision.I don’t believe it’s the will of the people to face either a bad deal or, worse, no deal. That wasn’t on the table during the campaign. People didn’t vote to leave the EU to make themselves poorer, to watch their businesses suffer, to have NHS wards understaffed, to see the police preparing for civil unrest or for national security to be put at risk if our co-operation with the EU in the fight against terrorism is weakened.It’s time to take this crucial issue out of the hands of the politicians and return it to the peopleso that they can take back control. Another public vote on Brexit was never inevitable, or something I ever thought I’d have to call for. But the government’s abject failure – and the huge risk we face of a bad deal or a “no deal” Brexit – means that giving people a fresh say is now the right – and only – approach left for our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10003f1a332e075a6ed806aeb56b3d4a460b1635/0_18_4712_2827/master/4712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=569cd9a5a7517e53c83a6f382252cf12","title":"regrets viola davis has had a few","story":"Plenty of people have regrets over past professional decisions.

Its lyrics (“once a whore, nothing more”) have a tinge of catty spite that betrays her youth when she wrote it and she’s spoken before about being uncomfortable with its message now. Before giving it one last airing at a hometown show in Nashville, she dedicated it to “every bad decision that led us here… to all the embarrassing things we might have said, but we owned up to it and we grew”.The inestimable Viola Davis recently offered a thoughtful examination of her Oscar-nominated turn as Aibileen in The Help in the New York Times. When asked about any regrets she had over roles that she had passed on, Davis turned the question. “Almost a better question is, ‘Have I ever done roles that I’ve regretted?’” she replied, going on to talk about her lack of ease with how The Help turned out. “I just felt that at the end of the day it wasn’t the voices of the maids that were heard,” she said.The director Ava DuVernay tweeted her support, adding that she had worked as a publicist on the film, her last PR job, and that it gave her the push she needed to make her own movies.These stories are vastly different, of course, but in their own ways they speak to an acknowledgment that choices can be, simply, complicated and changeable. In the act of documenting everything, social media has the curious effect of making opinions seem permanent and fixed, as if people don’t obviously, inevitably, change as time – and times – move on. These kinds of discussion feel like a tiny crack in the rigidity of such thinking.There’s a whole genre of literature dedicated to enabling people who love lists, who shiver with contentment at the mere thought of ticking things off.There are books dedicated to filling in themed lists, film or music or travel ones, where you can note down, for example, the best beaches you’ve been to or favourite movie duos. (There’s also Man List – subtitle: Every Man Needs a Good List – which sings with endless possibilities.) But here’s an idea for the next instalment, which should be called Typical Days (That Are Not So Typical) and should be dedicated to competing with Mark Wahlberg. For a list connoisseur, Wahlberg’s “typical day”, which went viral last week, is a thing of beauty and terror.Wahlberg goes to bed early, because he wakes up at 2.30am. By the time he gets around to 11am “family time”, he has gone through a detailed roadmap of his every moment and has prayed, worked out, played golf, eaten several meals and snacks and enjoyed a period of “cryo chamber recovery”.What I like about this list, other than the sheer impractical detail and devotion of it, is that it’s stark proof of how aspirational celebrity life is a total fantasy. I feel the same whenever an actress admits that they’re always hungry in lieu of Hollywood not deferring to one kind of body, at least there’s an honesty in talking about the contortions it takes to fit into that system.I don’t wish to compare myself to Wahlberg (not again!) but I have barely woken up my brain enough to decide whether to have cereal or toast by 11am. I guess that’s why he’s a renowned movie star and I’m still waiting for that call to lead the next Transformers movie.For many, the Who’s Roger Daltrey is a timeless rock’n’roll icon, a symbol of 60s rebellion and decadence, forever the snarling, sneering voice of My Generation.To add to that, I also always think of him as a fish farmer, thanks to a long-running joke in Absolutely Fabulous. Daltrey told the Sun that he’s not so keen on the voices of female pop stars these days, owing to the fact that they use in-ear monitors, which, he suggests, makes them sing more quietly.“It goes up into the head and starts coming through the nose and they sound like Mickey Mouse. I find it soulless because it’s not come from the heart.”Daltrey makes an exception for Adele, as he did when he bemoaned the lack of “lead singers” in music in 2011, and for Ed Sheeran, whose “voice is so pure and powerful. He sings from the heart.”I love Adele and have a soft spot for Sheeran, but it’s worth noting, apropos of nothing, that earlier this year at a show in Las Vegas, Daltrey also described himself as “very, very deaf” and urged people to wear earplugs, so as not to suffer the same fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6a625c7ad3c1b2cec95a0e29fa37b3e3b5aa08/0_318_4731_2837/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0480322e28b879213a25152d98d3f65b","title":"thanks to the victoria and albert dundee no longer butt of a nations jokes","story":"Even in our ritual besmirching and humiliation of Dundee, we treated the city unequally. Other towns and cities blighted by social disadvantage found a sympathetic response and sometimes outrage when annually it was revealed how badly we permitted people to live in this affluent country. The health inequalities that have long existed in\u0026nbspparts of Glasgow have kept the UK’s film and documentary sector afloat these last 20 years or so and rescued us journalists and commentators with a steady supply of numbers and testimonies.Glasgow is a big, brassy city and its advocates are never slow and rarely quiet about proclaiming its virtues and bewailing its problems. Not Dundee. Instead, we turned this city into a national joke. When, some years ago, statistics were released detailing the extent of underage maternity rates in Dundee they provided gags for a generation of professional comedians and amateur clowns who had never visited this city.The statistics that described multi-deprivation in some parts of Dundee were added merely as an afterthought in grim stories about Glasgow. Yet while my city was reckoned to have initiatives, gly projects and international sporting events all wrapped up in “wur culture” to dislodge the negative headlines, we thought of Dundee as beyond redemption. But it was never like this, not even close.Perhaps we can trace the fight-back to rescue Dundee’s reputation to 1986 when the Discovery, the ship\u0026nbspthat carried Scott and Shackleton on their first, successful Antarctic expedition, returned to the city that built her. Yet still the jokes and the ignorance continued and proud Dundonians who were making a difference in other places, among new friends, bore the brunt of their wit with fortitude and good humour. This was the city that founded a newspaper empire of global renown and a comic-book industry that inspired generations of artists and illustrators. It was the city of the Tay bridges, for heaven’s sake, and a shipbuilding and maritime powerhouse. It was the home of a world-class textile industry that became so successful that jute, an Indian fabric, was associated only with it.Dundee gave us the Average White Band, the Associates, Michael Marra and the author AL Kennedy. It’s currently the centre of the games industry, the coolest and edgiest sector in the world. It continues to provide big men and women for newspapers and television, all of whom I bow to. It never really had anything to be ashamed of and much for which the rest of Scotland ought to have been proud long before the V\u0026ampA Museum of Design opened this weekend. I can’t even begin to figure out why we bullied this city and its citizens for having social problems that were evident to the same degree in many other cities across the UK.And I’m not saying either that the V\u0026ampA will somehow wave a wand over Dundee and make things better just yet, but dear God in heaven it will surely make a difference. When I visited Dundee last month to see the V\u0026ampA, I met several Dundonians from an assortment of backgrounds. None talked about money being better spent on hospitals and schools. Instead, there was a recognition that relatively little of the £80m raised to build it had come from the civic purse. There was pride in this building, too, laced with a measure of relief that it was something beautiful. One local artist told me that as the design of the V\u0026ampA first began to emerge a series of pictures in the Dundee Courier it took the city’s breath away.A sense of social outreach, of making this a living, breathing part of Dundee, is embedded in its curved, concrete walls. Its Japanese creator, Kengo Kuma, has talked of it becoming the city’s living room, but it is already more than that. Mike Galloway, Dundee’s director of city development, has helped drive the V\u0026ampA project since its inception. He told me that the companies and contractors chosen to develop the waterfront around the V\u0026ampA had to sign a pledge to employ local people and to pay them Scotland’s enhanced living wage.Even when he encountered resistance to this wage guarantee, he was able to prove that this carried long-term economic benefits and stability as well as increased productivity.When he talked about the inspiration of Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum, he cited what many forget: that this Basque city in northern Spain was also regarded as the country’s school dunce. The projected estimates for the Guggenheim were about 500,000 visitors a year very quickly, that became 1.5 million, many of them people who simply can’t stop returning every year. “An assessment of its economic impact found that the Guggenheim was a prominent factor in persuading companies to invest in the city often, it just tipped the scales in favour of Bilbao.”Within the walls of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, families will be encouraged to spend hours here and not feel pressure to spend money for the pleasure. They can bring their own food and fire up their electronic devices and simply linger here out of the rain or away from the troubles of life. The art and artefacts may inspire and soothe them but the building itself will probably already have done that.In the city beyond, there will still be unemployment and health inequality and low wages some schools will continue to encounter poverty of ambition and an absence of self-esteem. A celebration of design also salutes the power of imagination and creativity to solve problems and the willingness to embrace risk. This may yet prove to be the V\u0026ampA’s greatest gift to Dundee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2739b3ba946e70360b408f2f6b2835e7e7964e35/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31088891afbd5e636f578a7d926a3bff","title":"welfare was meant to help the poor not subsidise exploitative employers","story":"It will mean fewer jobs. That was the chorus from many on the right, from Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in response to proposals from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to improve conditions for gig economy workers. Such workers, he insisted, should be given similar rights to those in permanent work, including eligibility for sick pay, maternity pay and similar benefits. He promised to ban zero-hours contracts and introduce a “real living wage” of £10 an hour.So what does it mean for Parikh and Hammond to insist that if gig workers are given decent benefits, jobs will be lost? Unpacked, what that suggests is that employers are willing, or able, to provide jobs only if workers accept low pay and poor conditions.Put like that, few people would\u0026nbspaccept the moral logic of the argument. But it is rarely put like that. We take for granted that businesses create jobs and so have the right to dictate on what conditions jobs are created.Poverty is often seen as a problem of worklessness. Today, though, it is a problem of being in work. The American sociologist Matthew Desmond recently wrote of the job market in the US: “The question is not: can I land a job? (The answer is almost certainly: yes, you can.) Instead, the question is: what kinds of jobs are available to people without much education? By and large, the answer is: jobs that do not pay enough to live on.” Much the same is true of Britain.There has been a growing casualisation of work in recent years. According to some figures, almost a third of British workers comprise a “precariat” – workers lacking job security and benefits, often shifting from one short-term position to another. “Flexibility”, a word much touted by critics of McDonnell’s proposals, may be valuable for those who don’t want the restrictions of full-time work, or who need to juggle commitments, but it has also become a euphemism for jobs with little certainty and for workers forced to inhabit the margins of the labour market.From the mid-1990s, governments have tried to offset rising in-work poverty through the benefit system. Tax credits have risen, from £7bn a year in the mid-1990s to a peak of £32bn in 2011. Since then, they have been cut as part of the austerity programme. The impact of these cuts, together with the rolling out of universal credit, could be devastating for the working poor.Tax credits may be essential for allowing many in work to keep their heads above water. They also expose the reality of the benefits system. Welfare is largely discussed from the perspective of the recipient. For most on the left, it’s a necessity for those who require social support. For many on the right, it is a reward for fecklessness and a means of establishing a “dependency culture”.In reality, the welfare system is an acknowledgement and an indictment of the inadequacies of the market system. Nothing reveals this more forcefully than the existence of the working poor and the creation of a welfare system to support them. The state is, in effect, subsidising employers so as to allow them to get away with paying indecent wages and unacceptable benefits. When business leaders and\u0026nbspTory politicians insist that better pay or conditions mean fewer jobs, what they are demanding is the right to provide jobs that are insufficient to live on and for the state to pick up the tab. There’s the real culture of dependency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24755184fe1077c4446c4b4f9ea2130","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

It follows evidence that students as old as 14 are being given English texts designed for primary children.In a wide-ranging interview with the Observer, Spielman said she had been driven “absolutely nuts” by evidence that some schools were assuming that disadvantaged children were “automatically low-achieving and need a watered-down curriculum”.“Children can go all the way through secondary school and then go bump when they hit real demands in post-16 education or have aspirations for university, because they just don’t have the experience or practice of reading more demanding texts. Schools can think they are being helpful by adapting and providing relevant material. But in fact it hollows out education and means that disadvantaged children don’t get the experience that they absolutely should. The job of schools is to make sure that children get the things they won’t necessarily get at home.”Spielman, who took over as chief inspector last year, warned that schooling standards would be put at risk by further cuts to Ofsted’s budget. She said the inspectorate was now at the “very limit of giving the level of assurance that we are expected to give”. It comes after Ofsted was criticised for failing to inspect some schools for up to a decade and only spending a day inspecting others.The chief inspector also warned that the schools system had “stopped acting in children’s interests” by allowing thousands of underperforming pupils to be ushered out of the door to protect their school’s exam pass rates.She said some schools were putting themselves first and students second by shuffling out underperforming pupils in a process known as “offrolling”. Ofsted found that between 2016 and 2017 more than 19,000 pupils did not progress from year 10 to year 11 in the same state-funded secondary school. Many were disappearing from schooling altogether.“It’s an example of where, to some extent, it looks as if the schools system has stopped acting in children’s interests, that schools’ interests are getting put ahead of children,” she said. “We need inspectors to know where a school is losing children at a rate that looks suspiciously high and have a tough conversation with the school where it is happening. There are about 300 where we can see that the number of children leaving between years 10 and 11 looks too high to be statistical noise.”Spielman said the practice was creating a system in which challenging pupils ended up in underperforming schools. “When you have children falling out of one school, what is the school that they will get put in if parents or local authorities are looking for another? It will be the undersubscribed school, which will typically be the school that is doing badly, often in a tough area.”She suggested the practice was adding to her concerns about children supposedly being educated at home.“We found that half of the children who come off a mainstream school roll at the end of year 10 don’t appear on the roll of any registered provision for year 11. That is a very big number disappearing. Home education generally is something I’m really concerned about. Those children disappear into the ether.“Nobody really knows what they are doing, who is taking responsibility for them. At one level parents are supposedly taking responsibility, but is that what is happening? There is a militantly independent group of homeschoolers who have existed for a very long time, who are politically quite powerful. There is a growing religious strand of people who want to protect their children’s faith and make sure that everything about the child’s education experience happens within the faith.“Sometimes that is in registered schools, but probably though it is hard to be sure - some children who are supposedly being home-educated are in fact in unregistered religious schools.”Spielman, who has faced hostility for accusing faith schools run by religious conservatives of deliberately resisting British values, said she believed some groups were deliberately finding loopholes in the rules to ensure their child’s education was not inspected.“Home education takes us into the territory of stuff that is hard to discuss that a lot of people find ‘undiscussable’,” she said. “We are trying to explore what is happening and why it brings you up against people who really do not want their children’s education scrutinised. I’m trying to make sure that we talk about the tough stuff and that we help make the tough stuff discussable, so that people don’t run away from it. It is difficult and it has to be talked about.”Spielman said there must be no return to the time when concerns about “cultural sensitivity” led some local authorities to be reluctant to intervene in cases of child sexual exploitation. Ofsted also inspects children’s services offered by local authorities.“One of the biggest failures of children’s services in recent years hasn’t been about resources, it has been about issues such as child sexual exploitation being undiscussable, because of different kinds of cultural sensitivity,” she said. “At Ofsted, it is easy to see how people slip back into being anxious not to offend communities or tread on toes. We must make sure we keep up the pressure to talk honestly about the tough stuff.”She responded to criticism of the regularity and thoroughness of Ofsted’s school inspections by warning that the inspectorate was doing everything it could to keep up school standards. “We are at the very limit of giving the level of assurance that we are expected to give on the current budget,” she said. Asked if further cuts would damage standards, she said: “I would hope that is how it is seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ed84338f8c5cde3ebbeb1697c1006ff963e021/192_503_7876_4726/master/7876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce9fa4036a2a6df76c1b5109a66e6e7","title":"literary figures object to mobile phone mast wales","story":"Its monks left more than a century ago but the whitewashed stone walls of the monastery in Capel-y-ffin stand proud. Outside, a large, well-preserved statue of the Virgin Mary welcomes visitors to the venerable Victorian building, which has now been converted into self-catering apartments in great demand when the crowds flock to nearby Hay-on-Wye for its celebrated literary festival.Since the monks’ departure, little has changed in this picturesque Welsh hamlet of a few houses, a chapel and a scattering of farms. Nestling in the foothills of the Black Mountains, it is a place of moss and bracken, stone walls and brooks, and has the lingering solemnity of an untended churchyard.Part of the Brecon Beacons national park, Capel-y-ffin has long repelled development. Its one obvious nod to modernity is the local phone box. When installed half a century ago or so, it was painted a muted green, in keeping with park guidelines it is now a vivid red.But this sepulchral place, without a mobile phone connection and fast internet access, looks set to be dragged into the 21st century, to the dismay of many local people and a host of literary figures who have sought refuge in Capel-y-ffin.The Home Office and telecoms network EE want to build a 17.5-metre mobile phone mast with three antennas, two microwave dishes and a pole-mounted satellite dish just above the hamlet, next to a track that provides a gateway to the Black Mountains, with their extraordinary views across Wales and England.According to the planning application, the mast will have a “medium” impact on its environment, but the Brecon Beacons Park Society disagrees. In its letter to Lisa Williams, the authority’s planning officer, the society says: “Many people would find the contrast of the lines of the brutalist tower, with its attachments, cabinet, concrete base and mesh fenced compound, an extremely stark contrast with the natural flow of the landscape.”The novelist Ian McEwan is among the 60 people who have objected to the proposal, which goes before the Brecon Beacons national park planning authority next month. “I have hiked in this region for almost half a century,” he wrote. “Its unchanged nature is just one of its many attractions.”“There’s something special about this place,” says Erica Mary Griffiths, who was born in the monastery in the 1930s and runs a pony trekking centre in the area. “People who are a bit lost, not quite sure where to go, they tend to find their way up this valley, to this place of tranquillity.”Griffiths remembers how the telephone wires had to go underground rather than on poles when the hamlet got landlines, such were the stringent protections laid down by the park authority. She remembers, too, how the monastery took in refugees during the second world war. After the horrors of what they had fled, its solitude must have seemed a balm.It wasn’t just refugees who found solace in its isolation. Painters, poets and sculptors were inspired by time spent in the valley. And a veritable Who’s Who of 20th-century fiction has been touched by the place after spending time at Carney, a small stone cottage in danger of being overrun by rosehips and brambles, owned by the publisher Tom Maschler.Doris Lessing, Kurt Vonnegut, John Fowles, McEwan, Arnold Wesker and Edna O’Brien all stayed at the cottage, which is only 150 metres from the site of the proposed mast. It was in Carney that Bruce Chatwin wrote his novel On the Black Hill.The beat poet Allen Ginsberg was inspired to write Wales Visitation after staying at Carney. Photographs of Ginsberg, taken by Maschler, show him rolling around on the hills “smelling the brown vagina-moist ground”, as he enthused in his poem, lauding their remoteness from the connected world: “160 miles from London’s symmetrical thorned tower  \u0026amp network of TV pictures”.Alice Maschler, Tom’s daughter, has been instrumental in mobilising opposition. “When I heard about this proposal, I cried, and felt like I had lost someone I relied on, no matter what,” she said. “Carney and its surrounds is a sanctuary, where people come and touch a magical presence.”While many believe the mast will be an ugly intrusion, others fear the impact of its technology. In her letter of objection, Griffiths writes: “There are so many unanswered questions about these new mobile wireless phones, iPads and computers being introduced everywhere today.”Her views accord with those of a growing army of people who, like the refugees who once came to Capel-y-ffin, are fleeing something they fear. In online forums, “electromagnetic refugees” discuss the best places in the world to live away from microwave radiation, which they believe is making people ill. The movement is particularly vocal in Australia and pockets of the US.Others, however, see the mast– which initially will deliver a new emergency services network – very differently. One farmer who declined to give his name said: “I had a heart attack two years ago and luckily was near the landline. But if I’d been a couple of miles away, I’d have needed a mobile phone then. The people complaining only come here twice a year.”Amid the standoff, some locals seek a compromise – moving the mast to a less prominent position or substituting it for a different type that would be lower and less obtrusive. The planning authority’s own guidelines state: “Where developments would be visually prominent, evidence must be provided to show that alternative locations have been investigated and are impractical.” Some locals question whether such alternatives have been discussed.As they made their way up the valley last Thursday, walkers Rod and Angie Edwards stopped to drink in the view. Rod used to design windfarms for a living. “I’d go ballistic if someone wanted to put a windfarm here but a 17.5-metre mast isn’t so high,” he said. “We live on the edge of Snowdonia and our children couldn’t get a mobile signal when they were teenagers. We’ve got superfast broadband now and it makes all the difference.”But Griffiths, born and bred in the valley, believes the mast is too high a price to pay. “People find a lot of peace and quiet here,” she said. “There are not things going on like there are in other places.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80636e283df2750ca3298bde44688e77447e7e0c/0_30_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9600e713479143a9469139df806bb6be","title":"alexa chung london tomboy parisian chic designer debut london fashion week","story":"“Going to catwalk shows and being photographed wearing nice clothes doesn’t make you an expert on them,” said Alexa Chung on Saturday before her debut show as a fashion designer.True, but the glamorous version of on-the-job training – which saw Chung become a well-known face at London fashion week long before she launched her Alexachung label – has paid off: her clothes comfortably held their own on the catwalk. Chung hopes this collection, entitled Arrivals and Departures, will show the industry her label is here to stay.The biggest challenge of her first season as a designer was “the moving parts of putting on a fashion show”, said Chung backstage afterwards. “We built a maze for the models to walk through,” she explained of the curving screens which snaked around her subterranean venue. “It looked great but made things quite complicated. We had to paint arrows on the floor so the models didn’t get lost.”The Alexachung look is very recognisably the Alexa Chung look. The mood is London tomboy, the cut Parisian chic. Most of the signatures that have seen Chung twice given the British Style trophy at the British Fashion Awards – essentially an official “best-dressed” – made cameo appearances here. A pair of off-white dungarees, a high-waisted jumpsuit, a bibbed party dress, cropped stiff-denim jeans, a patent trench coat: all these pieces are straight out of Chung’s own playbook and all looked contemporary and wearable.“Rock stars in the 70s. That’s always my favourite look,” was Chung’s answer to the question of what was on this season’s moodboard. George Harrison in a departure lounge and Bianca Jagger on the steps of a private jet were touchstones. (There was even a safari suit.)The experience of being photographed and scrutinised “gives you an insight into thinking about clothes as image making, which is different from thinking about clothes as what you might want to wear to the pub,” the model-turned-muse-turned-designer had said before the show. “It makes you think about clothes in terms of problem-solving and storytelling.”A show that was set in an imaginary airport gave Chung the opportunity to flesh out some characters. So there was “a girl flying home from Ibiza who’s been up all night”, for instance. (That was possibly the one in the sultry black satin party dress teamed with clear plastic beach shoes.) The references were jetset but the details very British: a conversation print dress featured postcard images of Brighton and Margate. “Humour is always part of what I do. That’s a very British thing in fashion, I think,” said Chung.Steve Coogan was a guest, along with Chung’s friends Daisy Lowe and Pixie Geldof, but the front row was relatively low key, suggesting Chung wanted to play down the celebrity angle of her brand. “I did this because I want people to recognise that we are a real company and we are not going anywhere,” she said. “And also because when anything slightly scares me or feels intimidating, I can’t help but want to open that door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7abf75b3be16dbd100d5176843fbcf34ea193e2/425_44_2523_1514/master/2523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9d4fa5619dd09cfcc2bd5738c62846c","title":"burberry looks to fresh start with riccardo tisci debut","story":"After revelations about the way it disposed of unsold products, the luxury brand’s new creative lead will unveil his first collection at London fashion weekBurberry will be looking to put to bed recent troubles as new chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci unveils his first collection for the house at London fashion week.Following the revelation in August that it destroyed £28.6m worth of unsold product last year, the company attracted widespread criticism. It quickly denounced the practice, with CEO Marco Gobbetti confirming it would no longer take place, saying that it was “just not modern”. At the same time, he announced that the use of animal fur would be banned with immediate effect, creating a clean slate ahead Tisci’s debut on Monday.“This marks a new era for the brand, and one that is focused on communicating and putting new values into action,” says Kathryn Bishop, deputy foresight editor at the Future Laboratory. “It is having to show its existing and target customers that it is driven to both do and be better.”The 44-year-old Italian designer, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Bailey’s 17-year tenure, has form for breathing new life into a heritage house. Prior to his appointment at Burberry, he worked at Givenchy – the house famous for its elegant gowns worn by the likes of Audrey Hepburn – for 12 years. During his tenure, the brand increased more than six-fold in size, he tripled the number of employees from 290 to 930 and departed as brand revenues topped $540m. Its popularity soared, too, thanks to his influential celebrity following – he designed Kim Kardashian’s wedding dress for her nuptials to Kanye West – and being an early pioneer of streetwear codes in the luxury arena.“Riccardo did an amazing job reinventing Givenchy while staying true to Givenchy,” says Ida Petersson, womenswear buying director at the fashion retailer Browns, who wants to see Tisci bring “some of that edgy romance that he does so well” to the house. “He was a part of the first wave of making the logo, T-shirt and sweatshirt a luxury item, so I’m looking forward to seeing what he does.”Tisci’s appointment doesn’t just mark a change in style, but in strategy, too. While the brand has stepped back from the controversial see-now, buy-now model it introduced in 2016, Tisci’s black T-shirt was made available for 24 hours and only available to purchase through its Instagram and WeChat (the Chinese multi-purpose app) accounts. It marks the first time that the brand has created a tailored digital selling experience on social media. Following the show, a number of additional items will be made available in a similar series of “24-hour releases”.“While the task of transforming Burberry is still before us, the first steps we implemented to re-energise our brand are showing promising early signs,” said Gobbetti. “With Riccardo Tisci now on board and a strong leadership team in place, we are excited about the year ahead and remain fully focused on our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable value.”Coincidentally, Tisci makes his debut in the same month that former Dior Homme and Saint Laurent designer Hedi Slimane – famed for his skinny suits and rock-star aesthetic – unveils his first collection for Céline, a house Phoebe Philo made famous for pared-back minimalism. From experience, Petersson thinks the appointments could bode well.“It’s always exciting to see someone new come in and make some noise. Generally speaking, our customers’ response has been positive when a new designer steps in and shakes things up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eff6f6aef7e2c3000f2b6d7630e443e299b0c4/887_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc49ee7d9e8736d1b8c66cd9bd22cde","title":"crazy rich asians review observer","story":"The clash between new and old money is explored in Jon Chu’s hilarious if superficial adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s bestsellerMuch has been written about the impact of Jon M Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s bestselling 2013 novel Crazy Rich Asians. Indeed, it’s not insignificant that the film is the first Hollywood studio movie to feature a majority Asian cast since The Joy Luck Club in 1993. Yet to evaluate it solely on the basis of representation\u0026nbspis to do it a disservice and to further narrow the parameters of how we’re allowed to talk about movies that feature “erse” actors.Chu’s film is somewhere between My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a Jane Austen novel: meticulous and hilariously alert to social structures, family dynamics and money, with a plucky underdog heroine. Rachel Chu (Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu) is, by her own admission, “so Chinese I’m an economics teacher with lactose intolerance”. A game theory specialist raised in New York by a single mother, she agrees to take a trip to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young (an extremely dashing Henry Golding) to attend a wedding and meet his family. Nick’s mother, the elegant, sneering matriarch Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), does not approve, for her son, as the title indicates, is crazy rich, creating an opportunity for Chu to explore new money versus old.As far as pure romcom spectacle is concerned, it’s a sugary delight a Chinese-language cover of Coldplay’s Yellow is gooey perfection. Golding has a real leading man quality and, crucially, nails the brooding smoulder. The writing is also very funny, particularly regarding Eleanor’s decidedly un-American cultural expectations. “Your room is ready … for you,” she tells her adult son.Still, this romcom fan had her reservations. Yes, the clue’s in the name, but the film embraces the idea of capitalism as inherently romantic, indulging in sweeping, swooning, tourist board-approved vistas of Singapore’s most luxurious\u0026nbspdestinations. Like the Fifty\u0026nbspShades of Grey movies, there’s so much glittering surface that it feels like the dazzle might be a distraction by design."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/484fe405717511944c77ecc8f7d9a8ea6117074e/0_42_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcd8083a8f414c1ecc8d4ce30bf0c8f6","title":"barack obama is not keen on pudding this means we can never be friends","story":"The best way to tell if you’re compatible with someone? See how much butter they spread on their bread and how often they order dessertSome people think the worst words in the language are “rail replacement bus service”. But not me. I think the worst words in the language are, “I’m not having a starter.” When my friend A asked for more butter in the restaurant where we had supper together the other night – the butter we’d already been given to spread on our sourdough had not yet, you understand, entirely disappeared, but as she informed our waiter, she wanted to be certain that more would be immediately forthcoming – I remembered all over again why we are such pals. She likes to eat. I like to eat. When we’re on the town, there will never come a time when she has to wait it out while I scoff, say, a small mountain of crisp, lightly battered squid. More to the point, I will never have to lie and insist that, no, no, honestly, I didn’t really want the crisp, lightly battered squid in the first place.To me, the way A eats speaks loudly of the rest of her: she is, in other words, generous, straightforward, easy in her own body, sensual, capable of just the right kind of extravagance. Also, witty (the waiter laughed out loud). But then, I’ve long read people by their habits at the table.I’m sure there are fussy types out there who are great fun theoretically, I suppose it’s entirely possible that someone with a morbid fear of pasta or cake might be neither clenched nor a tiny bit boring. Somehow, though, I can’t quite see it – and besides, how are you supposed to bond with another human if not over a plate of penne or parkin? Walking is good, but you can’t really do that at night. Sex is also good, but you can’t do that with everyone. Rule out these activities, and all that’s left of an evening, it seems to me, is to find a place where the salad is properly dressed and the waiter knows the meaning of the word “rare”, and to eat together, heartily.I’m not the only one who sees things like this. On holiday, a friend of a friend related for my amusement selected highlights from the recently published memoirs of the former French president, François Hollande. In the book, which is called, somewhat unexcitingly, The Lessons of Power, Hollande throws shade at Barack Obama by describing his distinct lack of enthusiasm in the matter of dinner. Apparently, he never once saw Obama have pudding. Even worse, offered a selection of magnificent fromages during a state dinner, the American president opted – c’est scandaleux – for only one thin slice of perfect ripeness, and there on his plate this pathetic sliver remained for the rest of the evening.What does this tell us about Obama? Perhaps it suggests to you that he wanted to keep his undoubtedly slinky figure. M Hollande, however, wonders if it doesn’t betoken a certain chilliness. The basic message is: surely a man cannot love life if he does not also love cherry clafoutis and Epoisses de Bourgogne?In truth, of course, this says as much, if not more, about Hollande than it does about Obama – and only good things, I think. Certainly, it puts his much-mocked outings by scooter to visit his lover, Julie Gayet, in a whole new light, or it does for me. At the time, I found it comical that his bodyguard would arrive the next morning bearing croissants such a pastry delivery service seemed a bit Pooterish to me, and therefore distinctly unsexy. (I remember sarcastically asking a friend if she thought he ever mixed it up by delivering the odd brioche or a couple of pains au chocolat instead.)But I’m with François now, all the way to the bistro and beyond. Appetite is so important. Just as you want a friend who likes butter on her bread, so you want a lover who thinks breakfast is worth taking time over. (And lunch. And dinner.) I’m not sure about crumbs in the bedroom. I’m fastidious enough to hope Hollande and his mistress got up to drink their coffee. But I am absolutely certain that a man who notices what another man leaves on his plate has some of his priorities right, if not all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a4aa334c82dace08bff7f6a9a201da791139bb/136_347_7119_4271/master/7119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f66758eae3bc0f96ad4cda99ddd9897","title":"rick astley tea boy pop star beer hipster","story":"From brewing tea for Kylie to brewing hipster beer in Copenhagen, the singer tells us about his unexpected life in food and drink My parents had another son before me, called David, who passed away, and I don’t think they ever got over it. My mum moved to my gran’s house a mile away and I saw her often – she’d sometimes come to the school gate at lunchtime. I lived in my father’s house with their other children and we had a housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who’d come and made our breakfast and tea. The food was northern and pretty basic.My earliest memories are of being a terrible eater. I would eat ham sandwiches, but not a lot else. By the time I was a teenager it was Pot Noodles big time. It was only when I went abroad to promote my records that I got fed up with asking, at best, for steak and chips, and I opened up to the possibilities of food. “Spaghetti vongole? It looks pretty strange, but I’ll try it!”My brother Mike was a bit of a beast, a tough nut, a bit of a bruiser. If I’d managed to get the last piece of chocolate, he’d snatch it off me. I remember once having a banana in my hand and Mike going past on a bike and grabbing it and eating it. We’re close nowadays, but I think that had been his way of finding a place in the hierarchy.Mike once challenged me to eat 20 Milky Bars in 20 minutes. I got to about 15 and then realised it wasn’t possible.It’s said that I was the tea-boy at producer Pete Waterman’s studio, brewing builder’s tea for Mel \u0026amp Kim and Kylie, but I was a junior tape operator who made everyone tea because that’s the sort of guy I am. It’s also claimed that I’d hold out tea to people and then snatch it back, singing, “Never gonna give you cup”, but that was a joke, by Pete probably. A couple of years ago, Mikkel opened a bar in downtown LA and it’s there I first tasted the beer inspired by me called Astley’s Northern Hop. We’re currently working on another beer in my name and opening a Mikkeller bar in Shoreditch.By the time I was 25 I probably had enough money to never work again. I retired at the age of 27, after my daughter Emilie was born, and I felt the pop business was daft by comparison. I’d had a rough flight back from Berlin and then I was going off to America to promote my first single there, and I had an emotional breakdown on the motorway, on the way to the airport. With tears in my eyes I turned to my manager and said, “I’m done”, and he said, “OK, we’re done”. He’s still one of my best mates and was the best man at my wedding.Lene – my wife and now manager – is Danish. We’ve always got liquorice at home –which isn’t sweet, it’s really salty. We often have brunede kartofler, which are sweet caramelised potatoes and they’re lovely if you’re not due a heart attack. My wife is big on fish, like most Scandinavians, and sometimes she’ll make curried herrings. It sounds dodgy but if you have them done properly with apple and boiled egg on a good rye bread, they’re incredible. Friends now arrive at the door and say, “Where’s your herring?”FoodI’d go for Italian. You can walk off a not-even-fancy beach and you can get a good bowl of pasta almost anywhere in Italy.DrinkYou might order a bottle of wine and feel an anticlimax, but a G\u0026ampT is hard to beat in every instance.Signature dishI call it football pasta – penne, fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, a bit of basil, a bit of pesto – and you cook and plate it in seven and a half minutes.

I must have got through my own body weight in them, but it wasn’t until many years later that I realised they came in versions other than the standard chocolate and whipped cream.Choux pastry can be daunting if you’ve never made it before, but follow the steps below and you should be fine. There will be enough here for a few extra shells, just in case a few go wrong in the oven.The trickiest bit in this recipe is getting the choux pastry right: the paste needs to be loose enough to pipe easily, but firm enough to hold its shape – a bit thicker than toothpaste. This isn’t a quick recipe, so you’ll probably want to set aside the afternoon. They’re worth the effort, though, and once you know how to make choux, you can go and experiment with all sorts of fillings and toppings.For the choux pastry75g salted butter60ml whole milk90ml water1 pinch table salt100g plain flour4 large eggs, 2 of them separatedFor the pear jam2 conference pears, peeled and grated (about 260g) – save 1 tbsp of juice in a separate bowl for the icing70g caster sugar70g light brown sugarJuice of 1 lemon1½ tbsp apple pectin40g dark rumFor the custard135g whole milk135g double cream20g cornflour2 large egg yolks(left over from the choux pastry mix)60g caster sugar60g light brown sugarFor the icing3 tsp lemon juice1 tbsp pear juice1 tbsp rum200g fondant icing sugarGreen food colouring (optional)Cocoa powder (optional)Start with the hardest part: the choux pastry. Add the butter, milk, water and salt to a medium saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a boil. Add the flour, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mix forms into a ball of dough. Now for the work! Set a timer and continue to stir for four minutes. This bit is really important, so don’t be tempted to skip this step. As you stir, it will gradually lose water, which will billow off as steam. Take the choux paste off the heat and tip into a mixing bowl to cool. There will often be a thin layer of paste stuck to the base of the saucepan. This is normal (though a bit of a pain to clean off) don’t try to scrape it into the dough.Beat two eggs with a fork, then separate the yolks and whites of two more eggs and set both aside. Gradually add the beaten whole eggs to the dough a little at a time, and fully mix in before adding more. You’re aiming for a cohesive paste with no lumps that’s easily pipeable but also holds it shape – something slightly thicker than toothpaste. I find that the amount of egg required can wildly vary whenever I make this. If you still haven’t got to a loose enough mixture after using both the eggs then add some of the egg white from the separated eggs.Heat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7. Pop the paste into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle and pipe straight lines of the choux on to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper. Dip your finger into some water, and use it to dab down the point of choux that will have formed at the end of each piped line. Bake the choux for 15 minutes, then take out of the oven, poke a hole in each choux case to allow the steam to escape, and return to the oven for two minutes more to dry out. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.While the choux is baking, make the jam. Put all the ingredients in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to a boil and heat for a few minutes until the water has boiled off– 104C on a thermometer. You can also test it by dropping a small amount of the mix on to a plate that has been chilling in the freezer - the surface should wrinkle slightly when prodded.For the custard, add all the ingredients to a saucepan over a medium heat. Stir constantly and cook until the mixture thickens. Set aside to cool.Gently fold together the custard and jam so that you can still see distinct pockets of each in the mix. Pop it, in another piping bag, snip off the end and fill each eclair through the hole you made to release the steam.Make the icing: mix the juices, rum, icing sugar and food colouring (if using), You can use a piping bag fitted with a flat head nozzle to pipe the icing on to the eclair. Or, for a more rustic finish, use a palette knife to spread it over the eclairs. Sprinkle over a tiny speckle of with cocoa powder using a small sieve or tea strainer to finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae01dd97cd12ddbfb513216a582a1ca409ef4a91/553_0_2601_1561/master/2601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4de50fba1d24ea83cc5efbb37987286d","title":"newcastle arsenal premier league report","story":"Midway through an initially awkward afternoon, Unai Emery was quite possibly bracing himself for the sort of uncomfortable post‑match scrutiny with which Arsène Wenger eventually became so wearily familiar.Emery’s Arsenal ended the first half seemingly barely able to string two passes together and apparently struggling to embrace their new philosophy of advancing with intricacy right from the very back.With Newcastle United pressing their guests into flustered submission, Rafael Benítez was winning his battle of wits with Wenger’s successor.Yet as good as Benítez’s tactical plan appeared, he lacked a striker sufficiently predatory to polish off Matt Ritchie’s stellar crosses and his playmaker Jonjo Shelvey was only fit enough for the bench.The scene was consequently set for Granit Xhaka to secure an ultimately restorative win by reminding everyone that a moment’s inspiration is sometimes all it takes to undo any amount of perspiration.If Emery’s introduction of Lucas Torreira helped Arsenal get a belated grip on midfield, Xhaka’s stunning free-kick changed the narrative entirely, prefacing an important – and judging by Emery’s body language, evidently stress-busting – visiting victory.With an elegant swipe of a Swiss boot, the harsh glare of the Premier League spotlight had switched to Benítez and his Newcastle United side’s haul of only one point from five games. That equals the team’s record bad start under Ruud Gullit in 1999-2000, but the context is entirely different 19 years on, no one expects Benítez, whose side have already faced four of the ision’s top six, to emulate Gullit by resigning.“We’re not happy, but I’m not concerned because I know my team really well,” said Newcastle’s manager. “We’ve been close, but now we have to make the difference in the final third.”Emery agreed it had been a chameleon-style Arsenal performance. “In the first half, we couldn’t control the match,” he acknowledged. “We couldn’t impose our ideas and we conceded a lot of counterattacking chances. The key was the first goal, but maybe Lucas gave us better balance.”Early-season top-tier statistics indicate that no goalkeeper has been more involved with his feet than Petr Cech but, despite this win, Emery’s commitment to playing out from the back remains a work in progress.Accordingly, Cech and his defence frequently looked hesitant as Newcastle bombarded their box.Benítez has a habit of approaching games against the ision’s elite with extreme caution but, here, he made a radical tactical departure that resulted in his unusually aggressive side harrying their visitors out of possession by pressing them high up the pitch and rudely interrupting their goalkeeper’s efforts to initiate those patient buildups.In marked contrast, Benítez’s side have played more long balls than anyone in the ision – Neil Warnock’s Cardiff included – and have enjoyed the least possession of any team.Such no-frills directness has, so far, hardly paid idends, yet with the decibel level rising every time Mesut Özil was bundled unceremoniously off the ball, it initially seemed the ideal way to thoroughly faze Arsenal.Yet, although Jacob Murphy’s ing header forced Cech into a splendid save, it tellingly represented the closest either side came to scoring during an opening half punctuated by the lack of a killer final ball. Murphy frequently accelerated behind Héctor Bellerín but he and his team-mates lacked the necessary subtlety to capitalise.Reprieved, Emery replaced Mattéo Guendouzi with Lucas in the midfield holding role and, shortly afterwards, all Benítez’s homework – and his team’s hard work – went to waste, as Federico Fernández fouled Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Xhaka stepped forward to curl a free kick, which Martin Dubravka touched but could not hold, into the top right corner from considerable distance.Significantly it was the afternoon’s first shot on target.The time had come for the suddenly influential Özil, liberated by Lucas’s arrival, to silence his doubters. When Alexandre Lacazette’s shot was blocked, the rebound fell for the German to apply the, typically accomplished, finishing touch.Perhaps disrupted by the injury-induced loss of Jamaal Lascelles, Newcastle were unable to sustain their early energy. They could easily have fallen further behind before Clark’s stoppage-time header afforded the scoreline a semblance of respectability, but provided zero Geordie consolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f761e0cbe80fafd145e35c8e635b37b965e19607/100_63_1690_1014/master/1690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f39f7f9b75f48e6572c54a7021f156d4","title":"watford manchester united premier league match report","story":"For all of José Mourinho’s obsession with the notion that everyone is obsessed with him, the Manchester United manager may be able to put what the rest of the world thinks to one side when he wakes up on Sunday morning and enjoy instead the simple satisfaction that comes with three points.Mourinho was chirpy as he mused on the ramifications of a narrow victory over Watford – one he acknowledged was a fragile win given how his team followed a dominant first half with a more passive second which required a trademark intervention from David de Gea deep into stoppage time to keep hold of the points. In keeping with their high-fashion kit, this result was coloured with a blush of pink relief.“Very happy with the points. Very happy with the spirit. Very happy with something that represents the spirit of the team – Romelu Lukaku’s sliding tackle after 50 metres running back to help the team,” noted Mourinho. His comments emphasised how much graft was required to get this particular result over the line.“I am a bit frustrated because we had everything in the first half to win the game. Then we stopped being aggressive with and without the ball, gave them a chance to be reborn and give us a difficult match.”Watford’s qualities showed their flying start to the season has been no fluke. Their state of blissful cohesion – so in the groove Javi Gracia has not felt the need to tinker with their starting XI at all so far – created a feelgood factor that was tangible.The stage was set for teams in slightly different moods to trade opportunities, to chase chances, to make the difference. Full commitment was on show. When one attack fell to Abdoulaye Doucouré, his shot shuddered straight into Marouane Fellaini’s block. It was a moment when you almost winced for the ball, caught as it was between two giants competing so earnestly.The game ebbed and flowed until United forced the issue and found a breakthrough in the 35th minute. It all started with a free-kick, won when Jesse Lingard was hauled back by Étienne Capoue. A scruffy affair ended up with Ashley Young’s whipped pass catching out Watford’s defence. The ball brushed Lukaku’s torso and drifted past Ben Foster and in. A goal off the stomach? They all count.United suddenly slipped through the gears and had a period during which they really sparkled. The second goal was delivered by Chris Smalling, who cushioned the ball on his chest before swivelling to slam the ball home.Mourinho’s touchline celebration was vigorous. “We trained the corner during the week and the best thing that can happen to coaches is you\u0026nbsptrain and then see it happen during a match.”During the 15-minute spell leading up to half-time Paul Pogba did his utmost to extend United’s lead with three dazzling attempts. Foster had to impress to keep the deficit at two.This was a huge test of Watford’s newly honed spirit. But their task was made even more complicated by United coming back out after the break intent first and foremost on staying solid. Pogba swaggered. Lukaku maintained a physical presence. Fellaini protected.In fairness to Watford their endeavour and approach in trying to build positive football did not let up even if the barrier was a difficult one to overcome. They were rewarded with a foothold back into the game, engineered by a smart passing move which culminated in the excellent Doucouré shimmying and picking out a perfect reverse pass for Andre Gray to plant past De Gea.Watford came again, and a warning light flashed for United when Smalling nudged at Troy Deeney as he looked to make inroads in the penalty area. Once upon a time a 2-0 lead for a Mourinho team was a dead game but this was prised back open, chances cropping up at both ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32ee02e35b7583e23fff302956c4184aa69c3bc6/0_10_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b7860bc3808ea2c48caed47922f35d4","title":"tapping up watford everton marco silva","story":"The most blatant “tap” I ever heard about goes back to the days when it was quite the norm for the members of the FA’s international committee to use their positions as a way of making clandestine approaches to players from the England team.It was June 1977 and England had just played Brazil as part of a tour of South America, minus Don Revie on the pretext the manager was flying off to watch Italy, one of their opponents in the World Cup qualifiers (in reality, Revie was negotiating his contract in United Arab Emirates as part of his own exit strategy). The players were relaxing by the pool at their hotel on Copacabana beach when Peter Swales, the chairman of Manchester City, wandered over, as bold as brass, to ask Mick Channon for a word under his own parasol. Everyone knew what that meant. “Off to Manchester City, Mick?” was the gist of it when Channon returned. And he was – his transfer from Southampton went through the following month.Nobody should be surprised. It’s been going on for years, decades even, and you have to marvel when the clubs who turn it to their advantage work themselves into such a froth of moral indignation when they get a taste of their own medicine.Liverpool, for example, when they cancelled a pre-season friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on the basis they suspected the German club had gone behind their back to try to entice Rhian Brewster away from Anfield. A victory for the greater good, you might think, if it were not for all that awkward business with Virgil van Dijk last year, when Liverpool ended up offering Southampton what is commonly known as a humiliating apology. Or the fact Liverpool were fined £100,000 and banned from signing academy players for a year, having been caught trying to poach an 11-year-old from Stoke City, promising to pay his school fees and, according to a considerable list of allegations, offering his family all sorts of other inducements including all-expenses-paid trips to tournaments abroad, £50 cash in hand for the boy every time he trained at their academy and the money to replace his father’s faulty car exhaust.Anyone with a long enough memory might also recall Liverpool’s previous with Christian Ziege of Middlesbrough, resulting in a £20,000 fine from the Premier League, or the pursuit of Clint Dempsey, when it needed a written apology to persuade Fulham to withdraw an official complaint, and wonder how many other players could be added to this list – including, if Arsène Wenger is to be believed, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.Wenger, of course, wanted everyone to believe Arsenal would never resort to these kind of tactics, wearing his halo so tight you wondered whether he might be in danger of giving himself a headache. Others within the sport would probably accept that every club breaks the rules this way, just some more brazenly than others. Alex Ferguson, fair to say, would have been at the higher end of the scale if you believe the story of him sending a Manchester United shirt to Joe Cole, then a teenager in West Ham’s academy. The shirt had the No 10 and came with a hand-written note saying: “This is your number when you play for Manchester United.”It is the same abroad, with considerable evidence that the leading Spanish clubs, in particular, regard the rules in the same way that Uri Geller used to view spoons: they are there to be bent. It is just the practice has changed over the years. Once, it would be the manager or chairman making contact with a player. Nowadays, it is a more convoluted process, involving a chain of agents and intermediaries. It is the same message delivered in a different way, to protect the people who would ultimately sign off the deal.It is also a routine part of daily football life, whether we like it or not, and I wonder how many clubs are currently rubbernecking in Everton’s direction, and thinking it might easily have been them, now the Premier League has commissioned an independent inquiry to examine the Marco Silva affair.Watford, presumably, would never dream of approaching another club’s employee and, having pursued Everton so vigorously over this complaint, they had better make sure that remains the case if they want to avoid allegations of double standards. Yet it is easy to understand why Watford feel so aggrieved and maybe it’s no surprise that the club at the centre of the allegations have not tried to persuade us they would never behave this way.Public denials can be tricky, I guess, when it is only a few years since Everton were fined £45,000 at another Premier League tribunal after inviting Jamaal Lascelles, then of Nottingham Forest, for unauthorised talks at Goodison Park, including a tour of the stadium and training ground. Or if you remember that when it comes to pinching another club’s manager Everton were landed with a £75,000 fine, plus £50,000 in compensation, for “indirectly inducing” Mike Walker to leave Norwich City in 1994. Everton, in short, have more tap than Tommy Tune, with separate allegations now also surfacing about an illegal approach to an academy player from Cardiff City in 2016.The question is whether football cares enough to shift this culture and, frankly, I’m not sure that battle can be won. Other measures can be put in place, however, and Richard Bevan, chief executive of the League Managers Association, says his members have been discussing whether a transfer window should be opened to determine when it is OK, and when it is not, for clubs to approach working managers. The idea would be to restrict movement to January and the summer, though it is hard to be too enthused. A better plan, surely, would be to impose the same rule they have in Italy to prevent anyone managing two clubs from the same ision in one season.In the meantime, Everton have apparently lodged a counter‑allegation that Watford offered Silva their manager’s job when he was still under contract at Hull City and, as such, that it is pretty rich for them to be complaining now. Even if there is something in that, however, it is undermined by the fact Hull have not issued a complaint. Watford have – and the Premier League could, in theory, deduct points if the verdict goes against Everton. Just as, in theory, Uefa could throw clubs with racist crowds out of European competitions, but never do. Far more likely, it will be a fine, again. A big fine, perhaps, but nothing too harrowing for a club of Everton’s wealth, with the fifth highest net spend in the league over the last five years (higher even than Liverpool).That is maybe the problem. The elite clubs are so rich these days, the only punishment that would truly hurt is a points deduction. In which case, a proper system needs to be put in place to deter the clubs. For a first offence, the relevant club would be fined and made to pay compensation. Another incident within a three-year period could mean, say, a point docked. And a third strike? It is all negotiable, but how about a three-point deduction and the threat of a one-window transfer ban?As it is, very few of these disputes even get this far and there has never been a single one that has resulted in anything but a fine. The world will carry on turning and football has got by so far without this kind of totting-up procedure. But is it any wonder, with the system we have now, that Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and all the other clubs with money might think it is worth taking the risk?Peter Beadle might not be a familiar name to everyone but there is a reasonable argument, based on pure win percentages, that he could be the most successful manager in English football.All of which us brings us to the newsflash on Hereford’s website that Beadle is now their former employee, eight games into their first season in National League North. “This is not a decision the board has taken lightly and it is made with a heavy heart,” the chairman, Ken Kinnersley, said of the manager’s sacking. “However, the directors are in unanimous agreement that now is the right time to make a change.”Kinnersley says the club’s ambition is to reach the Football League and, plainly, Hereford’s opening run of three wins, two draws and three defeats, leaving them in 12th position, was not good enough now we have moved into age where even the smaller clubs appear to operate on knee‑jerk reflexes.It’s even worse higher up and in the case of Manuel Pellegrini, four games into his role as West Ham manager, you have to wonder where it will lead if his team lose again at Everton on Sunday. West Ham have started the season with four defeats and the last time that happened, in 2010-11, they were relegated in bottom place. A fifth defeat would represent the worst start to a season in the club’s 123-year history and it won’t get any easier. The next two league fixtures will be against Chelsea and Manchester United.On the one hand, it feels ridiculous to be talking about Pellegrini’s job being under threat in mid-September. On the other hand, that is the narrative of modern-day football and I doubt Peter Beadle imagined, five weeks into the season, he would be turfed out either.For the sake of Charlton Athletic, a club that have endured enough, let’s hope it is not true Fawaz al-Hasawi, the bewildering former owner of Nottingham Forest and creator of what is known by the River Trent as the Carry on Kuwait years, is planning to bring his unique style of leadership to the League One club.Hasawi, pictured being shown round the Valley, made such a shipwreck of his previous club a reasonable argument could be made that his name should already have a large cross through it on what used to be known as the fit‑and-proper-person test.Unfortunately for Charlton, that would mean relying on the Football League and, having watched the club drowning under Roland Duchâtelet’s ownership, I wouldn’t hold too much confidence in the relevant people thinking it is time to throw a bit of rope into the water."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e9960a3d377bae707d2e6360c49051016b2474/0_124_2924_1755/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aa62084fbc7d2d94dba0ef7ea93cf56","title":"how audiobooks turned me into a runner at 50","story":"Tired of having to interrupt your routine to change the song? You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e62f6506dbad4919c144968845f5c8d3ff3b698/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d2d79e1205589c7481fb9d43e04cd82","title":"almost half of voters say they would vote for new party in election","story":"Neither Tories nor Labour offer a strong leader according to voters, Observer poll findsAbout two in five voters would be highly likely to vote for a new party in the political centre ground at a future election, a new poll for the Observer has revealed.It suggests there is appetite for a new party, with both Labour and the Tories suffering from long-running internal strife.

The party’s annual conference starts this weekend, but it has failed to capitalise on the isions inside its rivals.Speaking before his party conference in Brighton, Vince Cable said he wanted to “make an open pitch to the people of this country who are fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties”.“Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist, there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,” he said.Despite the difficulties that any new party would face, talk of such a move has not gone away. Some Labour MPs have privately said they will look again at the idea once Brexit has happened in the spring.Overall, the Tories retained their one-point lead in the poll recorded last month.

Foot successfully sued the Sunday Times when it published similar allegations 23 years ago.The story comes as Britain’s relationship with Moscow is yet again at a low ebb after two Russian nationals were charged over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Wiltshire. The pair have since said they were in the city to visit its cathedral.The original allegations about Foot date back to the claims of Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky, who alleged that the former Labour leader had received clandestine payments from the KGB and had been classed by the organisation as an “agent” and “confidential contact”.The fresh claim appears in a new book, The Spy and the Traitor, by the Times writer Ben Macintyre and also featured on the newspaper’s front page on Saturday.Kinnock said Foot had always been an opponent of the Soviet Union’s “internal and external despotism”.“He would never have served their purposes,” he said. “When these allegations were made against him in 1995 he sued the Sunday Times and won substantial damages. He has been dead for eight years. Repeating such claims without any substantive additional proof is filthy.”McDonnell told the Observer: “Michael Foot was a good and honest socialist whose only desire was to serve our country. Elements of the British media are sinking to new lows in debasing standards of journalism in this country. They used to be called the gutter press. Now they inhabit the sewers.”Corbyn tweeted on Saturday: John Foot, a great nephew of the former Labour leader, tweeted: “My great-uncle Michael Foot was a lifelong anti-Stalinist. Friend of Orwell ... Ludicrous to claim he was a Soviet spy. Sued successfully for libel around this when he was alive. No evidence. Shameful and cowardly.”Chris Mullin, the former Labour minister who worked with Foot, said he believed the claim was “cowardly ... given that Michael Foot is in no position to answer back”, adding: “He was a good, honourable man and a democrat to his fingertips.”Macintyre’s new book states that MI6 agents had been told about Gordievsky’s claims in the summer of 1982. It also says they concluded that Foot had not been a “spy or conscious agent”, but had been used for “disinformation purposes” and received the equivalent of £37,000 in today’s money.It says that they were prepared to warn the Queen, should Labour have won the election in 1983. “Within MI6 there were discussions about the constitutional implications if Michael Foot won the election,” it states. “It was agreed that should a politician with a KGB history become prime minister of Britain, then the Queen would have to be informed.”The Times’ coverage of the story suggests that, had the new revelations been known at the time that the allegations first emerged, “it is unlikely Foot would have resorted to the libel courts”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6b3c98c37d5ba3da331c541d5119959bf075c4/185_110_4045_2428/master/4045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39f9c13e7cbe74c154a8511ea44afa07","title":"sadiq khan new referendum peoples vote labour corbyn","story":"Mayor of London’s call for people’s vote adds to pressure on Jeremy CorbynThe mayor of London has issued a dramatic call for another referendum on EU membership, insisting that the people must be given the chance to reject a Brexit deal that will be bad for the economy, jobs and the NHS.Writing in the Observer, Sadiq Khan says that, with so little time left to negotiate, there are now only two possible outcomes: a bad deal for the UK or “no deal” at all, which will be even worse. “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods,” he writes.Khan says that backing a second referendum was never something he expected to have to do. But so abject has been the government’s performance, and so great is the threat to living standards and jobs, he says, that he sees no alternative than to give people a chance to stay in the EU.“This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the government, or a vote on a ‘no-deal’ Brexit if one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU,” he writes. “People didn’t vote to leave the EU to make themselves poorer, to watch their businesses suffer, to have NHS wards understaffed, to see the police preparing for civil unrest or for our national security to be put at risk if our cooperation with the EU in the fight against terrorism is weakened.”The intervention from one of Labour’s most powerful politicians will put yet more pressure on the party leader Jeremy Corbyn to throw his support behind another referendum at Labour’s annual conference, which opens in Liverpool next weekend.More than 100 anti-Brexit motions, and motions backing another referendum, or people’s vote, have been submitted by constituency parties – believed to be a record for any single issue in the party’s recent history.A large number of the motions are from the left of the party, and call for a commitment to a people’s vote to be inserted into Labour’s next general election manifesto.Sam Tarry, national political officer of the TSSA union, who used to work for Corbyn, said the left of the Labour party was uniting behind demands for another vote: “The sheer weight of anti-Brexit motions going to conference is unlike anything I have ever seen – and the only force in the Labour party capable of pulling that off is the left. The trade union movement has moved quickly towards an anti-Tory Brexit position this summer. There is this feeling that we, the socialist left, simply cannot stand by and watch while workers and communities are sacrificed at the altar of Tory dogma and imperial nostalgia.”Until now Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said they would prefer the public to be given a say on Brexit in a fresh general election, adding that, if one does not happen soon, the option of a second referendum should remain open. But leftwingers in the party now say this formula is not sufficient, and want a commitment to another referendum in the next manifesto.Alena Ivanova, a leading activist for the grassroots group Momentum in east London, said: “This is a campaign now being led by the left... Tory Brexit is a fundamental threat to the rights and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour represents, driven by bosses and rightwing ideologues. We will only stop it with unashamed leftwing internationalism and, crucially, that will also help us in the campaign to get the Corbyn government we need.”Recognition of the case for a new referendum also appears to be growing in Tory circles. On Saturday the Conservative MP George Freeman, a former chair of Theresa May’s policy board, said on Twitter that pressure for a second vote would become “overwhelming” should moderate Conservatives fail to shape a sensible Brexit deal.Theresa May will travel to Salzburg in Austria on Wednesday in another attempt to sell her Chequers deal on Brexit to EU leaders at an informal summit. Several European leaders, as well as the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, have already raised serious doubts about key elements of the plan.

The pair had agreed he should ride a lower gear and bide his time until the final laps, because the track was “heavy” and would tell on the legs of his bigger-geared rivals.The tactic worked to perfection but it relied on immense patience while other riders accumulated points for three-quarters of the race.Six months later, in the Tour of Britain stage finish at Haytor, Yates – still an amateur riding for Great Britain – bided his time again before\u0026nbspdestroying the strongest climbers in the professional field in the final kilometre.A similar approach seems to have worked in the last three weeks at the Vuelta a España, where Yates should – barring accidents – ride to the biggest win of his career on Sunday.Before the race, Yates’s directeur sportif, Matt White, said the goal was for his rider to finish the race strongly, no matter what the result, so as to put behind him the experience of the Giro d’Italia, where the 26-year-old dominated the first two weeks only to fall apart in the final four days. That approach called for Yates to curb his racing instincts, watch and wait, which he did until eight days out, when he took the race lead at Alto las Praeres.Yates’s Vuelta win will mark an unprecedented Grand Tour slam for Great Britain, coming as it does after\u0026nbspvictories in the Giro d’Italia for Chris Froome and the Tour de France for Geraint Thomas, but the Bury racer’s achievement has a significantly different background.Unlike Thomas and Froome, Yates was earmarked as a Grand Tour contender before he even turned professional, thanks partly to the Haytor result, but mainly to his stage wins in the Tour de l’Avenir, the Tour de France for under-25 riders.The first of those came in 2011, when he was barely 19 years old, in a\u0026nbspsprint finish ahead of a select group containing riders who figure in the hierarchy of Grand Tour favourites, names such as Nairo Quintana, Tom\u0026nbspDumoulin, Warren Barguil and Romain Bardet.It was the point at which Yates began to stand out, eight years after he and his twin brother Adam – prominent on team duty in this final week of the Vuelta – were taken to watch the Bury Clarion club riding at the Manchester velodrome by their father, who had come to the sport, as so many do, after an injury caused by running.The other major difference is that\u0026nbspYates’s entire career as a senior has taken place in what could be termed the Team Sky era the flagship British squad were formed in 2010, when he was 17. How\u0026nbspironic that the Yates brothers were overlooked by a team expressly set up to find and develop British Tour de France\u0026nbspwinners.With Sky only interested in Simon, and not Adam, the pair developed with the Australian Mitchelton-Scott squad, who have transformed themselves as they have matured. They have gone from a team largely built around sprinters to one who can sustain three Grand Tour campaigns in a season.While Yates’s talents on the bike have been obvious for five years, his character remains obscure. In interviews, he is polite, deferential, giving little away. He has become still less inclined to open up since the leaking of a positive drugs test for the asthma inhaler terbutaline in 2016. The test was punished with a slap on the wrist – a four-month ban – given it was owing to a clerical error on the part of his team, Yates having declared its use at Paris-Nice that year.A precocious talent then, who looked completely at home when thrown into the 2014 Tour de France at a couple of days’ notice, described by Newton in one interview as, “a racer not just a climber”, with the instinctive knowledge of when to make a move that comes with repeated distance racing on a velodrome.He is also, Newton observed, a rider capable of snapping occasionally when pushed, in a little outburst of aggression that is neither bravado nor rudeness but the natural reaction of a man at his limit.There has been little sign of that in the past three weeks, apart from an emphatic gesture at a non-working Quintana last Sunday at Lagos de Covadonga, but that figures, for if ever there was a victory\u0026nbspborn of cold-blooded restraint, it is this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d20bd156ed6cf75e8b331395c4ad955bf7e2569/576_512_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1582d8eb85ba210db1fe38c7dfaf908","title":"israeli missiles strike near damascus airport says syrian state media","story":"A Syrian military source claims its activated air defences shot down some of the missiles An Israeli missile attack targeted the Syrian capital’s airport late Saturday, activating air defences which shot down some of the projectiles, state news agency SANA reported.“Our air defences responded to an Israeli missile attack on Damascus International Airport and shot down a number of hostile missiles,” said a military source, quoted by SANA.The agency, without giving any information about casualties or damage, posted footage and images of air defences being activated. In the shaky video, a small, bright explosion is seen in the night sky, with city lights in the distance.Agence France-Presse’s (AFP) correspondent in Damascus heard a loud blast late Saturday, followed by several smaller explosions.The Israeli military declined to comment on the incident.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said Saturday’s strikes hit a weapons depot outside the airport. “The missiles, suspected to be Israeli, destroyed an arms warehouse near the Damascus International Airport,” Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. He had no immediate information on casualties.Israel has vowed to prevent Iran, which is a main backer of Syria’s government, from gaining a foothold in neighbouring war-torn Syria.Earlier this month, Israel acknowledged having carried out more than 200 strikes in Syria over the past 18 months, mainly against Iranian targets.It has also admitted to striking Syria to prevent what it says are deliveries of advanced weaponry to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an armed movement backed by Iran which fights alongside Syrian troops.The last reported Israeli strikes on Syria took place on 4 September, when Syrian state media said the military’s air defences downed several missiles in the coastal province of Tartus and in central Hama.The Observatory also reported those raids and said they killed three Syrian soldiers.Syria’s conflict erupted in 2011 and has since killed more than 360,000 people, with millions more displaced internally and to neighbouring countries.After losing swathes of territory to rebel groups, President Bashar al-Assad’s troops have regained the upper hand and are now in control of around two-thirds of the country. They were bolstered by nearly three years of air strikes by their key ally Russia, and Iranian, Iraqi, Lebanese and other foreign fighters on the ground.Soldiers and other loyalist fighters had been amassing around Idlib, the largest rebel-held zone left in Syria, for several weeks.But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denied that Syrian troops were planning a major offensive for the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4a378d986523bbbf56118d60ba50c9c3cc57f0d/7_271_4233_2540/master/4233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=006c9f99adf79189707f2441b0368afe","title":"pope tells sicilys mafia you cannot believe in god and be mafiosi","story":"Pontiff visited Palermo to commemorate Pino Puglisi, a priest murdered in 1993Pope Francis has appealed to Sicily’s mafia to abandon lives of crime and violence, saying the island needed “men and women of love, not men and women ‘of honour’”, using the term mobsters apply to themselves.Speaking on Saturday in the Sicilian capital, Francis said members of organised criminal networks – many of whom go to church and worship openly – “cannot believe in God and be mafiosi” at the same time. In his appeal, he referred to them as “dear brothers and sisters”.The pope visited Palermo to commemorate Father Giuseppe “Pino” Puglisi, a priest shot dead by mafia hitmen in 1993 after he challenged the organisation’s control over one of the city’s toughest neighbourhoods.Puglisi was killed on his 56th birthday during a bloody mafia offensive against the state and anyone else who threatened the group’s existence. Magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino had been killed in twin bomb attacks in Palermo in 1992.“A person who is a mafioso does not live as a Christian because with his life he blasphemes against the name of God,” Francis said in the sermon of a mass for some 80,000 people in the port area of the Sicilian capital.The crowd interrupted with applause each time he denounced the mafia.The Catholic church in southern Italy has had a chequered history of relations with the mob. Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini, who was archbishop of Palermo from 1945-1967, denied the mafia’s existence, considering communism the church’s biggest threat.“I say to mafiosi: Change, brothers and sisters! Stop thinking about yourselves and your money ... Convert yourselves to the real God, Jesus Christ, dear brothers and sisters,” Francis said in his dockside sermon.“I say to you, mafiosi, if you don’t do this, your very life will be lost and that will be your greatest defeat,” he said.“Today, we need men and women of love, not men and women of honour men and women of service, not of oppression.”Later, on his way to the airport, Francis made an unscheduled stop to pray and lay flowers at the spot on the highway where Falcone, his wife and three police agents were blown up as their motorcade passed on 23 May, 1992."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77aa3e5ef9ebaff7a6b14c6c11ee04537dfe7d13/0_88_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b72009dc9be2b92e501a4fd33aea47b","title":"return to refugee camps 30 years on dina nayeri","story":"Dina Nayeri was eight when she and her family fled Iran. Are today’s refugees treated with more dignity?There have been days, months, when I’ve eaten meals provided by charities, governments, good people. When I was 10, I lived in a refugee camp outside Rome, a temporary safe space for transients seeking asylum outside Italy. The Italian government had leased the building from a hotel owner though our clothes and sheets were those of refugees, we lived on a hilltop, in the husk of a pretty hotel.Each day, the residents of hotel Barba were served soup, pasta, coffee, meat, bread. In the mornings, we stampeded for jam. We were given three meals at precise times. When my mother found an English school an hour away by bus, we had to find a way to claim our lunches or they would be lost. She enlisted the help of an Afghan grandmother – she would save our lunches for us, we would eat them for dinner, then we would make sandwiches out of our dinners, hang them in a plastic bag over a balcony and take them to school the next day. The process was embarrassing and very visible. The bringing in of the lunches, now cold, to the canteen at dinner time, the packing away of the fresher dinners. The hotel served hard, round bread rolls and we filled them with peas and mashed potatoes, with pasta and chicken, slices of meat under carrot, letting the gravy soak and soften the bread overnight. To this day, leftover sandwiches evoke survival for me – they bring dread, the pleasure of having solved a puzzle, and also shame.A few years later, after my family had been granted asylum and sent to Oklahoma and I fancied myself an American teenager, I began volunteering at a local food bank. My friend and I were assigned to the storeroom. Poor mothers or single men would arrive in the front, sign in at the desk, tell their stories to more experienced volunteers, and we, the teenagers in the back, would receive instruction about which category of grocery bundle to make. Everyone got the same things, with a few extras for babies and some substitutions for allergies. They never saw our faces, the silly adolescents who flirted and sang while we chose their food: tuna or chicken, white or wheat, pulp or no pulp. I got rid of all the chunky peanut butter first, thinking I was being kind. I was grateful that I didn’t see their faces, that I could avoid the downcast eyes as I loaded their bags into open trunks.Accepting charity is an ugly business for the spirit. It rubs you raw, especially if you were once someone with pride and lofty goals, someone who shook hands and locked eyes. My mother and I used to talk about the irony of so many of the world’s refugees coming from the Middle East – we are such prideful people, and a refugee is the most abject creature of all: stateless, homeless, without control over her own food, education or health. Asylum seekers is so mild a phrase – we weren’t politely seeking, we were ravenous for it, this animal need for safety for our bodies. How do we survive the memory of it?After Oklahoma, I spent two decades working on my pride. I accepted no charity from friends. When we went out, I ate little. When one of their parents paid, it felt like a big deal, as if I had lost control. I didn’t borrow change for vending machines. I did accept the charity of universities, as it was hidden from view and kinder. Later on, I allowed men to pay for meals, telling myself that my company was enough to compensate – that this is how the world’s least indebted women behave and so should I.In my 30s in New York, I volunteered to help a friend, a well-meaning finance type, serve Thanksgiving dinner at a homeless shelter. I showed up in a stained T-shirt and old jeans, my hair in a ratty bun. There was no question of what to wear I knew that tonight I would offer food to a stranger, and that stranger would, for a moment, be humiliated. She would look at my clothes, my posture, for a reason to say: “Who cares what she thinks?” And it was part of my job to give her that reason quickly. I remembered that at hotel Barba, a young man serving soup would call out: “Zuppa! Zuppa!” He’d make a clown of himself, so we could laugh sometimes, he would sit for a chat, eat some soup, ask how we were. The zuppa man was beloved at hotel Barba and I imagined myself in his shoes. I stuck $10 in my pocket, leaving my wallet behind.But Manhattan do-gooders don’t know the quiet bargains that the poor make in the space of a glance. When I arrived at the shelter, my friend looked me up and down. “Are you depressed?” he joked, eyeing my stains. Behind him, bankers and lawyers in Chanel shoes and white silk shirts, leather handbags still on their arms, dished out mashed potatoes and uneasy smiles to tired men and women wearing the grime of the city. Later on, when the residents invited the volunteers to join their table (a plea for dignity), the volunteers declined out of concern (“Will there be enough?”). They dashed off to a fancy restaurant instead, ordered pork belly and congratulated themselves for not staying (“It would’ve been overstepping”), then complained about the tourists crowding the door. I confess that I ate a few bites of that turkey dinner, and I ate the pork belly, too, and I let my friend pay, humiliating as it was given my stained T-shirt, my sweaty hair. I hated him that night, but I was also grateful to be in his company. I went home and threw it all up.Now, a few more years have passed. I’m a writer in London, a mother, a confused immigrant. A lifelong chameleon, I’m reimagining my identity again. Am I still a refugee after so many years of assimilating?I spend a lot of time thinking about hotel Barba. In 2011, I went back. It had become a proper hotel, with pretty curtains and nice sheets. I know now that Barba was a “low hardship” camp. I hate that term. It’s condescending and a lie. The accurate description is that it was something other than hell. It wasn’t Moria in Lesbos, with its raw sewage and midnight wars, its five-hour food lines and shared tents on open soil. Officially, hotel Barba was a refugee camp. But I call it a hostel, because it wasn’t a camp. It wasn’t a hotel, either. The difference between each pair of words is subtle, a private calculation of shame and place and dignity.Late last autumn in a London cafe, I spoke with Paul Hutchings about life in the camps and the possibility of my returning to one. He co-founded Refugee Support, a charity that goes from camp to camp revamping the way they distribute aid. Right away, he started up about dignity and shame. Like me, he had stayed up nights thinking about humiliation. Hutchings met John Sloan in October 2015 while volunteering in the Calais camp. The two men noticed that the act of offering food and clothing, these undeniably first-order needs, had become so urgent and frantic that the “how” was forgotten. The only people who seemed aware were the refugees Hutchings saw it in their eyes, in their gait. Though they had already lost so much, they were losing more with every jacket tossed from a truck-bed and every ill-fitting pair of trousers they would have to barter away. In Calais, provisions were handed out from the backs of vans. One day, a van would arrive with, say, large jackets and park in one part of the camp. Another day, a different van with men’s jeans, or T-shirts, would park in another corner. Refugees lined up as a volunteer tried to keep order, and another asked their size. They received one item and were asked to go. Some tried to negotiate, claiming to have a sick friend, a parent too weak to stand in line. Others fought and yelled and grabbed. Items were trampled on the ground. Some went away empty-handed. No one felt good about what had just happened.“Wouldn’t it be nice,” said Hutchings in the cafe, “if we could give people food and clothing without taking away their dignity?”“Why is that so hard?” I asked.“Because people want every hour and dollar they give to be stretched thin.” Hutchings told me that his biggest problem was the volunteers, donors, and their lofty expectations. Many donors want to assign criteria to how their food is given out. They want their money feeding as many as possible, to make sure you spend it only on eggs and bread. They want to police. They don’t care about the “how”. Even the most good-hearted volunteers want to feel thanked. Refugee Support began its work in April 2016 at Alexandreia camp near Thessaloniki, Greece. They set out to open a food store, then a clothing store, a well-designed, peaceful marketplace stocked with donations, where a person of note wouldn’t be ashamed to shop. When Hutchings showed me photographs, I thought: my mother, an Iranian doctor, would shop there. My grandfather, a landowner, would be proud to run into a neighbour there. It was a far cry from the item-specific trucks.At first, residents made appointments and collected prepared baskets of food, thoughtfully arranged with necessities for each family. Everyone received the same thing, regardless of allergies, habits or taste. But people didn’t have the same needs, and soon there were grumblings, barter, waste.Hutchings and Sloan decided to display the goods and give people the respect of choosing for themselves. The store’s currency would be points distributed weekly like income – 100 points per adult, 50 per child, 150 for pregnant women. Store prices would be pegged to market prices (20 points per euro). Sanitary items would be free. If residents wanted to spend all their points on chocolate spread, they had that right.On his phone, Hutchings showed me designs for Katsikas, the newest camp, near Ioannina, closer to the Albanian border than to Athens. He spends time thinking of the aesthetics, whether people will like it – he cares that they like it. He has sales data, too, and a list of what he needs to stock each week. Yes, the customers (his word) buy some butter biscuits, but they don’t sacrifice milk for it.“You know what I love?” Hutchings asked. “When they complain about the selection. Because that means they’ve forgotten they’re in a camp. They’re just people in a store, with money in hand, complaining about yoghurt.”“I want to go,” I said.“We have rules,” he said, “We need to keep absolute equality between people, so there’s no hint of special treatment. We don’t allow socialising or friendships. Volunteers can’t even accept a cup of tea or enter the private rooms.”“Are there Iranians there?” I asked. “Or Afghans who speak Farsi?”“There will be at Katsikas when it opens,” he said.“I want to go without your rule,” I said, thinking of that long-ago turkey dinner that everyone turned down. If this is about pride, I have to be able to accept a cup of tea.“The complicated thing is that dignity changes as different needs are met,” Hutchings told me a few weeks later, as we drove on a pitch-black highway, slick with rain, away from Athens. “When you arrive from Lesbos, dirty, tired, starving, dignity is that package of shampoo, deodorant, eggs, coffee, bread. So we offer that on arrival. Then, when you’ve showered and slept and cleaned up, that package becomes humiliating. You want your tea, not coffee. You remember you hate eggs. That’s when you want choice. After you’ve lived in a camp for a few months, the store with fake money and strict friendship rules becomes humiliating, too. Why can’t you befriend the clerk? There’s a shelf-life to this. We don’t stay at any camp because we don’t want to contribute to the camp becoming permanent.” We were visiting two camps on this trip, but our ultimate destination was Katsikas. I had put on a brave, eager face, but I was afraid of what I would see and remember.Just before Christmas 2017, 450 refugees from 10 countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, arrived at the empty camp at Katsikas. Awaiting them were Isoboxes, residential containers in a gated field, each kitted out with kitchenette and bathroom, beds on metal frames. Almost everyone was arriving from Moria, the hell in Lesbos, and from similar inhospitable camps on the islands. The store staff prepared for opening day. No one expected chaos they knew that when you grant people dignity, they become dignified. The refugees walk through the store, looking they choose olive or sunflower oil, the one they prefer. They are treated as the doctors and teachers and craftsmen they once were.On my first day, the store opened as usual, 10.30am until 1pm. It was clean and whimsically decorated, with cheese graters as light fixtures, little plants here and there, vegetables neatly piled in rows. It looked like a food cooperative in south London. An iPad served as the sole point of sale, though later a second “register” was added with pad and paper. Behind the produce was the storeroom, left open so volunteers could fetch nappies and extra bags. No one worried about theft. Outside, a long hallway featured art by camp residents, including a haunting sketch of a laden boat at night, refugees on open water. Tables and chairs were set up where families waited their turn. Here was the first difference between this store and any other: only one family could shop at a time.Another point of difference: no one, no matter how compelling their story, ever gets an exception. On my second afternoon in the store, a young couple, newly pregnant, came back after their shop. The husband said he counted the items and it came up 50 short. Nothing could be done. “It’s not about the inidual,” Hutchings said. There could be no whiff of case-by-case judgments, or the possibility of favouritism, on the camp.For most of my time at the store, I bagged groceries, just as I did in Oklahoma. This time, I had no say in what went into the bags. But after the second family passed through, I noticed other peculiarities of this store: in a way, we did tell them what they could have, because we controlled the points. The envelope full of paper money is largely symbolic, since almost everyone spends all that they have on the first market day after the points are issued. They hand over the entire envelope and the volunteer keeps track of their shopping. At some point the volunteer says, “Only 10 left” or, “You’re 10 over”, and the family begins to make trade-offs. Private discussions are had. Children jump in, biting their nails. Juice boxes are sacrificed.The first time this happened, I realised I had bagged too soon. I had been over-zealous. I had to stop, wait to see what would be put back. I had bagged the children’s bananas, and now I remembered how rare bananas were in Iran, how desperate I had been for them and how that desperation lasted all through my teenage years, after bananas became ordinary. I wanted to ask Hutchings if we could just let them have it, but stood by, feeling useless and ham-fisted as the parents explained that the bananas would have to go back.Later on, as a young Syrian mother and I were trying to arrange her six sacks in a chubbily occupied buggy – the baby leaning forward, accustomed to sharing his space – I heard the familiar, easy sounds of Farsi. An older Iranian couple entered, handing over their envelope (200 points, no children). I listened as they spoke in the language of everyday shopping. “How much” is this or that? “Is the olive oil worth the price?” It was beautiful to enter this brief fantasy. For 10 minutes, they were a couple in some European city, doing their weekend shopping.Then they went 10 points over. The wife bit her lip. “We have to put the biscuits back,” she said.The husband scanned the items.“But we’d be five under.” I imagined them back in their Isobox with their cups of tea, the cardamom they had smuggled from Iran. Butter cookies are just the thing with tea.They took a tomato paste and stood at the register.Then I did something stupid: I said hello in Farsi, wished them a good day. They stared at me, stunned, said polite hellos. I realised I had punctured that brief fantasy of a normal life that Hutchings had envisioned perhaps this was the reason for the no chit-chat rule. The fact that I had understood their private negotiations made plain that they were part of a charade, that this was a charity shop. I begged the universe to rewind by five seconds, to make it so I wasn’t the same as those Thanksgiving volunteers in New York, the ones whose help had come at such high costs.I started bagging their things and, for a second time in my life, was glad for having dressed shabbily.When the store was closed, I walked through the rows of Isoboxes, knocking on doors. It was intimidating and thrilling. Again, I asked myself, what the hell am I doing? Who would answer? Would they speak Farsi? Would they invite me in? I memorised the door numbers for the Farsi households.A kind couple in their 30s opened the first door. I had found them through their daughters, who were playing soccer outside. I’d heard delighted shrieks in the language of my own childhood, and made a beeline for the sound. “Are you police?” the older girl asked. “No, I’m an Iranian lady looking for other Iranians.” She gave me their Isobox number. The parents invited me in. Hutchings sat with us, happy to listen without understanding as they told us the story of their escape. After several hours, the talk turned to the store and they said something I would hear from every other Iranian at Katsikas: get basmati rice. They pulled out the rice from the store, then the rice they had bought with their own money. The husband compared the grains. “See how much longer?” Hutchings nodded. It was simply that a volunteer had found a good deal on this rice. “Can I come back tomorrow?” I asked the couple. “Yes,” the husband said. “Actually, you will come back thrice. Things always happen to us in threes. Three boats before Moria. Three tries before getting here. Always three.”Before we left, they showed us videos of Moria, toilets overrun by sewage where people also bathed, tents on raw earth, children begging to leave. The husband asked for help with the immigration process. I didn’t know what to say – the photos were scenes from a nightmare, and I felt so obtuse for having revealed my own asylum story. Hutchings kept his face neutral. “I’m sorry, we can’t help. We don’t know asylum law. Yes, we’ll look into the basmati.” Later, he told me that it’s a mistake even to provide reassurance, because the residents grasp at every hope. The videos and pleas for help happened in every Isobox I visited.By now, we are accustomed to horrifying footage from refugee camps. We forget the psychological damage of purgatory. This waiting space, in which you can never go back to your old life and identity, but haven’t been told yet what your new one will be. Will your children have to learn German, Italian or English? Will you work in your old profession again? Will 2030 find you lecturing in a university again, or driving an Uber, washing dishes, cleaning homes with a fraction of the books you once owned? These questions torture the mind, yet the world says: “They made it out! They’re safe. We did it!” Then they toss food out of truck beds, provide shelter in tents. But charity and welcome are different things.The next day, I knocked on a door and found a group of women having tea and rolling dough. They were Afghans and Iranians, and immediately they called me inside. They had heard about me. They gave me tea. I made myself comfortable on a pillow between two motherly ones. They had an old pasta maker acquired in Ioannina and were turning all their flour into pasta. They pointed to a small room where thin ropes of dough were drying on a bedframe, the mattress stashed away somewhere. “This is for Iranian noodle soup,” said one of them. “We’re making enough for everyone.” The women told me that every night they got together in someone’s Isobox for prayer and dinner. I promised to join them. Later that night, I found the same group, with their daughters and granddaughters, including one who had been born in the camp, having a birthday party, dancing and cheering.Before we arrived at Katsikas, Hutchings and I had stopped at LM village, near Kilini, a camp that Refugee Support had just left. Perhaps it was better for me to see the ghost of the store before I saw the living one. I wanted to go there because it was built in the carcass of an old holiday village, much like Barba. I hoped that it would rub away my calluses and I’d regain something of those days. Hutchings’ store was a shambles, clothes trampled on the floor, children rummaging through, a Greek worker on her phone, oblivious. Hutchings walked through the wreck of the store he had built, shaking his head, his shoulders dropping.The commander of the camp followed us around, nervous. He thought that Sloan and Hutchings had left because of his behaviour and he was trying to appease. They hadn’t, of course. But he was a fiery sort, and when Refugee Support left, the refugees barred the gates in protest, thinking the commander had shut the store down. He turned to me as we walked: “Dina, when you’re in the car, tell him every 20 minutes to come back to LM.” He was silent for a while, then said: “Tell him every 10 minutes to come back.”Hutchings didn’t respond. He seemed to be working through larger questions. Was his hard work gone? Did the refugees carry it away with them, their spirits stronger now?At LM, we ate with a Syrian family. The commander joined us. We couldn’t bear to touch the meagre food, knowing it had been bought with precious euros. But the family had refused to let us go the elderly mother of 10 grabbed my backpack and held it to her breast. We would have insulted them. This wasn’t like that New York Thanksgiving: they needed this food. Nevertheless, pride wins over hunger and we stayed.On my last day in Greece, as the store was closing and I was saying my goodbyes, a bewildered man in his mid-40s wandered into the waiting area. I could tell by his face he was Iranian. I greeted him in Farsi and he looked relieved. He said he had just arrived. He had no clothes, no food. He wasn’t registered at the store yet. The volunteers looked at his papers and agreed to keep the store open so he could shop. They told him to return at 3pm and they would open the men’s clothing store so he could have his 10 items. He was larger than average. I hoped he would find something.Since he knew nothing of the point system, I helped him choose his food. He got eggs, rice, a kilo of bananas, oil. Then he put back the oil. He got cookies and pistachios, milk. He put back the milk. He didn’t get much else. As his last 20 points wouldn’t buy oil, he bought four juice boxes instead. He left happy, nodding his thanks to everyone.As I started for the car, I thought of how nervous I had been to revisit this strange waiting place, this limbo that had shaped me, that was now shaping thousands of others from my home. We would be for ever linked and defined by it. And how much I had forgotten that was now clear and urgent. I remembered something else. I ran back into the camp, found a door and knocked. I had knocked on this door twice already. Yesterday, the husband had said, “No need for goodbye. Remember? Everything happens in threes.” Now I stood at that family’s doorstep a third time, waiting to be invited in. No one answered. A neighbour poked a head out and said: “They’re out. Maybe playing football.”“OK,” I said, “I guess I have to come back then.”“Next time in England,” she said, as she receded behind a makeshift curtain, and I recalled that we used to say that, too.• Dina Nayeri’s book The Ungrateful Refugee will be published next year by Canongate.Commenting on this piece?

I have never see flash flooding like this in our state.”According to the South Carolina Office of Emergency Management, Hurricane Florence has claimed its 6th victim. A 61-year-old woman died in Union County when her car hit a tree that fell in Hurricane Florence, according to South Carolina Office of Emergency Management spokesman Antonio Diggs.This is the first death reported in South Carolina linked to the storm. Five people have died in North Carolina.Heavy rain bands are sweeping the Carolinas and forecasters say the potential for flash flooding from now through Sunday morning is extremely high over much of the region.I-95 is the nation’s busiest highway, end to end. It serves over 110 million people and according to the I-95 Corridor Coalition, the road facilitates 40 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Florence has rendered several stretches impassible, and according to authorities that could remain the case through the end of the weekend.Sections which are currently alright are also likely to flood as rainfall continues and rivers swell in the coming days.Khushbu Shah is back in Rice’s Creek, the tiny community in North Carolina that she visited earlier this week, as the storm approached:Rice’s Creek is up 15ft since Wednesday, Alex Tatum thinks, standing where his girlfriend Mandi Dreeland stood just days before. Only the tip of the sign is poking out from the water and in a few hours, it may be completely submerged. The rain hasn’t let up for the better part of three days, with huge log jams of water across all of the yards.Their double-wide trailer has held up for the most part. Creating a fort with four couches, Dreeland spent the last 24 hours without power, going through the yoohoo supply and five packs of Marlboro menthol blacks. It’s pitch black in the home, but dry. Three coolers full of beers, Dr Pepper and Mountain Dew line the wall.“Tim Buck and his family just left,” Nicole Tatum, 49, tells her son as she walks over to his house from hers, in flip flops and mascara, under the deluge of rain. She whips out a picture of an alligator on the bottom of the steps to the entrance to Tim’s backyard. The water has reached one of his buildings. She has come over to tell Tatum and Dreeland she will cook a meal, with her generator running.“I’ve packed up all of our papers, computers, jewelry, pictures, letters from my mom, to keep them off the ground in case it starts flooding,” Alex’s mother says.Tatum’s stepdad, Chris Hamrick, lists off all the food they’ll put on the grill later: pork chops, chicken, baked potato and corn.“The power went out at 5.38am,” he says. “I know ’cause I got up to pee.”“You’re gonna get real wet,” Raymond Hill says, watching from his porch.The remaining hurricane watch group put on rain boots and coats to head to Hamrick’s dad’s house – his father, who has one leg, left on Thursday morning – and fire up the generator. Tatum’s mom stands over the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. All the while, the rain continues its steady onslaught over the “town” of Rice’s Creek.Our Adam Gabbatt has this update from coastal South Carolina. Him and Oliver Laughland are on their way inland now where Florence continues to mete out punishing rains:In Conway, eight miles north of Myrtle Beach, the smaller creeks which run into the Waccamaw were already swollen and had broken their banks in some areas.By Saturday morning a normally tranquil stream known as Crab Tree swamp was flowing fast and was just a foot from engulfing a bridge which provides north-south access to Conway. David Hudson, a 29-year-old road construction worker who lives in Conway, had stopped his car on the bridge to film the water flow.“I’m surprised this is that high,” Hudson said. “There’s usually walking trails down here. They’re underwater now.”Hudson wasn’t overly concerned about his own home, which he said is 12ft above the flood plain. But having lived in this area a long time, he predicted the flooding would worsen over the coming days.“In about four days when all the water comes down from North Carolina, that’s when we’re going to have a problem,” Hudson said.Crab Tree swamp had already flooded the woodland either side of its water flow, and a number of houses and buildings seemed vulnerable if the rain continues.In downtown Myrtle Beach branches from palm trees lined the main street, while on the waterfront the wind was blowing hard along the sand, whipping it up into the air.The water was a heavy, foaming swell, crashing against the columns of the deserted Second Ave Pier. Few people had ventured out – most heading warnings from officials to stay inside – but Aaron Lucas, a 38-year-old photographer and Uber driver, was standing on the beach with his camera.“You want to see what’s going on, what all the fuss about,” Lucas said. “There’s nothing like staring down mother nature.”Lucas, who lives three blocks from the beach, has not evacuated due to fears about being allowed back into the city.“I’ve evacuated before and that was one of the worst things I ever did. Because coming back in can be a nightmare. It drains your funds, your energy,” Lucas said.Accoring to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Florence “still hasn’t moved much”. Rivers all over the region are expected to swell by frankly incredible amounts as inland rainfall eventually drains out to the sea, a process which could extend well into next week.The Little River at Manchester, North Carolina is forecast to break it’s record flood level of 32.19 ft by an additional three feet by tomorrow.There are at least 28 river gauges in the Carolinas (some measure the same river in different places) expecting flood stage water levels in the coming days.Rescue teams in Jacksonville, North Carolina are using dinghys to navigate otherwise impassible stretches of highway.North Carolina governor Roy Cooper warned in a Saturday morning press conference that: “areas that never experienced flooding before may experience it now.”“Avoid complacency,” Cooper said. “Even though the storm has been downgraded, the rainfall will still be epic.” The flood danger from the storm is more immediate today than when it made landfall 24 hours ago. We face walls of water. More people now face a threat than when the storm was offshore. Flood waters are rising and if you aren’t watching for them, you are risking life.”Cooper said that beyond the five confirmed deaths due to the storm in the state, “more are being investigated”.Khushbu Shah is in Wilmington, North Carolina, near to where Florence made landfall on Friday. Saturday morning with the wind and rain subdued, she captured some of the aftermath.In 2016 Hurricane Matthew unleashed a torrent of rain over North Carolina, flooding the Pugh family out of their 2 centuries-old home. A total loss.Last month, the Pughs finally moved into a new home they’d built on the same piece of land. They were barely settled in when Hurricane Florence took aim at the North Carolina coast.“We’re still trying to recover,” Pugh said Thursday as he worked to secure a grill and other loose items in a shed before the storm hit. “Going on two years and here comes another hurricane.” Read more from HuffPost on the town of Fair Bluff where dozens of houses remain abandoned from the damage of Matthew, and how people there are dealing with Florence.South Carolina Highway Patrol says it has responded to more than 100 reports of trees down overnight.Rainfall totals in Swansboro, North Carolina have hit a record setting 30.58 inches thus far, with rain likely to continue through Tuesday. The previous record for rainfall from a tropical system was 24.06 inches from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The preliminary measurements are subject to revision, but it’s a pretty safe bet at this point that Florence will outpace that amount by a significant margin. Looks like rain, deer.Welcome to our continuing live coverage of Hurricane Florence, the tropical system which has been battering the Carolinas since Wednesday night and is expected to deluge inland areas for the next several days with historic amounts of rainfall.Here’s what we know as of Saturday morning:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3628160.1536846331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dyscalculia why maths doesn t add up for some of us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Kids who can’t learn arithmetic are regarded as being stupid. But they’re not – they’ve got this rather selective deficit,” says Brian Butterworth, professor of cognitive neuropsychology at University College London.Do you find it impossible to calculate tips in restaurants? Does the prospect of calculating how many tiles you need for your kitchen fill your with dread? Do you struggle with calculating change? Have you always struggled to remember maths tables?Then, there’s a chance you suffer from dyscalculia, a specific learning disorder in maths.This week, researchers in Northern Ireland published research which found that many children are suffering from this developmental condition but are not aware of it.A team of academics at Queen’s University Belfast examined the performance of more than 2,400 primary schoolchildren and found that some 112 children had a specific learning disorder in maths.However, just one of these children had been previously diagnosed with dyscalculia.The prevalence of the condition is estimated to be about 6 to 6.5 per cent. While this rate similar to dyslexia – which affects reading and spelling – there is far less awareness of dyscalculia.In fact, the research team estimates that a child with dyslexia is more than 100 times as likely to receive an official diagnosis and educational support than one with dyscalculia.So why are so few children being diagnosed?Máirín Barry, a former lecturer on special education needs at the UCD school of education, says there is far less awareness of the conditions even among specialists.While it was first identified in the 1970s, there is still relatively little known about dyscalculia. “We have a lot of catching up to do in terms of our understanding of dyscalculia,” she says.“The priority was literacy – to get everybody literate and able to leave school with the ability to read and write.“Dyscalculia is much more hidden because people accepted that not being able to read and write was a major obstacle, but not being able to do maths is much more socially acceptable.”If it is diagnosed at a younger age by an educational psychologist, there are techniques to help children to develop a better “number sense” through use of physical counting materials.The education system, she says, doesn’t always recognise this.“You’re trying to make sure that numbers seem real to children – because they find them so abstract. They have no real sense of numbers.“So, our support systems needs to be more open-minded in helping these children to get a better understanding of numbers.”Without learning support, numeracy problems can be reinforced at school. “Traditional teaching methods, while very effective at developing calculation skills if you have a good rote memory, tend not to develop good understanding of maths,” says Barry.“This continues through the system, and you end up with people who in their daily lives agonise over how to pay a tip or how much material to order.”Another issue, at least in the past, is the rigid, diagnosis-driven way special education supports have been delivered. Up until just over a year ago, schools were not able to apply for resource-teaching hours for dyscalculia.Under a new system, schools now have much more flexibility to use supports depending on the level of need in the classroom.Among adults, dyscalculia can be hard to spot as it is compounded by other factors, such as maths anxiety and poor teaching methods. The issue of hidden difficulties with numeracy also raises the wider issue of maths anxiety.Many adults presented with a maths problem either clam up or else proudly wear their poor maths ability as a badge of honour.Dr Pádraig Kirwan, head of Waterford Institute of Technology’s department of computing and mathematics, sees this regularly among Irish students. “In China and other Asian countries, they don’t seem to have this an issue on anywhere near the same level. Maths is a treated like a subject in the same way as any other.”He suggests there may be cultural or teaching issues that lie behind some of the wider anxiety around maths.Kirwan, for example, recalls his daughter being taught a basic maths technique in primary schools that was wrong. “I was able to correct it for her, but other children in the class didn’t have the benefit of that.”For those who genuinely suffer from dyscalculia, it presents real lifelong problems.Research in the UK has shown that adults with numeracy problems – of which people with dyscalculia are one group – are significantly disadvantaged.By the age of 30, those with low numeracy have lower employment prospects, earn less, are more likely to suffer from physical and mental illness and are more likely to get in trouble with law.There is often a general assumption that women are affected more than men, and that maths and maths anxiety contribute to the barriers that keep women underrepresented in the Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths).In the case of dyscalculia, however, Dr Kinga Morsanyi – who led the team of experts from Queen’s University Belfast’s school of psychology behind this week’s research – says they found no gender differences, either in the prevalence of dyscalculia, or of exceptionally high performance in mathematics“In society, there is sadly a widespread notion that you need a special talent to be good at maths, and that struggling with maths is normal for some people, but this is not the case and it’s not something we would accept if a pupil was unable to read,” she says.“It is important to raise awareness of dyscalculia, as numeracy difficulties often lead to problems in later life, including greatly reduced employment opportunities, increased health risks and an increased risk of involvement with the criminal justice system.”Brian Butterworth, professor of cognitive neuropsychology at University College London, and an expert in dyscalculia, has said the biggest challenge for dyscalculia agrees that getting wider recognition for the condition.“Kids who can’t learn arithmetic are regarded as being stupid. But they’re not – they’ve got this rather selective deficit,” he told The  recently.“Recognition would mean that sufferers would have access to specialised help, just as sufferers from dyslexia do. Specialised help would raise their mathematical competence and make them more able to cope with the demands of a numerate society.”"},{"url":null,"title":"housing activists stage sit down on luas tracks in dublin city centre","story":"  September 13, 2018Balaclava-wearing garda\u0026iacute helping remove protesters only inflames an already tense situation   September 13, 2018Notice says if the protesters fail to leave the property, the owner would seek an injunction   September 13, 2018Protesters clash with garda\u0026iacute as men in balaclavas eject group from city centre property "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3629655.1536946768!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps call for ban on irish fishing vessels after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue.  Photograph: Chris FurlongGetty ImagesIrish fishing vessels should be excluded from UK waters as soon as Britain leaves the European Union next March unless the Government resolves a dispute over fishing rights, a committee of MPs has recommended. In a report on fisheries after Brexit, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee says Ireland’s unilateral suspension of a mutual fishing rights deal was causing hardship to fishermen in Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court ruled in October 2016 that the so-called Voisinage Agreement, an informal arrangement dating from the 1960s and limited to small fishing vessels, had to be provided for in legislation if it was to continue. The Government introduced a bill to address the issue but its passage through the Oireachtas was delayed after fishing groups warned that its wording could allow large British vessels to fish in Irish waters.“We are disappointed that the Voisinage Arrangement has been unilaterally suspended in Ireland. While Irish fishermen have access to waters in Northern Ireland, fishermen in Northern Ireland have suffered hardship through exclusion from their habitual fishing grounds. This needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency,” the committee’s report says.“We recommend the Government structures talks with the Irish Government to establish the future of reciprocal access for Northern Irish vessels under the Voisinage Arrangement. “If the Irish Government does not give a clear commitment to pass, within six months of publication of this report, legislation which restores reciprocal access, the Government must discontinue access to UK waters for Irish vessels from March 30th, 2019. “If the Irish Government does pass legislation to reinstate the Voisinage Arrangement, then the UK Government should consider whether the arrangement should also be put on statutory footing in UK law.”The report also calls for an early resolution to the dispute between the British and Irish governments over the delimitation of maritime borders in cross-Border Loughs Foyle and Carlingford.

They have all previously won first prizes in their home country’s national science competition the equivalent to the BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition in Ireland.This year’s BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition winner Simon Meehan (16), who discovered a natural antibiotic in a blackberry bramble near his home in Ballincollig, Co Cork, was among those setting up projects on Friday.He has expanded his research since his win in January by focussing on the key natural “phyto-chemical” he found, which kills bacteria. He has established that the biggest concentrations are to be found in the plant in early summer but they are influenced by meteorological conditions and climate change.Higher yields were found in natural plants compared to commercial blackberry varieties which, he suggested, may have important lessons for the development of new antibiotics.Nearby, 15-year-old Rhea Mahotra from the Moravian Academy High School in Bethlehem, Philadelphia, was putting finishing touches to her presentation on the use of non-invasive laser technology on heart tissue.Her research, which was conducted on the fruit fly, has possible applications in quicker development of cardiac drugs, she said, and in the use of “optogenetics” where light-sensitive proteins can be activated in the heart, thereby adjusting various functions.Daniel Kang (16) from the John F Kennedy High School on Guam island is paying his first visit to Europe. Like his US colleague he was a category winner in the annual Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.He has developed an electrically conductive paint “that can change any surface into a touch sensor, circuit or battery”. Unlike most electronic material it is very cheap. He hopes the material, which is already “patent pending”, will have a lot of applications in waterproof, “wearable technology”.The competition, which promotes collaboration and innovation across borders, is being staged in Dublin for the second time in its 29-year history.

Photograph: Kirsty O’ConnorPA Wire.The European Union should make Britain an offer over Brexit to put an end to the “paralysis” of the UK government, Tony Blair has said.The former Labour prime minister said Europe should step in when asked what the EU can do to help Britain break through its political impasse.He told the Open Future Festival, organised by the Economist: “I think there is paralysis in the British Parliament, my view is they should make us an offer.”Mr Blair said there was a “fundamental dilemma” which the past months of negotiations had never resolved, which was either stay close to Europe or break completely with the single market and customs union.The latter, he warned, would be economically damaging.The former Labour leader continued: “I personally think there is a paralysis in Parliament, the best response would be to go back to the people and say ‘look, we have had two-and-a-half years of this negotiation, we now know all the options, do you want to proceed or do you want to stay’”.Britain is due to leave the EU in March next year, but no deal on how that will happen is in place after months of negotiations.Mr Blair, who is staunchly opposed to Brexit, also implored conference attendees to abandon adversarial finger jabbing and help rebuild the “politics of optimism” and “bridge building”. “I think the problem is when we look for people to blame, whether it’s business on the left or immigrants on the right, rather than understanding that this is a world of change and we need to master it.”Mr Blair said the deal should address Britain’s concerns around freedom of movement and immigration, which are also an issue “all over Europe”.The “underlying grievances” that led to Brexit could be dealt with without leaving the union, he said.He said: “None of the problems that Britain has and the challenges it faces are going to be easier to resolve out of Europe. They are actually going to be easier to resolve in Europe.“And the thing that pains me is when you have a young working class person in north of England thinks they are more likely to get a job if we stop some Polish guy coming and working in a bar in London.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

For example, at a family meal.“Make sure all computers are switched off at least two hours before bed time. Don’t allow internet access in the bedroom, particularly not mobile phones, and all mobile phones – including mum’s and dad’s – get left on the kitchen table when you go to bed.”Mr Bauckham was speaking as he continues to advise on the new RSE lessons, which will be made compulsory in schools from September 2020.The classes will see pupils as young as four\u0026nbspbeing taught about the perils of “pervasive” social media and encouraged to take time offline.UK news in picturesThe Liberal Democrats party conference began today in Brighton.

Negotiators have tried to publicly one-up each other with jaunty gifts of walking poles and mountaineering guides, adding a bit of colour to an otherwise dry saga.It is in that spirit that Theresa May will travel to Salzburg in the Austrian Alps next week to meet EU leaders in search of a breakthrough. In Westminster, the meeting has been much hyped. But she may leave on Thursday feeling like she has hit another false summit.The PM will arrive with the fundamental principles of her Chequers plan having already been put to the sword by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The British government still insists the plan lives, blames Barnier’s “dogmatic legalism” for dismantling it, and hopes to engage directly with national leaders who it sees as a softer touch.\u0026nbspThe big hope for the UK is that after a frank discussion, member states will soften their instructions to Mr Barnier so that he can make concessions. But the convenient narrative of governments aghast at what their negotiator is doing doesn’t seem to accord with reality.\u0026nbsp“Legally the Commission doesn’t need a new mandate,”\u0026nbspone senior EU diplomat said, speaking ahead of the summit. “The Commission needs a mandate for the withdrawal agreement and this is what they have.“I don’t see a situation where Michel Barnier says, ‘I’m fine with the mandate’, and the heads of state give him another one. If we should give additional guidance – and that is a big if – it would only be done in concerted discussion with the Commission.”Other Brussels sources point out that there cannot even be any change to Barnier’s mandate at Salzburg, because it is an informal summit and doesn’t have the legal power to make instructions. Any change agreed informally would have to be passed next month, at the October European Council. Britain may be barking up the wrong mountain.I don’t see a situation where Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsays ‘I’m fine with the mandate’ and the heads of state give him another oneIf there is one concrete thing the prime minister might get at Salzburg, it is yet another summit. Proposals have been floating around in Brussels backrooms for a dedicated Brexit meeting to be held in Brussels in mid-November – a date increasingly seen as a new deadline for a deal (RIP\u0026nbspOctober).This looks increasingly likely, simply because of time constraints. Salzburg isn’t about Brexit: it’s supposed to be about internal security and border control\u0026nbspand Britain’s departure is expected to get two hours over lunch. After Salzburg, the next time leaders meet will be the October European Council in Brussels. But a significant chunk of that meeting will be taken up by Asian presidents and prime ministers\u0026nbspwho will be in town to talk trade and investment. Once again, Brexit could take a back seat. After that, it’ll be December – which the EU has long insisted is too late.While being told to “come back in two months when we can fit you in”\u0026nbspmight be embarrassing for Ms May, it would also buy her more time – something that is running increasingly short after a paralysing summer.The prime minister should expect a warning from leaders in Salzburg about the need for a solution to the Irish border. But to sugar that pill, they may yet manage to summon up some warm words about Chequers – perhaps on security, or the fact it recommends a free trade agreement. There is practically zero chance they will endorse its single market for goods proposals, or its customs plan, however – the two major sticking points. But with any declaration on the future relationship now widely expected to be a vague fudge anyway, that might not matter.“They are looking for something positive to say,” one official says. “Carrot and stick.”While the focus in Westminster has very much been on Chequers, it is Ireland that needs to be solved to prevent a no deal. Sources in Brussels have for months suggested the Commission is working on a new version of its ‘backstop’\u0026nbspto prevent a border. But what form it will take – and whether it will be any more palatable – remains to be seen. Work on that was delayed because Britain was slow to hand over data relating to existing checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea – on which the Commission wants to base its new proposal. It may not be ready in time for Salzburg, but it will be crucial for a deal.Despite its limitations, the British strategy of trying to go over the Commission’s head to member states continues.

A majority of 52 per cent – an increase of nine points – said they would now think of giving their vote to a new group, and just 25 per cent said they would not.People were also asked if felt well represented by the current political parties, with 40 per cent saying in April that they felt very or fairly well represented, while 41 per cent said they were not very well or not represented.Raab picks row with John Lewis to ert attention from Brexit messEurostar \u0027will not run\u0027 if there is a no-deal BrexitTories backing far-right Orban to boost Brexit, says Muslim councilGovernment releases latest tranche of no-deal papersConservatives accused of seeking Brexit favours after backing OrbanBrexiteers call for end to talk of leadership challenge amid splits But by September a significant shift had occurred, with just 35 per cent saying the felt represented and 48 per cent – almost half – saying they felt isolated from the parties currently campaigning for votes.It comes after months in which Labour has been consumed by a discrimination crisis, with Jeremy Corbyn being forced to apologise after the party sought to alter part of the internationally recognised definition of antisemitism.Frank Field MP resigned the party whip after 39 years amid the row, citing allegations of bullying among members, while just last week ex-prime minister Tony Blair said: “This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know.”Other MPs are also said to be considering resigning the whip, believing that the left is now so firmly in control of Labour that its dominance cannot be challenged.antisemitism, claims rabbi Jonathan SacksAsked if people would support a Labour split, 33 per cent said they would to some extent, 30 per cent said they did not feel strongly either way, 20 per cent said they did not know and just 18 per cent said they opposed it.For those who voted for Mr Corbyn’s party at the 2017 general election, 32 per cent backed a split and 33 per cent opposed it, with 24 per cent not feeling strongly either way and 12 per cent not knowing.Asked whether people would consider voting for an ‘independent Labour’ MP, who disagreed with Mr Corbyn on key issues, 35 per cent said they would, and 42 per cent said they would not and 23 per cent saying they did not know.At his party’s conference Mr Cable will flesh out a call for\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat\u0026nbspsupporters to be able to vote in the party’s leadership contests for free as part of a plan to turn it into a “movement for moderates”.The Lib Dem leader wants his party to adopt a “registered supporter” system that would allow non-members to help decide who takes over from him.In a sign that Brexit isions have left the Tories creaking at the seams, a handful of MPs including former ministers Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry, and Heidi Allen have said they will quit if ex-foreign secretary Mr Johnson becomes leader.Source note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,533 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspSeptember.

That follows the near-collapse of hundreds of services following the introduction of new timetables in May. In the same month, the failing East Coast Mainline had to be taken under public control for the third time in a decade.These trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this weekendAnger as Northern Rail axes dozens of trains for third Sunday in a rowAndy Burnham calls for Chis Grayling\u0027s resignation over Northern RailTheresa May \u0027considering major review of future of railways\u0027London\u0027s new Crossrail network hit by huge delay before it even opensLabour has said the franchising system does not work and has promised to renationalise the railways if it gets into power.But the government claims privatisation has helped transform the industry.Its review – set to be announced by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, on Thursday – is expected to examine how issues such those faced by the East Coast Mainline can be avoided in the futureThis week the transport select committee described the bid to run the service by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains as naive and said the Department for Transport must take the blame for not managing it effectively.Mr Grayling himself has also faced questions over his handling of the disruption faced by passengers on Thameslink and Great Northern trains following the introduction of new timetables. The Office of Rail and Road has already launched an inquiry into the chaos.A DfT spokesperson said: Privatisation has helped transform our railway, doubling passenger numbers and delivering more services, extra investment and new trains. We are absolutely committed to improving journeys and are always examining ways to improve how the railway serves passengers.Reacting to the news of the planned review, Labour reaffirmed its pledge to bring the railways back under public ownership.UK news in picturesThe Liberal Democrats party conference began today in Brighton.

It is brave and it is self-aware to realise that more of the same in contemporary British politics isn’t going to cut it.“The bit I don’t like is that it is called this ‘movement for moderation’. Part of the problem is that the centre feels too insipid, too safe, too boring, too politics as usual, when in fact centrist thought, and small ‘l’ liberalism, can give rise to radical ideas that disrupt elites, disrupt closed shops, ideas that can really change things. That is the market in which the Lib Dems should be operating.”Another former Lib Dem staffer thinks it is not only the as yet unlaunched supporters association that will soon be needing a new name. It will be the whole party itself:“All this stuff, having registered supporters, changing the rules so a non-MP can be leader, they’re setting it up so that the party can be negotiated away into a new party. You don’t change the rules so that a non-MP can be leader unless you’re thinking about closing the party down.”Becoming the home for the army of radical centrists that must, surely, be out there somewhere, is one thing, but there are more pressing problems that\u0026nbsppeople inside the party have come to think might not be solvable.“There has been polling done to work out whether the party is toxic, and the results suggest it is,” said a former adviser. “The polling company, Populus, one of the seven groups they break the electorate down into is ‘left-wing intellectuals’.“They used to be our core vote. ‘Left-wing intellectuals’ voted for Charles Kennedy when they didn’t like the centrist Labour Party. They were the main swell of support. Those people are gone. When we polled it in February 2017 we were at 10 per cent with them.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union “It means we don’t really know what we are any more. Are we like the German FDP? Sensible, reliable\u0026nbspand an adjunct to government?“Or are we a Charles Kennedy style opposition party that opposes everything?“Kennedy constantly attacked Labour from the left, on civil liberties, on Iraq, on detention without charge. That stuff chimed with the voters we then lost in 2015, and they haven’t come back. They are now enamoured with Corbyn.“That was our base\u0026nbspand the polling shows we have become toxic with them. The party’s soul is with Charles Kennedy, but the future of the party is as an FDP.”The idea of setting up a registered supporters association, which is what ‘Momentum for moderates’ would be, is something that the party has considered doing for years. Tim Farron looked into it even Nick Clegg looked into it. Party insiders suggest Sir Vince now imagines it will be his legacy.But they still fall well short on quite what a ‘Momentum for moderates’ would do or stand for.\u0026nbsp“If you want to talk about the need of something new in the centre, it can’t be an existing brand,” said one former Lib Dem adviser, who worked for the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, during the years of coalition.“You have seen movements everywhere, whether it’s Macron, Momentum, or the alt-right in America, movements that work in conjunction with, alongside, in support of, and parallel to politicians have had success.“But what we need is to be more radical about the platform, the offer to voters.“Look at Labour under Ed Miliband. You’d see people from the left writing a 5,000-word essay in the New Statesman\u0026nbspon\u0026nbsp‘why Labour must have something to say on immigration’. And everyone agreed, but then they didn’t have anything to say.\u0026nbsp“The problem you might have is that everybody will say, ‘the centre needs to be more radical’, everyone will agree, but then you won’t have any radical ideas or policies.“People need to work out what the big spending measures the party would take are, what new environmental policies.“It might seem very Lib Demmy, but people actually do moan about how parties don’t represent them, about how the voting system is unfair and all that, so that is an area where we could offer change.“There are lots of people in Westminster, in and around politics who, if not sympathetic to the Lib Dems themselves are sympathetic to Lib Dem ideas. There’s environmental charities, people who are interested in the reform of broken systems like tax, or the electoral system.“And it just has got to feel a bit younger, a bit edgier. That is where Momentum has had success. Momentum is viewed as being only young people, but it really isn’t. It’s full of all sorts of people, some of whom have been around for decades, but the way they put themselves across makes people think it’s young and edgy.”Next weekend at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, you can be certain that hundreds if not thousands of the nation’s youth will assemble for an eve of conference rally, fully energised, mobilised and committed to the Corbyn project.But Liberal Democrats do not feel their chance has passed.How the Lib Dems will overhaul the broken immigration systemThe time to form a new centrist party is nowLet non-members vote in Lib Dem leadership contests, Cable saysLib Dem leader Vince Cable denies he is planning to quit partyFormer Lib Dem HQ now palatial £36m Westminster mansion with 10m pool“Not everyone under 25 in Britain is a socialist, or attracted to pretty hard left views,” said one former staffer. “But they do want some kind of significant change, and most of them want no Brexit so there is a market there.Privately, Lib Dems hope that ‘Momentum for moderates’ might attract 100,000 members. But if the party decides it wants to survive the party will need to change too.“They’ve got to overhaul the party’s processes,” said one ex staffer. “Things like the leader not being able to sack anyone. And the leader can’t set policy, which means they can’t announce policy.“We will see how we get on in the Sunday papers. But if you’re not in power and you can’t announce policy then what have you got to offer the media? They’ll just go to Labour instead.\u0026nbsp“Who will the interviews be with on Sunday, Vince or Keir Starmer? If it’s not Vince then we’re not in the conversation any more.”The Lib Dem fightback has been promised at every party conference since 2015 and, over the coming days, don’t expect 2018 to be any exception. But the starting point gets further away, and the questions more challenging. It will need plenty of momentum, and there is no time for moderation.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg  width= 1966  height= 1474  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg","title":"wetherspoons price rises brexit no deal tim martin","story":"Created with Sketch.Pub chain said it will hike prices rather than cut costs on staff and serviceClick to followThe IndependentWetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for no-deal BrexitJD Wetherspoon has reported a jump in sales in the last year, but warned prices are likely to rise over the coming 12 months.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were stunned.“The tension No10 is under trying to make the disastrous Chequers plan work is clearly getting to some of them.”The senior official last night adamantly denied making the comment.But he did admit using sarcasm during the dinner that “could have been wilfully misunderstood”.A No10 spokesman said: “It is 100% nonsense and did not happen”.Sources close to Mr Raab insisted it was “utter rubbish” that he is conspiring with Mr Barnier for a customs border down the Irish Sea, or that he has gone rogue during talks.Mr Raab and Mrs May are in lockstep over her red line not to see the UK ided up in any way by the Brexit deal, the source added.It emerged yesterday that British negotiators have handed Mr Barnier new data about internal UK trade, on his request.The figures give a detailed breakdown of the volume and type of trade in goods that takes place between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Ireland’s ambassador to the EU, Declan Kelleher, said Mr Barnier wants the data to show his version of the backstop won’t create an Irish Sea border.He said: “The backstop in no way changes the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK. It’s not a border down the Irish Sea.“Essentially it would involve addressing issues such as technical controls at the ports between Northern Ireland and Great Britain which already exist.“Nothing revolutionary is being proposed here, it’s simply a question of building on what’s already been achieved.”An EU source told The Sun that officials would look at it with a view to seeing whether checks could be moved away from the border or aided by technology.They said: “We can’t de-dramatise it by ourselves. We’re still open to the UK coming with something but as time goes by it looks less likely.”A second source added: “The UK has provided us with some of the data, which we’ll look at together with them.“This data will be helpful to better understand trade flows between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.”British negotiators have reportedly given their EU counterparts assurances that they will compromise on the backstop after the Tory party conference.But EU officials are still wary of the fact that any compromise on the border could be torpedoed by eurosceptics.A diplomatic source said: “The real question is what will happen with the domestic dynamics in the UK.“The Tory conference is a huge political risk factor to the final stage of the negotiations.”Mr Raab and Mr Barnier held their weekly talks over the phone yesterday after plans for a face to face meeting were cancelled.The Brexit Secretary said: “While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a field and the Germans had deliberately flooded it with water from a nearby river.“When I dropped into the water I wasn’t aware of anyone near me at all. It was quite some time before I linked up with anyone else.“It was quite hazardous, 192 men from one battalion died in the area. But I managed to survive it.”Read loved parachuting, but he was forced to leave his regiment after injuring his leg during the war.He was awarded the Chevalier award by the order of the Legion d’honneur two years ago for his heroism.The vet now plans to jump again next June after being told he has the “heart of a 40-year-old man” by a doctor.He said: “I did not like my first jump in the 1940s, but I liked the second and the subsequent ones.The parachute regiment jumped the night before D-Day to try and destroy the guns that could target the British troops on the Normandy beaches. They took the Germans by surprise when they the seized bridges within ten minutes of landing. These imperative missions lead the Allied forces to a successful mission that became a turning point in World War Two.“There was not very nice people waiting for me last time I jumped.Read completed his jump to raise money for the Salvation Army’s child abuse and human trafficking programme.So far he has raised £4,330.71."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000325016043.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ex rbs chief fred goodwin pension pot","story":"The disgraced chief executive - dubbed Fred the Shred - was widely considered to be responsible for the banks near-collapse in 2008.When he stepped down that same year, he was stripped of his knighthood and agreed to a £200,000 reduction in his pension entitlement.But the Mirror reports that he enjoys a £450,000 a year pension, as well as raking in £6million since quitting a decade ago - with a £2.8million lump sum.Robin Hood Tax campaign director David Hillman told the newspaper: “Goodwin ­symbolises the height of ­unfairness.“After driving his bank into the ground, he walked off with a golden handshake.The newspaper claims the 60-year-old is continuing to live the high le, despite millions of people being more than £23,000 worse off every year on average following the financial crash.He was apparently seen driving a £12,000 rare 1988 BMW 635CSi near his large home in the Grange area of Edinburgh.Goodwin was cleared of any wrongdoing over the collapse of RBS by the ­Financial Services Authority.The 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers, unleashing a wave of market turmoil across the globe.In a bid to save the UKs financial system, RBS was rescued from the brink of collapse by a government bailout.Earlier this week, RBSs chairman Sir Howard Davies admitted it is unlikely taxpayers will get back all the £45.5bn pumped in to the bank.He said restructuring costs, losses on loans and selling businesses meant RBS was valued at less than taxpayers paid for their stake.Looking back on the decade since the financial crisis, he told a lecture that the government is unlikely to recoup its investment in full.Though formally cleared of any wrongdoing Goodwin is currently being sued for up to £3billion by Taiwanese ­shipping magnate Nobu Su for allegedly using his companys cash to keep the bank afloat before it collapsed.The billionaire chairman of Today Makes Tomorrow , accuses Goodwin - along with two ex-colleagues and the bank itself - of hijacking TMTs accounts and using them as unlimited cash machines.Between 2007 and 2009, when RBS was on the brink of disaster, the tycoon claims Goodwin siphoned off billions of dollars without consent.It is the second time in as many years that Goodwin has faced a potential trip to court due to his role in RBS near-collapse.In 2017 he escaped being summoned to the High Court as a witness after thousands of shareholders who complained of being misled into buying the banks shares accepted an out-of-court deal with RBS."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433786634.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uranus examiner newspaper split with readers","story":"Locals in the town of Uranus plumped for the cheeky title — but district officials think they’ve dug themselves into a hole.Luge Hardman, mayor of neighbouring US city Waynesville, says she will not be placing official notices in the publication.She stormed: “I’m sorry but the innuendo of that title puts my city up for public ridicule — and I will not be a part of it.”The weekly publication will replace the defunct Waynesville Daily Guide when it goes on sale in south Missouri next month.Managing editor Natalie Sanders said of the title: “We thought about Constitution but most people who love us and who were part of coming up with the name, liked Examiner better.”The town of Uranus, with 25 residents, is used to poking fun at itself.Businesses include the Fudge Factory And General Store.

The ­family’s beloved pet dog was also killed by deranged Michael Stone.Josie herself was left with such severe head injuries that medics at she scene thought she was dead before finding a faint pulse.This little girl was a fighter.It must have been horrendous for both of them.Josie couldn’t speak for a year after the attack, had to have an operation to put a titanium plate in her head and her recovery was slow. It was all about small ­victories, and it was down to the tenacity of a little girl who just wanted to live a normal le.Now she is flourishing.Josie has become a successful artist, is engaged to her soul mate Iwan Jones and recently bought the family home in Wales where she spent her early childhood before they all moved to Kent where the attack happened.The house is full of happy memories and Josie dwells on events like her mum bringing home Rosie the pony when she was just five years old and teaching her to ride.Rosie is now a grand old lady of 27 and one of the most ­important things in Josie’s le.The feisty little pony is a link to her mum and little sister and played a massive part in her recovery. Learning how to ride again gave her confidence and a sense of freedom.Josie graduated with a degree in graphic design in 2009 and built up her own art business, first by selling handmade cards at fairs and now producing beautul ­textile landscapes.I’ve met Josie several times over the years, most memorably shortly after the accident when she was still coming to terms with the double tragedy of the death of both her mum and sister.She was shy and wary but gradually I gained her confidence and we spent a lovely afternoon together with her dad Shaun and Rosie the pony.I caught up with her again this week, and I’m always struck by her positivity and her refusal to be thought of as a victim.She very much lives in the moment and always tries to seize the day and be positive.Josie is a walking testament to the power of the human spirit and her mum would be very proud of her beautul, talented, happy daughter.LOTS of speculation already over who will be heading Down Under for I’m A Celebrity in November.Names being bandied around include EastEnder Danny Dyer, Corrie’s Michael Le Vell and former Strictly pro Brendan Cole.GMB’s Kate Garraway is keeping mum about rumours but she would be a hoot, although the person I’d really like to see there is my pal and TV colleague Dr Hilary Jones, who we’ve mocked up in the jungle, pictured.A team player and an action man, he also has a filthy sense of humour, doesn’t suffer fools gladly and would dispense medicine and advice when the insects start to bite and tummies get upset after being fed a diet of ostrich bum.And at the risk of objectying the good doctor, I would pay good money to see him in his skimpies having a shower at the famous waterfall.The ambitious project was first discussed in 2004, when I was rector of Dundee University. It’s wonderful to see it spring to le.Inevitably, costs spiralled. But hopefully the increase in tourism, business and the jobs created will more than offset the £80million price tag.As a proud adopted Dundonian, I want the V\u0026ampA to be a museum for everyone. I hope schoolchildren will enjoy the exhibits, friends will meet there for coffee and everyone in Dundee will think of it as their own.It’s here and I can’t wait to celebrate.IT’S a bit icky – and frankly unbelievable – that Corrie has Jim McDonald pretending his current girlfriend is his dead daughter in order to wreak revenge on his clan.More Game Of Thrones than a game of dominoes down the Rovers... and I can’t take it seriously., so I am.

I’m sure you recall Emmerdale’s Paul Lambert, who made a huge impact during his five years in the Dales.Paul was played by the ridiculously handsome Mathew Bose, who must have a painting in the attic because he hasn’t aged a day since leaving school.Surely his  is long overdue. His family are still in Emmerdale, including dad Rodney Blackstock, auntie Diane Sugden and his half-sisters. There are lots of layers to Paul, too.His alter-ego is drag queen Thelma Louise, while he and his boyfriend Jonny were the first characters in a primetime drama to have a civil partnership, back in 2008.Surely such an interesting character should be welcomed back to Emmerdale with open arms.We will know more tomorrow night, but I’m spending far more time than is good for me speculating about how it’s all going to be resolved.IT’S been a long time since I considered Jacob Rees-Mogg an amusing anachronism, a bit like a pocket watch.Behind this softly spoken throwback to the Victorian age is a flinty hard-liner who would deny a raped woman the right to an abortion.He’s hell-bent on a rock-hard Brexit, and he doth protest too much about not wanting to be Prime Minister for it to ring true. So it’s fair to say I’m not a fan.But I was appalled by the rude, ignorant mob of “class warriors” who heckled his kids and their elderly nanny outside the family home this week.It was cruel, savage and out of order. Rees-Mogg has chosen to be a politician and is used to being barracked.His children, however, are NOT public figures. They are little kids, who looked scared by the thuggish behaviour of the idiots, who did their cause no good at all.They were there to protest about the minimum wage, and one of them shouted at the children that their nanny, Veronica Crook, wasn’t paid very much to “wipe their bottoms”.Veronica, who has been with the family for half a century, was not best pleased by this, and in a brisk, no-nonsense way defended her boss and ushered her charges indoors. You got the feeling she would dearly have loved to give the protesters a very hard stare and sit them on the naughty step.Politicians from all sides expressed their disgust but those responsible don’t think they have done anything wrong.The minimum wage is well worth fighting for, but not like this.The demonstrators managed to humanise Rees-Mogg, and gained him bucketloads of sympathy.

May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Franchises are regional monopolies with no need to compete — all of them vulnerable to union blackmail.It is high time Transport Secretary Chris Grayling got to grips with it.THE Lib Dems won’t fool anyone with the “rebranding” Vince Cable fancies.The “New Liberal Democrats” would not be new, liberal or democratic.Reheated Blair ideas aren’t new.A party committed to state regulation of the Press and maintaining the EU’s protectionist trade policies isn’t liberal.And champions of democracy don’t fixate on overthrowing the biggest ­ballot box ­mandate in our history.Back to the blank slate, Vince.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

including its long, twig-like fingers - meant that it was often considered as evil and needing to be killed on sight.The animals were even so rare they were thought to be instinct in 1933, but were rediscovered in 1957.Now, there are 24 aye-ayes living across seven US zoos, with the number in the wild unknown.Tonks - whose name is inspired by the Harry Potter series - was born to mum Bellatrix and dad Smeagol on August 8.Ms Sturges said Tonks mum had at first not shown typical mothering behaviours, with the keepers stepping in and feeding the baby every two hours.She said: We have proof that mum caught onto the nursing thing.Shes gaining weight even without our help.Likening Tonks big ears to that of Mickey Mouses, she added: The primate team is enamoured and in love with Tonks.Everyone has had a part in helping her succeed.Were so happy that shes actually thriving.Aye-ayes live off of seeds, fruits and fungi, with their young kept in nests until they are able to survive themselves.They spend most of their time in the trees -

There should’ve been a vet on the scene straight away.“There should have been intervention prior to this horrendous situation and, at the very least, immediate action should have been taken after the birth to establish why it occurred.”Humane Society International’s Wendy Higgins added: “This is a devastating, rare insight into the shockingly poor existence of animals at this zoo.[They] are confined to heartbreakingly small enclosures, often almost entirely barren, in which all they can do is pace or swim the same circular route.The barren zoo was opened in 1959 by Kim Il-sung, who went on to visit it 20 times as Supreme Leader.Son Kim Jong-Il made 31 visits, while current leader Kim Jong-Un has made six appearances."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000323202590.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tony blair new centrist party impossible","story":"The ex-PM - seen as a potential leader of a new anti-Brexit movement - said it would probably be “impossible” for a third party to rise to power.And he called on mainstream Tory and Labour politicians to rise up and overthrow their leaders instead of breaking away.Writing in The Times, Mr Blair savaged both major parties and said they were letting the country down.He accused the Tories making unrealistic promises about Brexit - claiming a second EU referendum could be the only way to resolve the current isions.And he attacked Jeremy Corbyn, claiming the Labour boss has laid out a “welcome mat” for anti-Western communists who would previously have been shut out of the party.Mr Blair added: “In have poured these outcasts from the political wilderness, suddenly in charge of a potential party of government.“With them has come their sectarian, shouty, finger jabbing, with a whole sub-culture of conspiracy theories - the left equivalent of the alt-right.”But he insisted the way out of the impasse isn’t for politicians to set up a new party, because our electoral system is so dominated by the big two parties.He said: “I am not advocating a new party, organising one, or wanting to vote for one. In the British system such an endeavour may be impossible.“But the serious figures in both main parties need to demand of their leadership: enough, change course, you do not have indefinite licence to go further towards the extremes or unlimited time to  to reason.”A number of Labour MPs have discussed leaving the party and setting up a new vehicle to oppose Brexit and promote centre-left ideas.But every new party which has launched over the past two years has been a flop."},{"url":null,"title":"bonking boris is all mouth and no trousers lib dems say in dig at brexiteers love life","story":"MP Tom Brake used his party conference speech to mock the former Foreign Secretary over his reputation for sleeping around.The jibe came as he called for Brexit to be overturned and claimed staying in the EU would SAVE Britain £3billion.Speaking in Brighton Mr Brake, the party’s Brexit spokesman, said Mr Johnson is “a man of many words, but no Brexit plan.

As you ‘Mack down’ on your birthday cake, think about the birthday wishes you never extended to your FATHER-IN-LAW.”Mum-of-three Samantha Markle, also known as Samantha Grant, is a former actress and model, who lives in Florida, US.The Duchess of Sussex has endured a stream of criticism from her since tying the knot with Harry.The 37-year-old royals family has been in the spotlight after dad Thomas Markle pulled out of her wedding to Harry after it was revealed he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Thomas, 73, who lives in Mexico, has accused the royals of freezing him out of his daughter’s le over the pictures.A common theme of Samantha’s frequent Twitter rants are accusations that Harry and Meghan lack compassion for Thomas.They have unlimited resources and no interest or compassion to care. The truth sucks, she tweeted last month.Samantha Markle has previously urged her sister to contact their father, saying the Duchess would be responsible  their father died.She recently labelled Meghan a DuchASS and accused her of fake waves and smiles.I am not candy coating anything anymore! The DUCHASS should be humane to our father who has given her everything,.. and this media crap can stop!” she tweeted.He was the one who was always there for her. Fake waves and smiles can stop.

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Archbishop of Canterbury \u0026shyreceived a standing ovation at the event in Manchester for a major speech in which he blasted “vast companies like Amazon” who he said “can get away with paying almost nothing in tax”. And he was praised for saying zero-hours contracts were the “reincarnation of an ancient evil”. Less than 24 hours later it started to unravel when it emerged the Church of England invests heavily in – Amazon. Church staff also came forward to say that people who worked for it were \u0026shyemployed on zero-hour contracts. So far, so terrible. Whoever briefed the archbishop, pictured below, or helped prepare his speech could well be looking for a new contract of their own.  The hypocrisy is undeniable. You can’t lay into a company for having an ethically dubious stance on paying taxes while benefiting from heavy investments in that company.  And you can’t call for the end of zero-hour contracts when your organisation  employs people on those contracts.  Many of Archbishop Welby’s critics were Conservatives who felt his views were too similar to Labour policy – and they seized the opportunity to have a go at him. But it wasn’t just Tories who piled in. People questioned why the Church was sitting on a share portfolio worth \u0026pound25billion while parishioners were fundraising to repair churches and \u0026shycongregations were digging deep to put money into the Sunday collection plates. Now this has all come to light, you would expect the Church of England to disinvest from the tech giant it has \u0026shyaccused of not paying “a real living wage” and “leeching off the taxpayer”.

Obsessed Anthony Mantova was so twisted he even wore a T-shirt with a picture of the face of his victim – Chloe Hopkins. After years of fear and misery Chloe, 26, suffers from post-traumatic stress. Now she is backing the Sunday People’s campaign for a national register for persistent stalkers. Mantova, 41, has been jailed three times for breaching \u0026shyrestraining orders. Chloe said: “Prison didn’t stop him. After being jailed twice he was walking around wearing a T-shirt with my face on, telling people I am a horrible bitch. I sobbed, sick to my core. “Wherever I turned he seemed to be there. I was gripped with fear. I felt so alone.”  Chloe’s hell began in 2010 after she won a beauty contest to become Miss Prestatyn – her home town in Denbighshire – and was asked to switch on the Christmas lights there. Her career as a singer was \u0026shytaking off and she signed a record deal with Universal. One evening she introduced herself to a man alone in a pub and wished him a Merry Christmas. It was the worst thing she could have done. Mantova sent her a Facebook request, followed by a message saying her tiara and sash “would look good on his \u0026shybedroom floor”. He turned up at her public engagements and rang her to “breathe heavily” on the phone. In early 2011 he flashed his chest to her in a pub revealing a \u0026shytattoo of her name.  She said: “It \u0026shyreally disturbed me. I told him it had to stop. He stormed off.” Multiple \u0026shysclerosis sufferer Mantova started a Facebook \u0026shypetition calling for Chloe to lose her title, \u0026shyaccusing her of \u0026shybeing \u0026shyprejudiced against disabled people. Chloe told her parents she was \u0026shybeing stalked. A \u0026shypolice \u0026shyharassment warning was served on Mantova but he carried on sending messages and loitering outside her home. In July 2012 Prestatyn \u0026shymagistrates found him guilty of harassment. He was jailed for 18 weeks and given an \u0026shyindefinite restraining order against Chloe. She began treatment for PTSD after suffering anxiety attacks and \u0026shydeveloping bulimia. By that November she had lost 3\u0026frac12 stone and had to put her music career on hold. Mantova breached his \u0026shyorder shortly after being released, by \u0026shyfollowing Chloe and \u0026shyharassing her online. He was jailed for another 28 days. She moved to London but Mantova persisted and she \u0026shyreported him for wearing the shirt and abusing her online. Chloe said: “It felt never ending.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit skewered through leg sun","story":"NewsBrit skewered through leg by sun umbrella after fourth-floor balcony plunge in IbizaWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: The man fell off a balcony and crashed on to a table on a first floor terrace below before his leg was skewered by a sun umbrellaShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRita Sobot16:16, 15 SEP 2018Updated22:40, 15 SEP 2018NewsIt happened at about 10am this morning in the popular party resort of Sant Antoni, Ibiza \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 31-year-old British man has been skewered in the leg by a sun umbrella after plunging from the fourth floor of apartments in Ibiza .

Charles McCadden bought the upper-floor flat of a two-storey Victorian terrace on Burrows Road, Kensal Green, Brent, in 2016 using inheritance money. He purchased the flat on a leasehold basis and soon had the place redecorated, installing a new kitchen, bathroom, and central heating system. However, his property has been seized by the freeholder, Dr Afshan Malik - who lives downstairs - because he didn\u0027t get her permission before he started redecorating. Seeking her permission before carrying out improvement works were part of his lease.   Mr McCadden says he has been destitute and suicidal over the dispute, reports The Times .  Campaigners have said the case is one of most extreme they have seen and say it serves as a warning to leaseholders. The case has also sparked calls for a reform to a current law which allows freeholders to seize a property  there is a breach in the lease. Mr McCadden and Dr Malik\u0027s relationship broke down over a disagreement about maintenance costs and he took the case to a property tribunal. The court ruled last November: These are serious breaches and the next step will be for the applicant to apply to the county court to forfeit the lease.  MrMcCadden was ordered to pay \u0026pound216.62 in outstanding service charges and reimburse her the \u0026pound300 tribunal administration fee. He then refused to reverse the works or pay the fees to Dr Malik and she took him Willesden County Court who issued a forfeiture order and then a possession order, which transferred the lease to her name. Mr McCadden, who has a chronic medical condition, is now left with nothing. He claims he was not aware of the tribunal hearing because he was living in Scotland at the time, looking after his father who was seriously ill.  Further to this, he says he was unable to defend the forfeiture and possession orders after being let down by lawyers. He also said the works were minimal and disputed the service charges. Sebastian O’Kelly, of the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership , said: “Mr McCadden has been found to be an inconsiderate neighbour and a leaseholder with no understanding of his obligations. The sensible course would have been to reverse the works or settle up with Dr Malik for having carried them out wrongfully. “But the loss of a \u0026pound600,000 asset is out of proportion to the dispute . . . The key question is: what  it had been the other way around and the freeholder had been inconsiderate?  “This ruling will be hugely comforting for the commercial interests in residential leasehold. They know that their multibillion-pound speculations in ordinary people’s homes all have the nuclear option of forfeiture to enforce them.” Mr McCadden said: “The whole episode has made me feeling very anxious, stressed out and at times suicidal. I am living a nightmare. It does not feel real. I can’t believe what has happened.” Currently, about 40 per cent of new properties are sold as leasehold, meaning the homeowner owns the property but not the land it is built on. A lease is a contract and  a leaseholder breaches the terms, the landlord could take legal action against them. In order to gain possession of the property by forfeiting the lease it is necessary to obtain a court order. A freeholder must give the leaseholder valid notice of the breach under section 146 of the law. The leaseholder must agree that breach has occurred or it will be taken to the first-tier property tribunal or a court which will determine the amounts due. A section 146 cannot be served for debts under \u0026pound350 or less than three years. A leaseholder can apply to court to seek relief from forfeiture.  This means having the forfeiture set aside and the lease restored.

Chilling footage shows 12-year-old Scarlett O\u0027Hare joking these might be our final words, love yas after boarding The Crazy Train.  But her mum Katie feared her little girl could have died in the incident today, the Liverpool Echo reports.  The video shows the ride beginning to head up the track and Scarlett says I\u0027m scared before turning around with a terried face. Suddenly as the ride starts down its first drop the video shudders as the cart tilts - before dramatically cutting out.  A crash is heard just as the video cuts and the phone is dropped to the floor. Scarlett was left suspended in the air for more than 90 minutes and her mum said this was because a wheel on her carriage came off. Katie said her daughter had to jump into a firefighter\u0027s arms after she was left clinging to her cart by a harness.  The family, from Wavertree, spoke to the Liverpool Echo while on their way to Alder Hey Hospital, claiming Scarlett was suffering pain in her back and head following the ordeal.   Scarlett\u0027s tearful mum Katie told the said: Scarlett has been left completely traumatised by the incident. I wasn\u0027t there but my cousin and her little boy were and when I got the phone call my heart was in my mouth. You hear about children getting involved in accidents in fairgrounds and today it could of been my child - she could of died. Scarlett told her mum the train jolted and she slammed into the lap bar and whacked her head. Katie said: She blames herself for going on it and putting me through this stress. I lost a child 15 years ago to a head injury and when I got the phone call I thought it was going to happen all over again. It was absolutely heartbreaking. I\u0027m just so glad she got off the ride and hopefully she will be fine once Alder Hey have checked her over. When I saw the video I burst into tears - those could have been the last words she said to me.

Jobless Gavin Innes and 46-year-old Gillian each had a pot of tea as they chatted, laughed and compared pictures of their respective kids. The 45-year-old picked up the \u0026pound3.78 tab and insists he had no idea she was super rich... even though she picked him up at his two-bed council house in a Porsche. Gavin claims Gillian even pretended to be an office worker and only revealed her wealth on a second date weeks later, again over a cuppa. They had agreed to meet up after exchanging flirty chat via Facebook.  After hitting it off Gavin says they even talked about marriage just nine weeks into their six-month romance. But despite some good times it all ended in tears. And Gavin claims Gillian is lonely and that her Euromillions jackpot win has not bought her happiness. He says she seemed happier spending time scoffing cake at his humble home rather than going back to her mansion. Gavin also claims mum-of-two Gillian – who wed ex-prisoner Brian Deans, 37, last month – is just desperate to be loved. He says: “She was so lonely. You never meet a happy millionaire.  “She brought up marriage after about nine weeks and asked how I’d propose to her. I said I wanted to live together first.” The unlikely couple were thrown together after both signing up to a l reunion group on social media for people who attended Harris Academy in Dundee. Incredibly, Gavin says he did not realise she was the local lass who scooped the \u0026pound148million Lotto jackpot with her first husband Adrian. Gillian’s face has been plastered over the papers and on TV ever since the Euromillions win in 2012. But as their relationship developed father-of-two Gavin says he witnessed Gillian splashing the cash. He goes on: “She was throwing money at everybody. “But she preferred to stay at my house. There were a few times I saw the real Gillian.  “Once we got up at 3am and sat eating chocolate cake, before going for a drive along the coast in our pyjamas. “More of that would have been cool, just taking off. I could have fallen in love with that Gillian. “Another time, we sat under a railway bridge taking pictures of fire spinners. “She couldn’t believe how much fun she had, yet no one knew who she was. That was the best date we had.” Gavin recalls their first date, too, at the Kingsway Farm carvery just off the A90 in Dundee.  And he addresses sceptics who wonder how he never knew about Gillian’s Lotto luck. He says: “I don’t have a telly so I don’t watch the news. “I didn’t recognise Gillian when we first met and I don’t remember her from being at school as she was in the year above. “She said she worked in an office and moaned about how her boss was a pain in the a**e. “But she came to pick me up for our first date in a Porsche – it was strange to see a car like that coming up my street, which is kind of rough. “I thought it would be tacky to ask why she had a Porsche. “I thought whatever she did, she must be good at it. I was just happy to be in a Porsche.  “But even after she told me, I still paid for things. I’m old fashioned, I guess. “She wasn’t my usual type, physically, but I was attracted to her because she was charismatic and funny. We didn’t talk about money. “We mainly talked about our kids. We had a cup of tea, which I paid for.” Gavin says he and Gillian had begun a private conversation on Facebook after she expressed interest in a charity he wanted to launch to aid male victims of domestic abuse. She used her real name but Gavin insists he still didn’t click that she was a lottery winner. He says: “I was lonely, too. I just wanted some female company.” Gavin tells how Gillian revealed her fortune over another cuppa three weeks after the first date. He says she whipped out her mobile phone to show him the famous shot of her and Adrian, 47, holding champagne flutes and their whopping \u0026pound148million cheque. Gavin says he thought the picture was a fake – because he had mocked up a photo where he was holding a winner’s cheque. He recalls: “She told me she had something to tell me and showed me the picture of her and Adrian. I asked  she’d Photoshopped it. “I’d Photoshopped a similar one of me ‘winning’ the lottery. “She kind of looked offended and said, ‘No, I won it’. “My first question was: ‘How do you trust anyone?’ She said: ‘You just have to be careful’. “I assumed that’s the reason why she didn’t tell me at first.” As the romance developed, Gavin says that Gillian tried to help him get off unemployment benefit. He explains: “She hated me being on benefits so she told me to come off them. “I was nervous because I’d relied on them for years. “I was offered two or three jobs, but she told me to turn them down.”  Gavin claims he tried to play peacemaker between Gillian and her estranged family – dad Ian McCulloch, 71, mum Brenda, 68, and brother Colin, 43. They were living in a caravan park when Gillian hit the jackpot. At the time Ian said of his daughter: “Money won’t change Gillian. She’s just a lovely girl, a gem.” But the family later claimed Gillian turned her back on them. In response, Gillian has said: “It’s upsetting and raw. The money was supposed to make everybody happy. “But it’s made them demanding and greedy. “They’ve been given money and houses and cars but still wanted more.” Gavin says he only found out his relationship with Gillian was over Gavin when a reporter came to his door.  He believes one of the reasons the romance turned sour was because he tried to get her to heal her family rt. Gavin says: “She never talked about her parents, she avoided any conversation about them. “I just didn’t get it, I offered to come with her to mediate – but she didn’t want any help.” Gavin has faced accusations of being a gold digger. He insists he puts “morals over money” and was not with Gillian for her fortune. Gillian’s chaotic love le has never been far from the headlines since winning the Euromillions pot. On the day she and Adrian picked up their cheque they posed for pictures and were clearly over the moon. But they split up just 15 months after the jackpot win, publicly blaming the stress of the windfall for their orce.

Mark Woollen was subjected to a horric ordeal during which Grant Embleton held an insulin pen to his neck after Mark asked him for \u0026pound15 he owed him.  The 45-year-old victim now says he is living in fear after his neighbour turned on him, Chronicle Live reports.   The 27-year-old thug, from Wallsend, Newcastle, was jailed for 14 months after pleading guilty to the frightening assault.  But Mark says he has been forced to move out the area he has called home all his le fearing Embleton will come after him once he is released. And today as he relived his ordeal to Chronicle Live, the victim told how he believed the attacker would carry out his threats.  He said: As he was making that threat he was trying to pull my zip down. I really thought he was going to do it. He was always up and down as far as moods were concerned, but I never once in my le suspected he would do that to me. Mark met Embleton through his dad who lived opposite him near North Shields. He took his neighbour’s son under his wing and helped him out whenever he needed anything, he said. We got on well, said Mark. He would come across from time to time  he wanted to borrow anything. Shortly before the attack Embleton confided in Mark that he had been going through a hard time. He said he was suffering from mental health problems and that his mobile phone had been stolen while he was on the . Taking pity on his friend, Mark offered to sell him his old phone for \u0026pound15.  I felt a bit sorry for him, Mark explained. However, after more than a week Embleton had still not paid up. On the night on the attack, in March, Embleton turned up drunk at Mark’s house and said his dad had thrown him out. As the two friends chatted, Mark mentioned the phone, and this caused Embleton to flip. I was perfectly calm, but he just lost it, said Mark. He was completely dferent to how I had ever seen him before. That’s when I started to get scared and that’s when he launched into the attack.  Embleton punched Mark in the face several times before grabbing a set of pliers that Mark used to make models. He said he would cut off my you know what, said Mark. But because I wouldn’t let him get my zip he started to cut my ear. I was absolutely terried. Embleton also held an insulin pen to Mark’s neck during the terrying ordeal. I was in a lot of pain, said Mark. My ear was pouring with blood. I kept saying ‘Grant, just calm yourself down’. But he was just having none of it. I just wanted to calm him down and get out of the situation. Embleton eventually left Mark’s home saying he was going to get the last  home and taking his victim’s phone with him. Terried Mark ran out the house. Not wanting to wake his neighbours Mark attempted to run to the nearest payphone, but he got stuck on a fence on the way. I ran out the back door and climbed over the fence and ran across the school field, he said. But as I tried to get over a second fence, that’s where I got myself stuck. Mark attempted to flag down passing motorists. Eventually a woman stopped and called the police for him. The following day Embleton ed to Mark’s home to say ‘sorry’.

Mr Macintyre claims the cash was for spreading Soviet propaganda. British spymasters at MI6 were told in 1982 by Soviet double agent Oleg Gordievsky that the KGB were so interested in Mr Foot they had opened a file on him and codenamed him Agent Boot.  Gordievsky claimed the Labour leader never passed secrets about Britain but acted unwittingly as an agent of influence for Moscow.

Muscly Jack Moore, 21, was dozing in a park with girlfriend Vicky Clarke when the tyres of the two-ton vehicle rolled across them. Jack suffered horrendous internal injuries including broken ribs, a collapsed lung and liver damage. But medics said the keep-fit fan – who turned to exercise and diet at 17 after hitting an obese 16st – could have been killed had it not been for his ripped washboard stomach.  Jack, whose six-pack was cut away to be replaced with an 8in scar and tyre tread mark, said: The doctors said I was lucky I had more muscle otherwise I would probably have suffered more injuries. “They said I was very healthy and that was also a big factor in my recovery.” Jack and Vicky, 19, had just cuddled down on the grass beside a river in Earlham Park, Norwich, and shut their eyes when horror struck in June 2017. The Toyota Hilux, which was going round emptying litter bins, went over both of them as onlookers screamed.  Jack recalled: I opened my eyes and the truck was about a foot away from my head. I had no time to react and I just had to watch it happen. The front wheel crunched over my stomach which was really mentally distressing. It was the last thing I expected to happen and I think adrenaline kicked in so I did not feel the pain immediately. Then it drove over Vicky, stopped on her and started to reverse. I pulled myself back out from underneath it before it could run over me again. Then my stomach felt extremely painful and I knew something was seriously wrong with my body. I pulled up my t-shirt to look at it and it was really deformed and disfugured. My belly button was not in the centre anymore, it had been pushed off to the left. The thread details of the tyre were etched into my skin and the right side of my stomach was very red. Then the pain really kicked in. I tried to scream but my lung was punctured so I couldn\u0027t really do it. A little girl was the first person who rushed over to me, bless her heart, followed by her dad. Then about 10 people were around me, telling me to breathe and stay conscious. They were asking me what my name was and what day it was.  It was dficult to speak and I just wanted to curl up in a ball alone with the pain but the people around me would not let me move. I\u0027m lucky they were there because I probably would have lost even more blood internally  I had moved. Someone had called an ambulance and although it felt like an eternity waiting on the grass, it was actually really quick, we were lucky that the hospital was just one quarter of a mile away. The truck had punctured my lung, tore my kidney in two places, tore my liver, broke two ribs and I lost one litre of blood through internal bleeding. I lost so much blood that I started slipping in and out of consiousness. I remember the police arriving and a police woman standing over me, blocking the sun from my eyes. And I vaguely remember the ambulance arriving and the paramedics giving me an epidural and gas in the park before I passed out. Jack was rushed to hospital for emergency le-saving treatment. Jack said: My next clear memory is waking up in a hospital bed. My stomach was extremely painful. I pulled back the covers and saw a huge scar running from under my nipple to my groin.  I had tubes all over me with about six cannulas in just one hand. I had a big needle in my spine for the epidural and I had another tube coming out of my arm. I panicked. I did not know what happened. Was my partner ok? My mum was by my bed and she told me Vicky had been hit but she was alive. I think I was pretty out of it with all the painkillers but then it all started flooding back to me like a dream after you\u0027ve just woken up.  Jack, who is being represented by personal injury specialist Slater and Gordon in a civil case, recovered after a hospital stay but was left with problems including not being able to use the loo properly. He was also diagnosed with PTSD. He said: I still have abdominal pain and I was diagnosed with PTSD. Recovering psychologically has been more dficult than the physical aspects. I still get flashbacks of the moment I saw the wheel on my right side and watched as it drove over me. It was really traumatic. The park was a place where I always felt safe before. I\u0027ve gone there for years walking my dog and there are always families and children there. It’s really knocked my confidence but I\u0027m determined to get better again. I feel lucky to be alive and I hope that I can heal.” Vicky suffered broken vertebrae, a broken collarbone and a fractured sternum in the horror crush. She was admitted to hospital for treatment alongside Jack but she has since also been released. Samantha Williams, a personal injury specialist at Slater and Gordon law firm who is representing Mr Moore in a civil case, said the accident will have a long lasting effect on her client. She said: “Mr Moore has gone from being a fit and healthy young man with his le ahead of him to somebody who struggles to do the most basic activities without being in pain.

A study of our belief in the supernatural has found two thirds of us believe in magic, while up to 29 per cent think that vampires are real. And 45 per cent said it’s highly likely the bloodsuckers are secretly living among us along with witches and demons.  Research commissioned by Sky One to launch new drama, A Discovery of Witches, found nearly half of us are convinced we’ve met someone with magical powers. Its poll found 20 per cent of workers thought a colleague had put a spell on them – while 13 per cent quizzed admitted they had tried to “curse” an office rival. But it’s not all bad PR for vampires – around 37 per cent said they were a turn-on too because they always look ageless, while 33 per cent believed it was their super human strength and speed that made them so alluring.

Brandon Bromby was in hospital for six weeks after the accident on Christmas Eve - which happened in a split second.   The then three-year-old has been scarred for le with 24 percent of his body burned, Hull Live reports.  Brandon entered the bathroom and moments later fell into the bath fully clothed in the 2014 accident. His sister, then 12, managed to pull him out quickly but the damage had already been done.  Mum Sam, of east Hull, still gets emotional as she recounts what happened. “He fell in and I immediately took off his clothes,” she said. “Brandon didn’t scream at all because he was in shock. “When I took his clothes off it was just horrible. The skin was falling off his hand. “We called an ambulance and he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary but, almost immediately, he was transferred to Pinderfields.” Sam remembers some parts of the accident vividly but says some of it is a blur. “I remember exactly when it happened,” she said, “but I was in complete shock. It was very scary and we were at Pinderfields before we knew it. “I didn’t realise hot water could do as much damage as any fire.”  It was a dficult juggling act for Sam and husband, Steve. “We have four other children who were all impacted,” Sam said. “We couldn’t spend time together as a family. “My oldest daughter was living with her boyfriend and took the other children in while we were in Pinderfields. They didn’t have much of a Christmas. “The hospital was fantastic and let me get a taxi about a week after it happened so I could spend some time at Christmas with my other children.” Brandon remained in hospital for six weeks but even when he was released there was still a long road of recovery ahead. “He had ious operations and needed skin grafts,” Sam said. “Even after he left hospital he needed cream putting on every day, wore pressure garments and had splinters on his hands. “It also affected both his feet so he couldn’t walk for a long time so he had to learn to do it again with lots of physiotherapy. “The skin will stretch as he gets older so Brandon is probably going to need another skin graft when he is older. “He will be scarred for le and the burns covered 24 per cent of his body.”  What helped Brandon and countless other children was Pinderfields Burns Club which was established to help children face the challenges of suffering a burn injury. The club, headed by Tracy Foster, ensures youngsters face treatment in an atmosphere of fun, support and rehabilitation resulting in an improvement in care and experience. It was developed in response to the needs of burn-injured children who lacked appropriate psychological support. “The burns club has been fantastic,” Sam said, “and Tracy has helped us so much. “Brandon is doing brilliantly now but when people ask him what happened he doesn’t know what to say and he gets self-conscious. “But he has been to places like Sherwood Forest and even Tenere with the burns club and it has helped him psychologically to be with other kids who have been through something similar. They even compare scars and injuries. “The club helps children rebuild their lives and those of their families. “Brandon is strong and a fighter and is not ashamed of his scars. “I am also relieved he is not scared of water and even takes baths.

However, passengers using British airports already face some of the highest tax rates in the world in air passengers duties. A Department for Transport report in April is said to have cited a Which? study highlighting low levels of passenger satisfaction. Grant Shapps, Tory MP and chairman of the cross-party Big Infrastructure Group, hit out at the proposals saying: “It would beggar belief  passengers already hit with one of the highest rates of tax in the world have a new tax slapped on them just for using airports.  “The Government needs to think twice before creating new taxes which make it more expensive for families to go on holiday.” It comes after the Border Force budget was cut by eight per cent between 2012/13 and 2016/17. The number of full-time officers also fell by 10 per cent in two years up to 2016/17.

But with royal protocol to remember and the sheer intensity of the situation, it\u0027s a totally natural response.  Just ask Prince Harry .   The Duke of Sussex has recently opened up about what it\u0027s really like to bump into his grandmother in the halls of Buckingham Palace .  And his hilarious answer on the subject has surprised some people - because it\u0027s totally relatable.   In a new documentary called Queen of the World, Harry is shown addressing a group of hospitality professionals from the Caribbean who are staying at the palace, reports The Express .  The 34-year-old prince offered the group some advice and went on to reveal that even he still panics when he sees the Queen, despite being related to her. He said: You guys have spent way more time in Buckingham Palace than I ever have - and you’ve only been here two weeks. Have you bumped into the Queen yet?  If you suddenly bump into her in the corridor, don’t panic. I know you will. We all do! This isn\u0027t the first time Prince Harry has made a comment like this. During the BBC\u0027s Elizabeth At 90 tribute documentary, which aired in 2016, he confessed that he views the Queen as his boss.  He added: I still view her more as the Queen than my grandmother. The new documentary, Queen of the World, will be shown in two-parts and provides a special look at the Queen\u0027s role as head of the Commonwealth. Claudine Jeffrey from Antigua, who was part of the group Harry spoke to, described the Royal household as a fun place to work.

The revelation comes days after the identities of the men suspected of the failed hit were given as Ruslan Borishov and Alexander Petrov – though they are believed to be assumed names. The Sunday Mirror can reveal authorities are keeping a close hold on details of the other two suspects.

The source said Petrov and Borishov – who claim to be tourists – could have met up with the other two suspects after checking into the City Stay Hotel on Bow Road in East London.  They later caught trains from Waterloo to Salisbury, where the deadly Novichok was daubed on the door of the house where Skripal and daughter Yulia lived.  The source said: “It’s believed they could have met a handler who was working at the embassy and a fourth, the medic, might have had oversight of the whole thing to make sure they didn’t risk ruining the operation by getting themselves contaminated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"seven online friends cystic fibrosis","story":"NewsSeven online friends with cystic fibrosis finally meet in real le after le-saving lung transplantsEXCLUSIVE: Pals met each other online and went through their health struggles together after they were all born with the condition that meant they eventually needed new organsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByErin Cardf22:09, 15 SEP 2018NewsSeven women who have battled cystic fibrosis and supported each other met up to celebrate their bravery for the first time \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis could be seven ordinary women enjoying an afternoon of prosecco. But the photo is a true picture of courage – as they became friends while waiting for lesaving lung transplants. All born with cystic fibrosis, George Compton, 28, Ashley Harris Moore, 36, Libby Clare, 22, Holly van Geffen, 26, Sharon Brennan, 37, Charlotte Davies, 24 and Josie Stewart, 25, have had their lives saved by the kindness of anonymous donors. Diagnosed with the genetic condition as youngsters, they \u0026shyhad a few years of good health before declining to the point where they needed new organs.  Holly, whose deterioration started aged 18 when a lung \u0026shycollapsed, said: “You try to battle on as best you can and not let your condition hold you back. “But there does come a point when you see all your peers growing up, becoming more\u0026shy \u0026shyindependent and doing all these adult things while you feel as  you’re regressing.” Although all had the support of family and friends, they found it was a great help to speak to somebody else who was weathering the \u0026shyemotional storm of waiting for a transplant. Over time, they found each other through a Facebook support page, eventually setting up a WhatsApp group called Transplant Girls. Josie said: “We built up such a special bond.” But, due to strict cross-infection rules, cystic fibrosis patients are normally told not to meet in person until after their operation. So for years their friendship existed only in the digital world, where they spoke every week. At least 10,400 people in the UK have the disease, which causes the lungs to become clogged with sticky mucus, making it dficult to breathe and leaving sufferers far more vulnerable to le-threatening infections.  One by one, the group began receiving \u0026shytransplants, with Charlotte having the first in October 2011, and Josie the last in July 2016. Those who had operations offered reassurance to those still waiting, and they all checked in with each other regularly – determined to keep their spirits up and their bond strong. Then, having all recovered from their transplants and adjusted to their new normal, the group were finally able to meet in person for the first time in July 2018, toasting their health – and friendship – together over a bottle of fizz in London’s Chinatown. George said: “We chose London as that’s the easiest place for everyone to get to. A couple of us have met one-on-one over the years but we’ve never all been together as a group before. “It was so amazing to see them all there in person and to laugh, drink and \u0026shycelebrate le together.”  Now the group are all supporting the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror’s Change the Law for Le campaign. They are calling on people not only to sign up as donors but also to share those wishes with their loved ones. Libby said: “I want to ask people,  your mum, dad, daughter, brother, friend or even you were ill, would you take a donor organ? “If the answer is yes then you need to think about giving one too.”  George Compton, 28 George was diagnosed at 18 months and spent most of her childhood in hospital. Even holding a conversation was a challenge as hospital administrator George, whose carpenter husband Lee, 32, has been her rock – would be too breathless to get words out. Then, at 21, her right lung collapsed and she was put on the transplant list. But, doing well on drug Kalydeco, she removed herself against advice.  In September 2014 her lungs began to give up again. Put on the transplant list, she got new lungs 11 months later. Her le changed instantly, as she was able to do all the little things that had once felt impossible, like blowing out birthday candles. The next year, she met her donor’s family after letters and they remain close. George, from Cobham, Surrey, said: “I’ve lived not able to breathe properly. After the op I could whistle and blow-up balloons – stupid little things that meant a lot to me.” Ashley Harris Moore, 36 Ashley was born before the heel prick test so was not diagnosed until she was two. The condition did not hold back active Ashley until, aged 14, a severe infection put her on intravenous antibiotics. She went to university but in 2015 declined dramatically. Desperate loved ones, including her computer scientist husband Alastair, 38, launched Ashley’s Next Breath, to encourage people to sign up as donors.  Ashley said: “The physical suffering was horrendous but I wouldn’t wish the emotional toll on anyone. Worrying what would happen to Emerson   I didn’t make it was torture. “Even now, I’ll catch him getting ready for school and feel so grateful.” Ashley was on a machine to buy time when, thankfully, a donor was found.  In 2015, she had a new pair of lungs and is indebted to her donor and their family for the chance to see Emerson, now four, grow up. Ashley, of South London, said: “Their selflessness has transformed my le beyond my wildest dreams.” Libby Clare, 22 Diagnosed at two, psychology intern Libby could manage her condition relatively well. But at nine, problems began when she got an infection that slowly ate away at her lungs. Her lung  declined and at 16 she found herself in hospital more and more. But Libby pushed on, leaving her Cambridge home for the University of Southampton in 2014 and going Interrailing after getting approval from doctors.  But a week into the trip she collapsed. A CT scan found she had very severe pneumonia. As it developed into chest sepsis, she was in and out of hospital for eight months. Her medical team got her on a trial of Orkambi – a drug campaigners want made available on the NHS.  It let Libby grow strong enough to be considered for a transplant and she had the 14-hour op in May 2016. She said: “If this buys me one more year, it’s still longer than I would’ve had. The best way I can honour my donor now is live my le to the full.” Josie Stewart, 25 After chest infections and a struggle to gain weight, Josie was diagnosed aged two. Initially doctors thought she was just behind in hitting milestones because she had been born prematurely with her twin Tommy, who does not have cystic fibrosis. At three she began receiving intravenous antibiotics and was tube-fed. “Childhood involved chest physio and nebulisers, even when I was well,” she said. Aged 22 and a fashion student, Josie started to decline – which she knew could happen but never thought it would be so rapid.  Before she knew it, she was on oxygen 24/7, clinging to le. In March 2016, Josie was listed for a transplant and put on an ECMO machine, where blood is removed and then pumped back into the body so it bypasses the heart and lungs, allowing them to rest. Then in July that year Josie, from South East London, got the call for a lung transplant. “I know false alarms happen so I’d resigned myself to the fact it may not go ahead,” she said. “Then, suddenly, doctors were in my room, telling me we were good to go.  “I’d been having panic attacks but being wheeled to theatre, I felt remarkably calm.” Medics later found a bleed on her lung they wanted to monitor so Josie was kept asleep for a few days after surgery. On coming to, doctors switched off her oxygen to see how she’d react. She thought she was still hooked up to the machine until they told her: “It’s you. You’re breathing.” Josie said: “It was really emotional.”  Charlotte Davies, 24 Charlotte’s weight fell as a newborn and she failed to thrive. A sweat test at three weeks revealed she had cystic fibrosis. From two, she had three-monthly intravenous antibiotics at and she was tube-fed from three. She said: “I tried my best to get on with things. My family were always careful to teach me that my health shouldn’t hold me back.” At 13, Charlotte, now a TV production assistant, began to lose weight and her lung  declined. By 16, it was just 26 per cent.  After spending the last five weeks of her GCSEs in hospital, a transplant was mentioned in February 2010 but she did not feel ready. Her lung collapsed two months later. By September she was on oxygen 24/7. She went on the waiting list and got the call ten months later. Doctors showed Charlotte, of Dover, Kent, her new lungs on a screen.  She said: “My old ones had been blackened, these were pink and healthy. I remember the first proper breath I took. “I’d never known what it was like to take a properly deep breath before.” Sharon Brennan, 37 Born with cystic fibrosis, health journalist Sharon suffered with persistent infections. Eventually they caused irreparable damage to her lungs, leaving her in need of a le-saving transplant. And five years ago, in August 2013, she received her new organs.  Speaking of the friendship she has forged with the other women, Sharon, from South London, said: “It was incredible to meet my tribe – we are all at dferent stages of le but all determined to make the most of our second chance. “And it’s nice to be reassured on the tough days that they are all there to talk to, whenever needed.” Holly van Geffen, 26 Holly was diagnosed at six weeks. With physio and support from loved ones she felt relatively well until 14. Then an infection meant she needed intravenous antibiotics every three months. At 18 she suffered a collapsed lung.  Doctors raised the idea of a transplant but Holly, a print designer from Leicester, was afraid. Then, just before she was 21, a friend and fellow cystic fibrosis patient died. Holly said: “I wasn’t far off being as poorly as her so it really woke me up.” She went on the list at 22 and had the op in 2015.

Its bosses say 72,655 British women aged between 18 and 26 have signed up – and 24,218 older men. Stephany has been dating one in his mid-50s for nine months and he has helped pay her debts, taken her on holidays to the south of France and Italy and bought her Chanel handbags. “If I didn’t have the massive student loan hanging over my head I may not have joined the site,” she said. “But I am glad I did because I get help paying my bills but there are also the luxuries which make le nicer. “I think those people who criticise probably wish they had done it themselves, to be honest.”  Stephany is about to start her third year of a degree course in autism studies at Kent University in Canterbury. She lives with her mum in Bexleyheath, South East London, but expects to graduate with a \u0026pound50,000 student loan debt. Her sugar daddy is a senior executive in a company in Brussels and her mum has given the relationship her blessing, she said. Stephany added: “We both said at the outset what we wanted. It works very well because there is real affection on both sides.” RichMeetBeautul, which is based in Norway, sparked outrage when it launched in the UK with an aggressive advertising campaign last November. Giant billboards at colleges showed a couple cuddling with the words “romance, passion and no student loan, go out with a sugar daddy”. Its success comes as students borrow more than ever, with almost four in 10 thinking of quitting over cash worries. Stephany said: “People need money to get an education and have some kind of le when they are studying.

You\u0027ve had the initial adrenaline rush of discovering those winning numbers and you\u0027ve called Camelot to find out what happens next. But before you can get you hands on the winnings the ticket has to be veried to be genuine. In some cases this can just be a few days but over Christmas this can run to weeks - especially  work gets in the way. What do you do with that priceless ticket which is your gateway to a le of luxury? These are the nine strangest places winners have hidden their tickets before they can be veried. 1. Under clothes in the bedroom drawer  Rugby-mad couple Stephen and Keri Chick, from Pontypool in Wales, banked \u0026pound1m with their winning ticket in February 2015. Stephen checked his ticket in store and was told to contact Camelot. He said: The woman in the shop scanned my ticket and called her manager over. They made me sign it straight away, and said I needed to go home and call Camelot. When they confirmed that I\u0027d won \u0026pound1 million and a first class trip around the world, I started to cry, I was so overwhelmed. Stephen hid the winning ticket underneath a pile of clothes in his bedroom drawer, and that is where it stayed until the following Friday, when he was able to take the day off work to meet a Camelot Winners\u0027 Adviser - and the bank manager.

In a \u0027sacred\u0027 antique teapot on the kitchen unit  Grandparents Judy and Frank Whitmore won \u0026pound1m on the EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle Draw in December 2011. The married couple, from Tockwich in North Yorkshire, hid their winning ticket in a \u0027sacred\u0027 antique teapot over Christmas. Mrs Whitmore, who is teetotal, posed for photographs with her husband, the teapot and a glass of champagne for Mr Whitmore - though he usually prefers Tetleys bitter. She said: The teapot is a family heirloom. It was Frank\u0027s great-great-grandmother\u0027s. We kept it on top of the pine unit on a shelf. It\u0027s sacred to us, our little teapot.

His mother Maria Riselli , decided to store the ticket in a glass jar where she could see it was still safe every time she walked past it. Mr Riselli, 50, from Gloucester, scooped \u0026pound24,501,283 in the must-be-won Lotto after the jackpot rolled down to those who had matched five numbers and the bonus ball. He trusted to his mother when it came to the important task of looking after the ticket while he waited for Camelot’s offices to re-open after the Christmas break to confirm the scoop.

Hidden in living room cabinet - but they did not know they had won  A group of NHS hospital catering staff from Port Talbot won \u0026pound25m on the Euromillions in November last year. The syndicate all took early retirement - but they didn\u0027t know they had won when the draw was made. Ultra-organised syndicate leader Julie Saunders, 56, asked her husband to go and buy the ticket on Friday as they were all working. The day after the draw they were visiting her father in a residential home and he told her just one ticket had won the jackpot. She said ‘it could be us as we haven’t checked yet’ – little did she know the ticket hidden in the usual spot in her living room cabinet was the winner. Julie went home and checked the numbers and called Camelot straight away before letting the other members know of their amazing win.  Read the story here.  5. Hidden in we\u0027s underwear drawer  Melvynn Wright hid his winning ticket in his we\u0027s underwear drawer - and splashed out the cash on a new mobility scooter for her. Melvynn we Anne and their four daughters scooped a le-changing \u0026pound1 million after their numbers came up on their syndicate ticket. The 74-year-old revealed he was so scared he would misplace the ticket before Camelot veried the victory, that he stashed it away among Anne’s undergarments.  Retired transport manager Melvynn, from Madeley, told the Stoke Sentinel : “I checked the numbers and they just jumped out at me.  I went to my we and told her come down and check them again. “I always said I would win one day. I just had to keep the faith.  Read the story here.  6. Hidden in a lantern while they went on holiday  Alison and John Doherty won almost \u0026pound15m on the National Lottery in July 2016. The couple, from Elderslie in Renfrewshire, Scotland, discovered they had won but still headed off for a pre-booked family holiday to Florida the next day. They kept their winning ticket hidden in a lantern while they were abroad. She said: He  made me get on the phone to Camelot straight away. Waiting for the winner adviser to call me back was the longest hour of my le. When they did I was screaming again when the phone rang. She added: I put the original ticket inside a hurricane lantern candle holder I have in my bedroom. I also made a photocopy and hid that in the box that John keeps his work boots in, just in case. I wasn\u0027t taking any chances. 7. Hidden in car glove box for a month The winner of a €4.4 million lotto jackpot prize kept the precious ticket hidden in the glove compartment of their car for a MONTH. The delighted punter, from Donegal, who remained anonymous, finally collected a massive cheque at Lotto HQ in Dublin on Thursday. The golden ticket was purchased for the draw on Saturday, January 13. Speaking at Lotto HQ, the winner explained: “I keep all my Lotto tickets in the glove box. “Once I found out I won I stored the ticket in the glove box of the car during the day while I was at work. “But I took the ticket into the house at night time. That piece of paper has clocked up some mileage over the past month.” 8. In her handbag for a week  Donna Stickley walked around with a lottery ticket - worth \u0026pound21m - in her handbag for a week before she and her husband realised they had won the jackpot. After checking the ticket during a shopping trip in Slough a week after buying it Mrs Stickley discovered they had won some money when she was told to call Camelot as the shop couldn\u0027t pay out prizes over \u0026pound500.

The 82-year-old has \u0026shydedicated her le to abandoned pets – and has given up relationships, a modelling career and a home to build a sanctuary. Now in a book she has told the world about the animal that broke her heart – a mute pup who learned how to bark. She said: “I can’t help but have \u0026shyfavourites. I had a beautul dog called Gabby who died a few years ago. I lost three stone with stress and grief.” Gabby was mute when she came to the sanctuary following years of \u0026shybeing held indoors. But with Barby’s help and love, her confidence grew.  She said: “Gabby repaid my kindness a million times over.” Around 600 \u0026shyanimals live at her \u0026shysanctuary, including eight goats, 150 cats, 16 pigs and a peacock. She said: “Fostering animals is a privilege. My house is permanently filled with \u0026shyvolunteers, dogs and visitors. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Scouted as a model for Coca-Cola as a young woman, she gave up a \u0026shypromising career after \u0026shydeveloping a “soppy” love of \u0026shyanimals. She said: “In the early 70s a soldier stationed in Northern Ireland asked me to look after his female dog. “When he came home she was so attached to me, she never left. Then people kept asking me to help.”  Barby bought land and lived in a caravan so she could dedicate the rest of the space to \u0026shyanimals. The site, in Bexhill, East Sussex, grew from there and relies completely on donations. Even the man of her dreams did not stand a chance against her true love. She said: “My long-term partner said I had to choose between him and my animals. I packed his bag for him.

But Zasha Whiteway-Wilkinson, 24, left was stunned and felt like she was drowning when a doctor told her that she was seven months pregnant. She had put on about 1.5 stone  over six weeks, but put her weight gain down to her lestyle.  Zasha told Gloucestershire Live that she had been eating absolute garbage after moving home and she had joked to her dad feel my stomach, it\u0027s proper turning over the day she found out she would become a mum.   Within hours, however, Zasha, of Cheltenham, was told that her stomach troubles were actually a baby in her womb and she would give birth in two months.  Here, Zasha tells her story about her weight gain, the moment she found out she was pregnant and what le has been like after giving birth to a son, Isaac, and becoming a mother.     You hear about all the time about women who had no idea they were pregnant and always wonder How didn\u0027t they know?. I thought the same, until it happened to me. I once had a friend whose mum did not know she was pregnant until her labour day... with twins! It made national news , and the first thing anyone would ask is How didn\u0027t she know?. My story is not quite as dramatic, but for me finding out I was pregnant at seven months was dramatic enough to blow up my whole world.  I first discovered I was pregnant almost a month after my 21st birthday on July 7, 2015. I had recently accepted a job as an admin assistant at an engineering company in Hereford, where I lived at the time. I had also recently finished university, achieving an undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Gloucestershire, which I thought I would never be able to use when I found out. At around four or five months pregnant I crashed my car - came over a hill too quickly in the rain, spun out and drove straight into a 40mph sign. I spent the next couple of months repairing said car completely unaware of the possible stress I could be causing to the fetus taking shelter in my stomach.  Feel my stomach! It\u0027s proper turning over!   Being the responsible adult I aspired to be, excited about the opportunities I would gain now I had this fancy new office job - I booked myself an appointment at my local doctors\u0027 surgery to ensure I was healthy for my new grown up le. I remember every minute detail of that day like it was yesterday. I had been joking around with my dad that morning about having had stomach troubles, Dad, feel my stomach, it\u0027s proper turning over!, before heading over to Hereford County for my check up. Obviously the doctor asked all the usual questions, Could you pregnant?. I said: No way I\u0027ve not been with anyone in over four months. And I\u0027ve had the contraceptive injection since January anyway. I\u0027d put on about 1.5 stone in about six weeks, but had been eating absolute garbage since I\u0027d moved back home. She came back into the office with a very serious look and I thought Oh God, I\u0027ve got an STI, gross. My very own Gabriel, this blond, middle aged doctor delivering the news that would change everything, waved this blue test in my face and said It\u0027s positive. I\u0027m certain. It came up in seconds. Cue silence as I looked at her waiting for her to tell me I had some gross incurable disease.  What we need to talk about now, is whether you\u0027re going to go forward with it - or put a stop to it, she said. Go forward with it? What was she on about? Why would I go forward with some gross disease? Sorry? What\u0027s positive? Your pregnancy test. It came up instantly. I felt my breath quicken, as I felt my heart go into my throat, I felt like I was drowning. There was absolutely no way I could be pregnant, I\u0027d been careful, I was on contraception and I hadn\u0027t had a partner in months anyway. She asked  I was okay and to be honest, no I bloody well wasn\u0027t. I\u0027d just been offered a great new job - how could this be happening to me?! My hands trembling I said I was going to call my dad, he had barely picked up when bless his soul, his 21-year-old daughter began hyper-ventilating through muffled sobs as she broke the news that she\u0027d become just another statistic. Asking me  he should come home I breathed out a confirmation, my whole world was crumbling and I wanted my dad. What were my options?  A part of this story, , is that as I\u0027d been a student throughout most of my pregnancy I had hardly been looking after myself. I\u0027d been drinking , eating absolute garbage , and on a fairly low but not insignicant 10 a day smoking habit. Anyway, as much as I\u0027d like to pretend I\u0027m a model, respectable person - this sort of behaviour pattern doesn\u0027t stop overnight.  So the first thing I did after leaving that doctors office , was smoke a full pack of 20 and devour three bags of pork crackling. will have it known that after that pack of smokes I quit cold turkey for two years .   I met my dad in Costa coffee in The Old Market shopping centre in Hereford and sipped my way slowly through an orange slushy thing. Uncontrollably crying into my drink as we talked through my options. At the time I still thought abortion might be an option as I just about hit that three and a half month cut off, but the idea of doing that to something which as referenced in the cult classic film Juno, had fingernails, would bring another stream of tears rushing out.  Adoption was never really an option for me due to personal family circumstances - it just wasn\u0027t something I was comfortable with and my family made clear from the beginning that  I were to go down that route they would want to adopt the child themselves. I had absolutely zero desire to recreate an EastEnders plot line, so I plugged that train of thought immediately. This rationale left with me with only one option. I was going to have a baby. It was like a snowball effect, except the snowball was on fire  Fast forwarding, I\u0027d come to the assumption that I was three months pregnant, no more than four. So when I saw my GP that day he had a feel around my stomach and offered up his professional opinion as 15 weeks , which although terrying was not altogether unsurprising. It did eliminate any hopes I may have had of terminating the pregnancy however.  He told me that the next step was to arrange a \u0027dating scan\u0027, this and a blood test would also tell me whether the fetus had downs syndrome or spina bida - which I could not comprehend how this was now a worry for me when only that morning I\u0027d thought I might just have a simple case of norovirus .  There seemed to be no urgency from anyone to help me arrange this scan, I spent many hours on the phone and no-one seemed to care. I\u0027d literally just spent my 21st birthday at Harry Potter World! I didn\u0027t have any idea what I was doing! It was only when as a passing comment to a lovely lady on the NHS antenatal helpline, that this fetus was doing flips in my podgy stomach that they seemed to perk up a bit. They said that the baby would only be moving noticeably  I was 21+ weeks gestation. There goes another month and half. She booked me in for the following Monday, it was currently Friday.  Manic Monday   Monday came and I lay on the bed as the midwe slathered my chubby tummy in the blue goo. Looking at that scan made the whole surreal experience very, very real. There was my baby, my unwanted, unexpected, unbelievable little human baby. She said that I was too far gone to date accurately, but she put the date somewhere in the region of 27.5 weeks gestation. Just like that I\u0027d lost another month and a half - this was absolutely ridiculous, I felt that I might as well have just dropped then! This calculation meant that date of contraception was bang on January 12, 2015 , and it was anything else it was closer to Christmas, but I knew this was an impossibilty. What this means of course is that when I\u0027d been tested in January before I got on contraception, I\u0027d had a false negative pregnancy test and got straight onto the injection thinking I\u0027d be protected, when in reality I was already pregnant. This date was set though, this is what they were going to base their dates on for the future, they believed I\u0027d give birth on October 3, 2015. Due date  The run up to the due date was manic. In a perpetual state of panic I set about redecorating my childhood bedroom to cater for both me and my imminent little le. The closer I got to my due date, obviously the bigger I got. But to the untrained eye I just looked like a big girl, I was about 13.9 stone by nine months pregnant . It became an effort to climb up the stairs, but hiding my pregnancy was still easy, I began to wear pure stretchy fabrics leggings, bulky t-shirts, massive hoodies etc. I wasn\u0027t ashamed of my baby, but I didn\u0027t want anyone to say anything that would hurt me when I was already feeling so vulnerable. My due date came and went and I was booked in for an induction on October 15, 2015. I didn\u0027t know anything about induction but I did know I wanted to meet my baby. I never bothered finding out the sex, I didn\u0027t care and figured what was the point - I\u0027d find out in two months anyway! The induction process involved an on-call midwe inserting a pessary and gel into the vagina, they did this twice over six hour periods. Once they had done this they strapped me up to this heart rate monitor, .  I haven\u0027t heard many happy birth stories, so I don\u0027t like to say mine was bad or particularly dficult - How can you measure one person\u0027s pain on another? Shortly after the second pessary, I started bleeding and I started being sick. Sick enough that it completely made up for my total lack of morning sickness early on! I couldn\u0027t keep anything down, I had started the process at about 9pm on the 15th, and by the time my dad was allowed in to see me at 9am on the 16th, I can tell you that I had definitely felt better. Cold sweats, the shakes and the vomiting had me wanting to go to the Winchester and wait for all this to blow over. I had initially wanted a drug free birth but given that  I\u0027d had the energy to throw a chair at anyone who talked to me - I would have, so I accepted anything and everything they threw at me. When the time came to offer me an epidural  I happily said yes. Anything, anything to stop this pain. So they plugged me in to the epidural and inserted a catheter and within 10 minutes, the absolutely crippling contractions, combine with violent bouts of sickness and enough sweat to fill a bath - stopped.  I was no longer in labour, and my baby was in distress   This seemed like a great thing but skipping through the story a little bit, turns out I\u0027d had too much happy juice and I was no longer in labour, and my baby was in distress. My previous optimistic mood went through the floor as I quickly signed my section paperwork and was wheeled off to theatre. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped to something like 50 beats per minute  I remember correctly. The normal pulse is 120-160 beats per minute. When they wheeled me into theatre they told me that the strength of the epidural meant that they wouldn\u0027t bother with any more anaesthetic, but when it came to it I needed two spinal injections and then a general anaesthetic to finally knock me out. The whole saga had been dramatic enough, it seemed only fitting enough I needed enough drugs to knock out a horse before this rollercoaster could finally come to stop.  Is it alive?  When I woke up I was so thirsty, my first sentence was, Water. Is it alive? It seems crazy but given the circumstances I just didn\u0027t believe that the universe wanted me to have this baby. I didn\u0027t do pregnancy properly and I couldn\u0027t even do the birth properly, something women have been doing forever and I just kept messing it up. Obviously this is nonsense but there\u0027s no harsher critic for anyone than the voice inside their head. Anyway, my baby was alive, he was a little boy and he\u0027s called Isaac and he is absolutely perfect. Two months previously I hadn\u0027t even known about his existence and now I couldn\u0027t see an existence without him. The love for him wasn\u0027t instant, I knew I\u0027d die for him but I didn\u0027t love him immediately. I don\u0027t believe in love at first sight and I didn\u0027t feel that I\u0027d had enough time to get ready for him, let alone love him. It didn\u0027t take long, I think it was the first time I cried post birth - about 10 days? I realised it wasn\u0027t about growing to love my boy, my boy was love.

The victim was left with a string of injuries after her ordeal and is barely able to speak, according to her mother. It has emerged that the suspects knew the girl and her family and had been following her in the run up to an apparently well-planned attack. The identity of the one of the suspects, a soldier in the Indian army, has caused further outrage. If an army personnel is involved in the crime we will ensure that the person is caught and booked for rape. We do not shelter criminals, Lt Gen Cherish Mathson told NDTV.  The girl was abducted on Wednesday morning in Mahendergarh, in the northern state of Haryana, after two of the accused saw her at the bus stop. They offered her water which she believes was spiked and then put her in a car. She told police she was taken to a house about 25 miles  away where a number of other men arrived. The gang then took it in turns to rape her, according to The Times of India. She was eventually driven back to the bus stop and dumped. One of the men phoned her family and told them to collect her. Three of the alleged attackers have been identied as Pankaj, who is in the army, Nishu and Manish. There have been no arrests yet but police have released pictures of the three men in an attempt to find them. The victim is in a local hospital where she has been treated for injuries to her back, shoulders and genitals, according to The Times of India. Her mother told the paper: She has severe pain in her throat, and is unable to talk or swallow anything. They probably held her by the throat, which led to this pain. The family is furious that no arrests have been made so far - and that the authorities were slow to act, according to India Today.

Venkaiah Naidu\u0027s comments were made during a speech calling for Hindi to be the nation\u0027s official language. Addressing an event on Hindi Divas - the day when the Hindi language is celebrated - the politician called on his fellow nationals to relinquish the English language.  “This disease that English left behind, we should rid ourselves of this disease,” he said at the event in New Delhi organised by the Union Home ministry, the Hindustan Times reports.   He instead promoted the spread of Hindi, as the the symbol of socio-political and linguistic unity of the country. Naidu stressed that speaking in one’s mother tongue is what makes people connect and emphasise. Claiming language and emotions “go together”, Naidu said: “If you want to reach out to people…understand them, then you have to properly express your emotions.  “It is easier to express your feeling in one’s mother tongue, in an Indian language. This is everybody’s experience. That’s why one should speak in one’s mother tongue at home,” the Vice President said. He acknowledged that all Indian languages are vibrant and called for literary text in regional languages to be translated into Hindi. Appreciating foreign officials landing in India and adopting their own language, he said: When the Chinese President came here he spoke in his mother tongue.

The jersey sits alongside stuffed bears and gts from Joseph Stalin, Robert Mugabe, Muammar Gaddafi, Fidel Castro and Vladimir Putin. The International Friendship \u0026shyExhibition was built by current leader Kim Jong-Un’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, as a monument to brainwash North Koreans into believing there is “worldwide support for the government”. The Mirror was granted exclusive access during an eight-day visit to the secretive country. But first, our man was issued with a white glove before being allowed to open one of the four-ton doors – last touched by Kim Il-Sung when he opened the exhibition in 1978. Inside the grand building, around 100 miles east of capital Pyongyang and close to Myohyangsan mountain, lies an astonishing collection of disturbing artefacts. More than 115,000 pieces from 188 countries cover six marble floors in this twisted museum of propaganda which proclaims the gts as “proof” that Korean leaders “are revered and admired around the globe”.  There are gts of rhino horn from former Zimbabwe dictator Mugabe in 1985, a golden sword from Libyan tyrant Gaddafi in 1986 and a bulletproof limousine from Soviet leader Stalin in 1950. A crocodile-skin suitcase came from Cuba’s Fidel Castro and a silver tea set from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2001. Three limited edition Spalding basketballs, a gt from former NBA star Dennis Rodman, are behind a huge glass case. Rodman has met basketball-obsessed Kim at least three times since 2013. On his second visit there the star gave Kim a signed jersey from the Harlem Globetrotters, who performed for him in North Korea in 2013.  One room features huge portraits of Kim with world leaders – including a powerful image from his June summit in Singapore with US President Donald Trump. There are stuffed polar bears and towering brown bears – gts from firms in China and Russia. Guarded by henchmen with gleaming silver Kalashnikovs, the centre opened on August 26, 1978, and consists of over 150 rooms covering a huge area of 70,000 square metres. Our guide is Han Jong-Suk, a lady in her 60s with a sweet smile. She proudly tells how she devoted her le to caring for the exhibition so that she could educate the people of Kim’s “great standing” in the world.  She beamed while revealing  you were to spend one minute looking at each artefact it would take more than six months to see everything. Speaking through a government minder who tracked our every move in the country, she said: “I have worked here for 40 years and it is my le’s work and honour. “The exhibition demonstrates for the world to see how respected our great leaders are and how supreme leader Kim Jong-Un is admired as the greatest leader in the world.” As our tour continues two lesize waxwork figures of Kim Il-Sung and his son and heir, Kim Jong-Il, come into view. We are beckoned forward and instructed to bow “in respect”.  Among vastly extravagant gts are more subtle suggestions that this is a place belonging to an alternate reality. A letter of support to Kim Jong-Un from US musician Pras Mich\u0026eacutel, founder of R\u0026ampB band the Fugees, is given prominence. And in another corner, under the banner UK, is the signed Wigan Warriors rugby league jersey and ball, sent in 2014 by the UK arm of the Friends of North Korea.  Our guide tells an outrageous story that US President Jimmy Carter, after meeting Kim Il-Sung in 1984, ed home and “told the American people that Kim Il-Sung was a greater leader than all of George Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln”. Then our minder bizarrely turns to us and says: “Do you believe in the impossible?” As we push open another huge door on the third floor we enter a giant room with a twin propeller plane – a gt from Russia in 1958 – perched in the centre.  Our guide suggests that the plane flew into the room to land... rather than being assembled right there.

I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united pair fyvie and king continue on their road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United pair Fraser Fyvie and Billy King continued their comebacks from injury in the Reserve League Cup on Tuesday.The two made their first appearances of the season in the Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Alloa at the weekend.After coming on late on against the Wasps, this time club captain Fyvie and winger King were both given the full first half.That puts them well down the road to a first-team , though it would be a major surprise  either were to feature in Saturday’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice.After being out since Christmas, Fyvie, in particular, is likely to continue his build-up in the reserves for another couple of weeks.The plan for him is to have him back only once he’s completed a full game for the second string.Their presence saw them help the Tangerines to a 2-1 win over Saints, though both United goals came late in the second period.Matty Smith, with his second goal in two games, levelled after Saints had gone ahead through Jordan Northcott.United then sealed the points from the opening group game when Louis Appere struck 18 minutes from the end.United, meanwhile, have switched their crucial Championship clash at Partick Thistle next month.The game was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, but with both teams’ interest in this season’s Irn-Bru at an end, they’ve brought it forward to Saturday, October 13, with a 3pm kick-off.As well as suiting fans, it means both teams will avoid a three-game week at the end of the month.Had United progressed in the Irn-Bru they would have faced Dunfermline in the third round.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9bdf6c23e00-e1536997183918-113x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"ray mckinnon dundee tried to punt ex captain darren odea to falkirk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew Falkirk manager Ray McKinnon has revealed the deadline day madness at the Championship strugglers – and even had a Dundee defender offered to him with just minutes to go till the window slammed shut.The former Dundee United boss was only in the door for a few hours after his shock switch from Greenock Morton.McKinnon managed to seal a deal for Rangers striker Zak Rudden on loan but narrowly missed out on former Tannadice loanee Anthony Ralston.He also revealed Dundee boss Neil McCann offered the services of former skipper Darren O’Dea as the clock ticked towards midnight.McKinnon said: “We had Darren O’Dea getting punted to us at 10.30 at night by Neil McCann.

Across the road, in Slessor Gardens, celebrations to mark the opening continue with the second day of the 3D Festival.The event will feature a host of on-stage performances and a number of family activities.Things kick off at 11am as musician SHHE – otherwise known as Su Shaw or Panda Su – takes to the stage.She said: “Dundee is special – it doesn’t show off in ways that other cities do – so maybe in the past you had to work harder to find that out.“I’m excited to be joining some incredible local artists on-stage to celebrate its opening.”Keeping the music going from 11.50am will be Kashmir Crows, a six-piece based in the city.The group – who have been likened to bands such as Arcade Fire and Black Keys – play a mix of alternative rock, indie, soul, blues and funk, and are a familiar act on the local music scene.Lead singer Ian Black, from Lochee, said: “We pride ourselves on being a Dundonian band and to be a part of the biggest cultural event in Dundee for generations, we’re totally over the moon. We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm. Featuring Katie Lynch and Mark Johnston, they claim to have crafted a “unique sound” through music “laced with dark tones”.Katie said: “The V\u0026ampA is bringing something new to the creative scene here in Dundee, which has been needing a good refresh. We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b98d992afff4-417x564.jpg ","title":"wins can have dundee united ready to host the teams from the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

Tony Watt was lurking unmarked at the back post for a cross but Andy Considine cut it out with a last gasp clearance for a corner.Aberdeen were looking vulnerable down the flanks and were also offering very little in terms of attack.It was grim viewing for the travelling Red Army.In the 31st minute Saints again threatened when Blair Aston sent a 15 yard glancing header along the face of goal and wide.A first shot of note on target from the Dons finally came in the 35th minute when Gleeson released Logan down the right flank with a cross-field ball.That was the only real effort from the Dons in a grim first 45 minutes for the Pittodrie side.McInnes changed it at half-time by bringing on striker Sam Cosgrove for Forrester.Within a minute of the restart McGinn was denied when his powerful 22 yard drive was pushed wide by keeper Clark.Winger Mackay-Steven injected real urgency when he picked up the ball on the right and cut across into a more central position.He unleashed a vicious 20 yard drive that Jason Kerr headed off the line with the keeper beaten.Moments later Shinnie fired a low drive wide from the edge of the box.Aberdeen did more in attack in the first five minutes of the second half than in the entire first 45 minutes.Keeper Clark did well to get down and block a low drive from Mackay-Steven at his near post.The Dons were denied in the 62nd minute when substitute Cosgrove latched onto a cross 12 yards out delivered by Logan.Cosgrove headed downwards but was denied by a superb save from Clark.Aberdeen were vastly improved in the second half and were running rampant.The goal the Dons second half play merited finally arrived in the 69th minute via a superb free-kick from McGINN.The winger lted a 19 yard effort up over the defensive wall and beyond the ing Clark into the top corner for a deserved equaliser.Moments later Joe Lewis saved a powerful drive from Blair Alston.

He is the referee who sent me off at Celtic. It is what it is.“Devlin has a one-match ban and we have good enough players to fill in for him. Do I think it’s right? I don’t but we deal with it and move on.”Thomson has history with Aberdeen. Logan was sent-off by the whistler following full-time in the 1-0 win at Celtic in the final league game of last season.The Dons appealed Logan’s dismissal but were unsuccessful and the right-back was suspended for the first three domestic games of this campaign.Asked  the SFA outlined why they made the decision on his appeal, he said: “It was explained to me but my argument was explained to them. It was like an hour and a half on the phone with them.“People make their decisions down at Hampden.“I can only say my end of the story and you have a board that will decide what your fate is.“Looking back on it, it was so soft but you cannot cry over spilt milk so I get on with it.”Following the SFA’s explanation for upholding the Devlin red card, the Dons released a statement stating it was “unacceptable”.It also read: “It is imperative for the country’s football authorities to establish consistency and transparency in the appeal and referral process and will engage in dialogue with the SPFL in this regard to seek their assistance.”Aberdeen also insisted VAR needs to be considered.In recent weeks, Rangers’ Alfredo Morelos had a red for a kick at Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna downgraded on appeal to yellow.A three-man panel of ex-grade one officials also looked at a kick out from Rangers\u0026#8217 Allan McGregor at Kristoffer Ajer, of Celtic, and failed to reach a unanimous conclusion it was a red-card offence.Kilmarnock’s Gary Dicker had an appeal for a red card for a fair tackle rejected by the separate appeals panel which dealt with both Devlin’s and Morelos’ cases.Logan insists recent decisions have bred confusion. He said: “It seems like you don’t know what you can do these days that gets a red card.“With me, it was like what is tolerable? Do people think decisions are wrong? Definitely. It could have been resolved but they chose not to.”Logan accepts officials do have dficult tasks and in the cut and thrust of games, errors are inevitable. What should also be inevitable is that those mistakes are rectied on appeal. He said: “Referees do have a tough job.“However,  they get a decision wrong and it goes to where you can look at it again sometimes you still don’t get the right outcome.“There is no bad feeling towards referees. Some are lenient, some aren’t.“There are dferent types of referees, just like there are dferent types of players, linesmen and managers.“They have tough decisions and everyone can’t be right.”An SFA statement read: “We are always open to making the system more transparent with written reasons for fast-track proceedings now published on the Scottish FA website alongside details of all notices of complaint and claims lodged and dealt with under the judicial panel protocol.“The clubs, players and managers are represented in the ongoing review of the judicial panel protocol and we will welcome any input this season through our usual processes.“In addition, our referee operations department will continue to offer the opportunity to clubs to be refreshed on the current coaching guidance given to referees and any modications to the laws of the game in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen baker boss david aitken fuelled demand for sickening material says charity1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA national children’s charity said an Aberdeen man jailed after he was caught with almost 16,000 indecent images of children had “fuelled” the demand for the “sickening” material.As was reported in later editions of yesterday’s Evening Express, David Aitken, 60, was jailed for 18 months when he appeared at the city’s sherf court for sentencing after being found with 15,961 indecent images of children and 405 videos.Aitken, a partner in Aitkens Bakery, admitted taking or permitting to be taken or making indecent images of children as well as possessing the material.The offences took place between March 16 2010 and September 11 2017.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

This year they are ing with new material.Citizen 9 are currently putting their finishing touches to their long-awaited debut album, so keep a look out for it.MOJO kicks off on Saturday October 20 with tickets now available from Argyll Book Centre, Oban Music and Ardfern stores for £8 or £10 at the door.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"spot the yellow bus of the travelling gallery in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 12/09/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Travelling Gallery arrived in Lochgilphead on Wednesday August 29, stopping at Lochgilphead Joint Campus to share art with the students.Glasgow-based artist Gordon Douglas pulled up in the colourful bus to bring his new solo exhibition Black Box Take Stock to Lochgilphead to mark the Travelling Gallery’s 40th birthday.The Travelling Gallery bus was established in 1978 and continues to bring contemporary art to communities throughout Scotland.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cakes and coffee make a zambian difference","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 3:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowZamScotEd, the Mid Argyll-based charity that supports education in Zambia, is close to achieving three of the UN’s sustainable development goals in Lusaka, where its secondary school is steadily growing.If you pop in to ZamScotEd’s next coffee morning in Lochgilphead Parish Church Hall, you will help to put the icing on the cake of St Columba’s third classroom block – the science building that will enable pupils to forge ahead and gain qualications to work in their country’s industries and professions.ZamScotEd founder, Marian Pallister, was back in Zambia this summer to check on the progress of the much needed secondary school the organisation initiated in one of the poorest communities on the fringe of Lusaka.She said: \u0026#8216Progress has been amazing. St Columba\u0026#8217s Community Secondary Day School opened in January 2016 with one classroom block match funded by Missio Scotland.Last year, with the help of the Spanish organisation Manos Unidas, the second classroom block opened and there was an amazing 100 per cent pass rate for the important Grade 9 exam – roughly equating to our Nat 5. Now, with funding from another Spanish organisation, Africa Directo, the science block has been built and ZamScotEd is committed to completing the interior and providing the furniture and equipment.\u0026#8217Marian added that Manos Unidas have just agreed to fund the fourth and final classroom block.There are now 190 pupils at the school, which is run by ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s Zambian partners, the Teresian Sisters, and there are 95 boys and 95 girls.\u0026#8216Our aims are to meet three of the UN\u0026#8217s sustainable development goals,\u0026#8217 Marian continued. \u0026#8216Goal number four is quality education, and head teacher Sr Veronica Nyoni and her team  are achieving that.\u0026#8216Goal number five is gender equality – and we\u0026#8217re spot on there. These two can lead to Goal number one, which is to eliminate poverty. If these youngsters get a good education that leads to worthwhile employment, they will be able to turn around their own communities.\u0026#8217Every penny from events like ZamScotEd\u0026#8217s coffee mornings goes to enhance the school and the lives of these Zambia children.Marian concluded: \u0026#8216ZamScotEd can\u0026#8217t thank our community here enough.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the best of music food and festival fun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/09/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSet in the stunning grounds of Inveraray Castle, Best of the West is a firm favourite in the Scottish festival calendar.People of all ages came to enjoy the three-day celebration of the best in music, food, drink, arts and crafts \u0026#8211 and family fun.The weather gods were mercul for the Friday September 7 opening, featuring big crowds and a cracking atmosphere in anticipation of a great weekend of entertainment.And, the odd heavy Sunday shower aside , the weather stayed fine for the whole event.For the kids there was face painting \u0026#8211 also surprisingly popular among mildly lubricated adults \u0026#8211 as well as the ever popular climbing wall, dancing teacups and much more.Top-notch fare in the Food from Argyll tent proved as big a draw as it does every year, while local artists showcased a myriad of crafts and artwork in their own popular marquee.Top chefs from award-winning restaurants showed off their skills in the Festival Kitchen, including Calum Hall, head chef at Loch Fyne Oysters, Samphire chef and owner Andrew MacLugash  and Masterchef 2016 winner Gary MacLean.With 24 bands performing across the two stages, this was a real musical treat in relaxed surroundings.Music and the amber nectar poured from the Whisky tent in a mellow blend of conviviality.

Former Runrig frontman Donnie Munro delighted audience members of a certain age with songs old and new on Saturday evening. At the opposite end of the experience spectrum, Cowal outfit Heron Valley showed why they are currently home in between US tours.The energetic Celtic sound of American band Seven Nations had the Friday night joint jumping ahead of Tide Lines, lead singer Robert Robertson all blue eyes and boundless energy.Arguably the Saturday show was stolen by the colour, noise and drama of the Bhangra Beatles \u0026#8211 with Fab Four favourites handed an Indian twist of spice.Argyll acts held their own and more among illustrious company.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

last week, when retired local GP John Wilson undertook the same 87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked  it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.  Darren\u0026rsquos mum, Shirley, has been busy ensuring it is a fun day at the lighthouse.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Explaining how the role came about, Debs said: \u0026ldquoI basically got a call asking  I could speak to production. It was quite surreal. I didn\u0026rsquot have to audition or anything.  The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley. Their next show is The Naked Truth, running on November 2 and 3.  \u0026ldquoQuirky Pond is getting bigger and bigger, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe Naked Truth will have two days at The Brunton [in Musselburgh].  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about five women who take up pole dancing classes, for a iety of reasons. One of the characters finds out she has cancer, so she wants to have a fundraiser.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a mix between Calendar Girls and The Full Monty but we all keep our clothes on.  But Debs still keeps an eye on Centre Stage with everything else going on.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove offered to help  they need me but I think they\u0026rsquore doing quite well themselves, she said.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom going to try and get to their panto this year.  \u0026ldquoNext year is their 40th year, so it\u0026rsquos a big anniversary for them.

Instead, it would work to bring a consortium of non-government organisations and philanthropists to organise a buyout, the source said, but that any plan was in a \u0026ldquovery preliminary stage.  The news comes a week after independent MP Frank Field called on Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby asking him to find \u0026ldquogood people to buy Wonga\u0026rsquos loan book.  Existing borrowers are thought to total around 200,000, and Mr Field said he feared they could be left at the mercy of money lenders and bailfs who could purchase the debt at a knockdown price.  In a letter to the archbishop, he said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIs there a possibility please of you asking the Church Commissioners quickly to assemble a consortium of good people with money who will attempt to buy those poor people\u0026rsquos loan books at a knockdown price?          THREAD \u0026ndash Wonga\u0027s loan books are likely to be sold and,  the past record is any guide to the future, those loans will probably be sold at knockdown rates. Within these loan books are likely to be some devoted exclusively to the exploitation of the poor.          \u0026mdash Frank Field MP  September 6, 2018  He said swt action by the church would stop a new lender \u0026ldquoterrorising the poor and would be \u0026ldquoan example of the jubilee in setting slaves free of their debts.  According to the Book of Leviticus, a jubilee year occurs every 50th year, during which slaves and prisoners are freed and debts forgiven.  Administrator Grant Thornton is running Wonga\u0026rsquos loan book while it looks for a buyer.  Mr Field said that such a purchase led by the Church of England could mark the beginning of a \u0026ldquopeople\u0026rsquos bank.  He told the Press Association: \u0026ldquoWonga targeted people who are beyond the abyss.  \u0026ldquoThis is an ambulance rescue operation, but longer term we need to look at offering long-term credit, through a people\u0026rsquos bank, for those who are in urgent need.  A spokesman for the Church of England said: \u0026ldquoWe are reflecting on what may or may not be possible in the months ahead regarding the repercussions following Wonga\u0026rsquos collapse.  In 2013 the Archbishop was forced to admit the Church of England\u0026rsquos investment fund had invested indirectly in Wonga.  Although the sum was small \u0026ndash about \u0026pound75,000 out of investments totalling \u0026pound5.5 billion \u0026ndash he described it as embarrassing.  \u0026ldquoIt shouldn\u0026rsquot happen, it\u0026rsquos very embarrassing, but these things do happen and we have to find out why and make sure it doesn\u0026rsquot happen again, Archbishop Welby said at the time."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8689201.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"number-in-novichok-suspects-passport-file-reached-russian-military-says-report","story":"  Belligcat, an online investigative organisation headquartered in the UK, published a phone number on Friday that it said came from what it described as the passport records of Alexander Petrov.

Perth Sherf Court was told on Wednesday that the assault conviction was likely to lead to his dismissal from his job driving vulnerable people for the local authority.  Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sherf Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light. After a second or two I came too with my we screaming.  \"I had a lump on the side of my head which the policeman described as the size of a small egg. I don\u0027t think I could believe it.\"  Mr Wall said he told McIntosh he was calling the police and that prompted him to usher the fans back into the bus and drive off.  McIntosh, Stewart Crescent, Barrhead, was found guilty of assaulting Mr Wall on the A9 by punching him on the head to his injury on 16 April 2017.  He was acquitted on a second charge of driving dangerously by overtaking when it was unsafe to so and colliding with the rear of Mr Wall\u0027s car.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"a-new-beginning-for-dundee","story":"  August and the sun is shining. Down at the city\u0026rsquos waterfront, outside the new Sleeperz hotel, next to the revamped train station entrance, a group of Japanese tourists are sitting on the large sculpted pebbles that dot the forecourt. A new office block is under construction across the street and in Slessor Gardens there\u0026rsquos a women\u0026rsquos yoga class going en plein air  Not so very long ago this was all concrete and tarmac round here. Now everything has changed. And the change is spreading beyond the waterfront too. In the streets around and behind the Malmaison hotel you can find a smattering of new shops, delis and vegan cafes .  And this in a city that only two years ago was seen as an entrepreneurial black spot. In 2015 the Courier reported that in there had been only 48 applications for grants to StartUp Britain in the previous three years. Now Dundee appears to be open for business.  This is the new face of the city. But it\u0026rsquos down at the waterfront that you will see its most visible manestation.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee, which opens today, is the reason that, for the first time in many years you might say, the city is suddenly hip, \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos coolest city, according to the Wall Street Journal. Vogue has also been singing the city\u0026rsquos praises.  The changes are being noticed by locals too. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see more restaurants, shops, fashion labels launching, says fashion designer Hayley Scanlan, herself a Dundee native. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos so much happening. Young people are doing their own thing. It\u0026rsquos amazing and inspirational. People have had the guts to do stuff because they can see there is an opportunity.  The prospect of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, she says, has \u0026ldquobrought light to the city.  And yet there are still shadows. Some of them are the shadows that every modern city contends with. Things like the death of the high street for one.   Other shadows are darker. It was revealed earlier this year that one in four children in the city live in poverty.  This is a city that has suffered as much as any in the post-industrial age with widescale loss of jobs . And in some families unemployment has become generational.  Suspicions about the hype and hope that surrounds Dundee at the moment is perhaps to some extent understandable After all Dundee has had more than its unfair share of failed regenerations in the past. The new museum sits on one of them. Once the city\u0026rsquos dock, it was torn up in the 1960s \u0026ndash including an arch built to commemorate the visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to the city in the 19th century \u0026ndash to create slip roads off the bridge.  Still, the V\u0026ampA Dundee is part of the city\u0026rsquos attempt to rewrite a reputation that has for years \u0026ndash maybe even decades - been written off.  The question is how did we get here? What has allowed this to happen and what might it lead to?  Few people are better equipped to answer all of this than Mike Galloway. Galloway grew up in Glasgow and Perth  and, after a successful career in urban planning in Glasgow where he worked on the regeneration of the Merchant City and the Gorbals, he became Dundee\u0026rsquos Director of City Planning in 1997.  Today, sitting on the top floor of Dundee House looking out over the Tay Estuary, he is remembering the city he found 21 years ago.  \u0026ldquoIts image was extremely poor he recalls. \u0026ldquoReally poor. Its self-image was really poor. Dundonians did not regard their city very highly.  They were not the only ones. When he told colleagues in Glasgow he was moving to Dundee they thought he was crazy. \u0026ldquoThey thought it was a coffin job, he admits.  \u0026ldquoWe were losing population hand over fist and  that continued the whole infrastructure of the city was under threat.  But when he applied for the job, he says, there were already signs that Dundee wanted things to change.  \u0026ldquoWhat I found was a city that was really determined to reinvent itself. There was a whole campaign to put the heart back into the city, to try to recover Dundee\u0026rsquos reputation, its image, to try and recapture its retail catchment area, for example. It was on the verge.  \u0026ldquoThere was an effort to restructure the economy away from manufacturing to knowledge-based. Back in the mid-1990s that was very dangerous, very Avant Garde, particularly for a strong Labour council to be proposing that.  In a way that sense of incipient change was what drew him here. He\u0026rsquod first lived in Dundee was a student in the mid-1970s, and a couple of decades later, he ed for a joint 40th birthday party with his we.\u0026nbsp  Walking around the city that weekend he was impressed by the changes from the city he knew 20 years earlier. A few weeks later he saw the ad in the paper for his job and he applied. \u0026ldquoI tell the story that I came to Dundee for a party and I never left, he says, smiling.  It was a good time to come, he says. Things were changing. Within two years the DCA would open, giving the city\u0026rsquos image a boost. The universities were beginning to help establish the city\u0026rsquos reputation as a centre of design . In some areas the city was on an upswing.  That didn\u0026rsquot mean more changes weren\u0026rsquot needed. \u0026ldquoThe one place that really let the city down was the waterfront, where the Tay Bridge came in and joined in the city centre, recalls Galloway. It was just a morass of motorways, bridges, brutalist buildings. And yet that was Dundee\u0026rsquos front door. That\u0026rsquos where you arrived, whether by train or by car. That was your first impression and first impressions stick.  His solution, complete redevelopment of the waterfront. A project with a timeframe that stretched to decades. Urban regeneration is rarely a quick fix. That redevelopment has been a priority for the city ever since.  There were strokes of good fortune along the way. Dundee was able to benefit from the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Cities Growth Fund. It made the decision to channel all that money into the waterfront. The city also managed to tap funds from Scottish Enterprise and did the same with it.  And all of this, it should be noted, has been done over the last decade in the teeth of recession.  \u0026ldquoBut in some ways that was an advantage, suggests Galloway. \u0026ldquoBecause we got really keen prices. The fact that there wasn\u0026rsquot a buoyant development market out there wasn\u0026rsquot problematic. We got good prices. We got really committed contractors to work with because there was a dearth of business for them elsewhere.  The idea of a museum on the waterfront wasn\u0026rsquot part of the original masterplan. But, Galloway says, they were looking for a big idea. That big idea arrived over food in 2007.  Early that year Sir Mark Jones, the then director of the V\u0026ampA museum, was in Dundee to have a look at what was going on at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. The college laid on a lunch for him and invited a selection of guests from the city. Galloway was one of them.  \u0026ldquoThe \u0026lsquoBilbao effect\u0026rsquo was very big at the time, Galloway recalls, referring to the impact Frank Gehry\u0026rsquos Guggenheim museum had on the economy of the northern Spanish city. \u0026ldquoWe were explaining to him what we\u0026rsquore doing on the waterfront here and he was interested, so we said: \u0026lsquoLook, before you get your flight back can we show you around?\u0026rsquo  Jones said yes. A few days later he called Galloway and said he\u0026rsquod like to continue the conversation. The idea of V\u0026ampA Dundee was in utero.  The story of the building of Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos design is a saga in itself, a story of reigning in the original ambition and an inflationary budget   This week another argument emerged when Chrissie Hynde, of all people, moaned about the office block being built just across the road from the museum, calling it a \u0026ldquomonstrosity which should be torn down.  Galloway argues that it is part of the change that Dundee needs. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is an anchor building in the waterfront development that will encourage tourists and business tourists . But it can\u0026rsquot stand alone.  Right now, though, the museum itself is an opportunity to change the city\u0026rsquos image. Philip Long, the V\u0026ampA Dundee director, suggests that, in fact, it\u0026rsquos already happening. \u0026ldquoThe city is reclaiming its waterfront and it has had the ambition to go out and award the most amazing building project to Kengo Kuma which is now not just being used to portray Dundee but is being used in the Scotland Now campaign. So, the city is being understood in dferent ways.  The interest from Vogue and the Wall Street Journal would suggest as much.  But just how far does that understanding go in the city itself?  On Dundee\u0026rsquos Whitfield estate in the north of the city, tucked in behind a low-rise office block there is a garden of remembrance. At the entrance of this \u0026ldquoGarden of Hope row upon row of brass tags hang on the fence. On each is inscribed a message of love and loss.  Barrie, 51, is a service manager with Addaction, a national charity set up to help those suffering from dependency issues. Every day he meets with drug addicts and their families in the area and offers support and comfort.  \u0026ldquoWhat we are trying to do is create a place where people can come together and support one another and also try and heal a little bit, he explains  There is a lot of healing to be done. Last year Dundee took over from Glasgow as the city with the highest number of drug deaths per resident in the country .  Barrie is all too aware of the impact those deaths can have on family members and friends. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom supporting one family that has lost three sons to overdoses, he says. We\u0026rsquore hearing about eight-year-old girls who are self-harming after losing their mums to drugs.  \u0026ldquoThere was a guy in this morning who has lost about a dozen close people to drug death. If you\u0026rsquore coping with that level of loss on top of your own issues it\u0026rsquos hard and drugs and alcohol, as we know, are a way of coping for a lot of people. It\u0026rsquos not a good way. It\u0026rsquos a very dangerous way.  Drug deaths, Barrie suggests, is harder to talk about than cancer. There is a huge stigma involved.  But over and above everything else, he says, poverty is the major contributory factory. Last year it was revealed that in the previous five years Dundee had more benefit sanctions applied than anywhere else in the country.  \u0026ldquoSo, masses of this will be to do with poverty and lack of aspiration or lack of choices, Barrie suggests. \u0026ldquoYou put it all together we\u0026rsquore at the head of a storm.  It only takes a few minutes to drive from the waterfront to Whitfield but at times the distance must seem huge.  Barrie himself is excited about the museum opening and about taking some of his clients to see it. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a fantastic opportunity for Dundee. I get goose bumps even thinking about it.  But he also worries that it might have an alienating effect on those he works with. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom wondering  the V\u0026ampA is almost reinforcing the hopelessness in a weird way. It\u0026rsquos so beautul, so perfect \u0026hellip If your le is the opposite of that \u0026hellip \u0026ldquo  It\u0026rsquos something that concerns Hayley Scanlan too. \u0026ldquoI just think all this hope is being put into this one thing and are people going to be disappointed? What is the backlash going to be?  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the old analogy that when the tide comes in all the boats rise, says Galloway. \u0026ldquoThe problem in cities like Dundee is that some of the boats are chained to the bottom and they\u0026rsquore not going to benefit unless we do something specically to make it happen.  \u0026ldquoOne of the key challenges I\u0026rsquove been given by the council and politicians is to ensure the waterfront has meaning in terms of jobs and income for everybody in the city. So, the fact that we\u0026rsquove committed to the living wage in the waterfront is not the usual sticker badge in it. It\u0026rsquos genuine.  When Sleeperz came to Dundee wanting to operate the hotel at the waterfront, Galloway explains, the city told the hoteliers they would have to pay the living wage. They were initially reticent because of the cost and the precedent. But in tandem with the council they found a workaround and now the company is going to introduce the living wage in all its hotels.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos through that kind of activity that we are much more likely to have a waterfront and things in that waterfront that really mean something to people in Whitfield and all of the communities across the city.  Philip Long believes it would be wrong to suggest that the V\u0026ampA Dundee is some kind of panacea for all of the city\u0026rsquos issues. It can help with economic investment, he says, \u0026ldquobut we\u0026rsquore only part of everything else that is going on.  What it does offer, he adds, is a facility that can help make a dference to people\u0026rsquos lives in the city, whether that is through employment or even just inspiration.  And people are being inspired. Dundee is changing. Hayley Scanlan is a walking example of that. There would have been a time, she admits, when she would have had to move away to be able to establish her fashion label. But the internet has changed all that and Scanlan, 35, has been able to build her business and raise twin boys in the city of her birth.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a supportive place. I have a huge support network in Dundee. I opened the shop a year and a half ago and it\u0026rsquos just been unbelievable. Seeing strangers walking down the street wearing my clothes \u0026hellip I can\u0026rsquot even put it into words.  Today the V\u0026ampA Dundee opens. Next month, Mike Galloway retires. It\u0026rsquos time to hand on the reins to someone else, he says. Walking me back to the elevator, he points down the estuary where three oil rigs can be seen. \u0026ldquoWe started looking at decommissioning a couple of years ago and we got laughed at. Now we\u0026rsquove got some major companies looking to base themselves in Dundee for this emerging new industry.  For Galloway this is a new beginning for Dundee. This is a city with problems, some of them huge and grievous, but progress is being made. In the future the city will look dferent, will be more confident, erse and complex, he hopes.  If so, that will bring its own problems of course, Galloway admits.  \u0026ldquoIt will be interesting 20 years from now to see  people are moaning about the number of tourists."},{"url":null,"title":"what-can-we-do-about-the-scourge-of-jobsworths","story":"  I\u0026rsquove been trying to cut down recently so it was going to be a treat. Sad as it sounds, I\u0026rsquod been anticipating it all day.  Ah, let me check my purse. Darn it, I\u0026rsquove only got \u0026pound2.23.  She suggested I have a cup of tea for \u0026pound1.80 instead. I wasn\u0026rsquot after a cup of tea and certainly not for \u0026pound1.80.  \u0026ldquoYou could go along the street to the cash machine. I had a taxi on the way and not much time.  So, my coffee was lost for want of a 2p piece.  I did eight years\u0027 labour in a coffee shop and I can tell you this much, I would have made the 2p up.  \u0026ldquoJobsworth, I whined to the taxi driver, all the way back to work in a funk.  My barista jobsworth absolutely pales in comparison to the hard graft put in by a manager of a Toby Carvery who denied a terminally ill woman a small plate.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos right. The rules of a chain roast dinner restaurant are sacrosanct. One must take what one is given and be glad, even when one is dying.  A woman in Merseyside visited her local Toby Carvery and asked for a child\u0026rsquos plate. Lynn Deer has terminal stomach cancer, resulting in most of the organ being removed. She hasn\u0026rsquot, you\u0026rsquoll sympathise, much of an appetite.  Child\u0026rsquos plates are for the under-12s and there will be no exceptions. She tried to show the manager a medical card but the lady in charge was not for turning. I tell you what, I didn\u0026rsquot expect to spend my Wednesday afternoon in a minor Twitter spat with Toby Carvery but the chain\u0026rsquos pathetic, mealy-mouthed non-apology left me seeing red. They appreciate my feedback.  Jobsworths are the scourge of polite society. What can we do about them?  In this instance, staff cannot be taught empathy but they can have disability awareness drummed into them, so let\u0026rsquos hope\u0026nbspsome staff training is afoot.  Good customer service matters so much because bad service is to steal someone\u0026rsquos time. It\u0026rsquos a mini manslaughter \u0026ndash who among us has time to give away? You are taking a little piece of someone else\u0026rsquos le.  Ma Stewart was a bit stressed about catching her train the other week and, because of her hearing loss, didn\u0026rsquot realise she was shouting at the station staff member.  Instead of taking umbrage, the ScotRail worker helped her through the barrier, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquoYou go with her, allowing me on to the platform without a ticket and without me having even asked.  What a dference it made, that small, thoughtful gesture.  We have an increasingly elderly population, a society that is increasingly moving online. It seems odd to me that my older neighbour won\u0026rsquot set up a direct debit for his council tax but, on reflection, it\u0026rsquos a day out to pay it in person with guaranteed human interaction.  Imagine that you\u0026rsquore a person\u0026rsquos only face-to-face connection that day and you make them feel bad, you rattle them, you deprive them of something they were excited for.  This all resonates so much because I was once that jobsworth. Back in my coffee shop days, while I\u0026rsquod have let you off with coppers, I was as compliant with company policy as they come.  We\u0026rsquod been told not to give cream in coffee because it curdled. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquot, does it? But what I was told, I believed.  Every morning the back of 6am a taxi driver would come in for his coffee with cream. Would I give him it? Would I coco.  When he insisted, I would give him a cup with an 80/20 split \u0026ndash in favour of the cream.  I shudder now to think of how he must have dreaded to see me. An irritating little madam setting his day off to a tense and fat-laden start. I am filled with shame.  I saw him not that long ago on Sauchiehall Street and wanted to chase after him to apologise. Of course, that would have been awkward for him and serve only selfish me.  So what changed? Maturity, mainly. But for many jobsworths, age is no excuse.  How to encourage everyday kindness to strangers? I think it starts small and spreads, as mawkish as that may sound. Send it out in waves, each little act at a time.  But it\u0026rsquos vital to go in at the top. Our current insecure labour market does nothing for the discouragement of jobsworths. The pressure is twofold:  your work is precarious, why care? And  you\u0026rsquore at risk of a short term contract being renewed, there\u0026rsquos no incentive to risk using your initiative and overriding company policy.  So, be kind, complain and compliment. Be kind to staff but complain furiously to companies that implement ridiculous policies. And compliment where a job\u0026rsquos well done.  Jobsworths can be overcome common sense must win the day."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-closing-in-on-brexit-deal-with-brussels-suggests-raab","story":"  The Brexit Secretary issued a statement following an \u0026ldquoextended phone call this morning with Michel Barnier about the latest progress both sides\u0026rsquo teams had made on the Withdrawal Agreement and the framework for the future relationship.  \"While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship, said Mr Raab.  \"Looking ahead, we agreed to review the state of play in the negotiations following the informal meeting of heads of state or government of the European Union in Salzburg next Thursday, and we reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.

Together Karen Darke and Ken Talbot have become Scotland\u0027s newest world record holders - in hand-cycling.  Both speed feats were performed while sat inside Arion4 an enclosed hand bicycle pod designed by engineering students from the University of Liverpool in which the riders only see the road on a screen.  Whether it is hand-cycling across the Himalayas, sit skiing across the Greenland ice cap or travelling or climbing the 3,000-foot clf El Capitan in Yosemite, Inverness\u0027s Karen Darke is in her element.    But the 47-year-old\u0027s latest escapade with Mr Talbot set against the golden yellow sand carpet of the semi-arid Nevada desert is far away from the extreme adventures she has devoured - and has amazed some of her closest colleagues.  This time it is about human powered bicycle speed racing and even watching it is not easy.  The instructions for spectators on the desert plateau spell out the dficulties - limited parking and no services and warnings that warm clothing is needed for the cold of the mornings and evenings.  On two consecutive days as the sun came up on Nevada State Route 305 she broke the female hand-cycle land speed record not once, but twice over the flat 2.5 mile course. And in so doing she even managed to surpass an old men\u0026rsquos world which had been standing for seven years. In her velocipede on Wednesday morning she set a speed of 41.86mph - 17mph faster than the previous world record.    Pictures by ULV team  But she was merely warming up, because on Thursday morning she added nearly 5mph to her own mark with a speed of 46.05mph.  Before the arrival on American soil, the arm powered male world record was 45.68 mph and was set in September 2011 by Greg Westlake from Avos Arrow. The female world record was a mere 24.85mph and was set in September 2016 by Sarah Piercy from Plymouth University.  It is, perhaps, apt that Ms Darke who was victorious for Great Britain in hand cycling at the 2016\u0027s Rio Paralympics, should complete the feat near the quiet town of Battle Mountain, dubbed \u0027the town that gold mining saved\u0027.  \"I surprised myself,\" she said Ms Darke, who admitted that she \"freaked out\" when first trying out the enclosed bike she described as \"like an egg\".      \"It is one of the most surreal experiences of my le, because to sit in this pod and crank it up that highway, because I have never done it before, well it feels pretty extreme,\" she said. But it did not end there, as Mr Talbot who with Ms Darke are part of the University of Liverpool Velodipede team broke the men\u0027s record and became the first hand-cyclist to go over 50mph in history with a time of 51.86mph.  Mr Talbot, who got into hand-cycling ten years ago had his training disrupted for a week and a half because of flu but said: \"When I was a little kid, I wanted to be one of the people who went up there and set a record.\"    Both were taking part in the 19th annual World Human Powered Speed Challenge where teams from France, Russia, Japan, Canada, Italy, Mexico, USA, the Netherlands and Britain, bring their high-tech pedal powered bikes to achieve amazing speeds.  The high altitude and arrow straight section of road has attracted athletes worldwide to test their speed bike designs and sprinting abilities since 2000.  The thin air at 4,619ft altitude reduces aerodynamic drag, which coupled with the five mile long acceleration zone enables the bikes to reach their maximum velocity before being timed over a 200 metre distance.  For Ms Darke, this was an interlude in her latest adventure, Quest 79, a project to undertake a total of nine hand-bike rides on seven continents while raising money for charity and encouraging others to take on their own challenges.    \"After Rio I was looking for a new challenge and I heard about this event and I just fancied it,\" she said. \"This was the first time the University of Liverpool had produced a hand-powered bike so I went to visit them and basically said I want to be your female rider. And they said it was okay.  \"I never sat in it until a week before I came our here when I had a few runs on an old runway somewhere near Manchester. So I was on a big learning curve and it was such a surreal experience to be sat in, basically, an egg. It\u0027s very very dferent to riding a regular hand-bike.  \"The first time I tried it on the first day I freaked out. I did go fast but your senses are completely altered. It is so noisy inside and all you can see is the road on a screen. It\u0027s not the actual road.  \"You are just adjusting to everything, the dimensions are dferent, there\u0027s no window, your depth of field is distorted, there are so many things that are new. It has hardly any steering so  there is a gust of wind it blows you off and it is hard to correct it.\"    She was 21 when she fell about 33 feet off a sea clf while rock climbing in Scotland, breaking her skull, arms, neck and back. After three days in a coma, she woke up and was told she was paralysed from the chest down. She\u0027s been in a wheelchair ever since.  Her first expedition after her accident was a hand-bike ride along the Silk Route from Kazakhstan to Pakistan in the Himalayas in 1997 and others followed.  \"Why do I do these things? It\u0027s like trying to say why you are the way you are. I like challenging myself. I like adventures. I like the whole experience that it brings of meeting people and having new experiences and new encounters.  \"Le is to be lived and experienced and that\u0027s what I like to do.\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"snp-members-criticise-campaign-fronted-by-partys-public-finance-minister","story":"  A motion to be tabled at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference raises concerns over the impact of banning single-use plastic straws.

He said: \"I am much more interested in what teachers and parents have to say about these tests than I am in watching John Swinney\u0027s civil servants push buttons on a screen.  \"Teachers, campaigners and EIS Scotland have lambasted these tests as a waste of effort yet the Education Secretary is point blank refusing to listen.  \"The clock is now ticking down until Parliament votes to scrap them.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest. There is so much to do and see in rural parts and right across Aberdeenshire and we must do all we can to maximise the opportunities for tourism and economic growth by attracting new visitors to the North-east.”Chris Foy, VisitAberdeenshire Chief Executive, added: “The event reflected the importance of rural tourism for the North-east which is a signicant priority set within the destination strategy for the next five years.“It is encouraging to see the strong desire from local industry to work alongside VisitScotland and VisitAberdeenshire to strengthen the appeal of the destination to visitors, and the quality of the experience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire man s life saving call on honeymoon","story":"        Nick and Philippa Allan got married last August and just a week later received a call that changed their lives.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a le-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were ing.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my le so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney  had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his le and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a le as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my le had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some dficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new le.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the dference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gt that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a le free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gt – enjoying le to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive dference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new le basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gt.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my le and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gt.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage. It has been a delight to watch Hope develop into a self-assured and confident young lady who is always keen to represent the views and opinions of young people from Orkney and beyond!”Jack Norquoy said: \u0026#8220I\u0026#8217m absolutely delighted to be part of the panel to represent the work of SYP, young folk in Orkney, and crucially help to ensure we see a progression, not a regression of young people\u0026#8217s rights in Brexit.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Saturday 15 Sep 2018 11:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

The Milnfua Rt Raft crew took third place. The Mermaids may have been pipped at the post but made a splash all the same as fancy dress winners.The RNLI all-weather Trent Class leboat then vividly displayed the challenges crews face when undertaking a rescue with a vessel aground during exciting demonstrations.A craft village organised by Gloria Mackenzie was a treat for landlubbers with everything from pebble art to quilts and engraving on display.A pet show also proved a pull with a iety of prizes handed out.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4800649.1537039818!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon i would spend my days hiding under the table reading","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon is in her Holyrood office, a Joan Eardley painting on the wall behind her and Paul Auster\u0026#8217s daunting slab of a novel 4 3 2 1 on her desk. Plucked from my own book shelves, it is part-prop, part-symbol of my inadequacy. Its pristine condition betrays that I have hardly opened it. For more than a year it has taunted me with its enormous bulk. A couple of times, I have lted it down with good intent, then replaced it, unable to commit to its 866 pages.                Sturgeon may have a country to run, but she has read it not only has she read it, but she can critique it, explaining the premise to me in detail and adding that, while she liked parts of it, she wouldn’t particularly recommend it.            Sturgeon is that rare thing: a politician who devours fiction. Novels, she says, provide both a shelter from political storms and a means of gaining a deeper  understanding of the human condition.              The First Minister is evangelical about her pastime. Many Saturday nights, she will tweet a picture of her latest literary dalliance, and once or twice a year, her recommendations from her summer/winter reading. Then, for a fleeting moment, Twitter becomes that little bit less toxic, as bibliophiles from across the political ide drop their sniping to chip in with their own opinions.Sturgeon has eclectic tastes. Her Christmas recommendations featured six crime novels, but also a dozen others including George Saunders’ Lincoln in the Bardo and Jenner Egan’s Manhattan Beach. The thread had 618 RTs and 2.8k likes, suggesting many people appreciate a First Minister with a hinterland.She is also rapidly becoming a regular at festivals. During the Edinburgh Book Festival, she interviewed Ali Smith. And on Friday she will be in conversation with author Damian Barr at a an event at the Wigtown Book Festival. As a kind of taster, Sturgeon has carved out half an hour to talk to me about the important role reading plays in her le. First and foremost, she says, books help her to relax. I am lucky enough to witness this first-hand. When I arrive, she is tense and aloof as you might expect of a leader going through the toughest period of her four-year tenure. But as she starts talking about reading, she smiles, all the formality melts away, and you can almost see her shrugging off the troubles of the day.            Sturgeon tells me she discovered the joys of reading early most of her childhood memories revolve around books and particularly Saturday morning trips to Irvine Library.  “There is something quite calming about being surrounded by shelves and shelves of books, so I liked the whole experience of being in a library. It probably is what really introduced me to the power of losing yourself in reading,” she says.“I remember at my fth birthday party, hiding under the table with a book, while everyone played games around me. I remember my mum sort of saying: ‘Would  you come out? We have people here’. But, you know,  it was up to me, I would spend still most of my days hiding under the table reading. I really haven’t changed.”Right now, no-one could blame Sturgeon for wanting to hide under a table. In the weeks  since the sex allegations against her friend and mentor Alex Salmond became public she has been under huge personal and political pressure in addition she is under fire over some of her education policies, in particular standardised testing for P1s. So is  reading helping her through these dficult days? “I have no idea what you mean,” she chuckles.             Joking aside, she says she reads consistently, a few pages every night before sleep claims her and most Saturday nights. “But I probably value reading more at times of stress because it takes your mind away from what you might be worrying about. I also find reading – even  you are reading about something not remotely connected to the issues you are dealing with – gives you a dferent perspective on things.”Her favourite book –  she had to choose one – is Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s Sunset Song, with its strong female protagonist Chris Guthrie. “Sunset Song opened my eyes to parts of the country I didn’t know and it has a very strong  female lead character, although it’s set around about the time of WWI,” she says.“I think that probably had an impact on my thinking around gender and feminism, although other writers such as Edna O’Brien and Alice Walker which I read in my mid- to late-teens also played a part.”Interestingly, all three of the non-fiction books she recommended at Christmas 2017 – Mary Beard’s Women and Power, Hillary Clinton’s What Happened and Coretta Scott King’s My Le, My Love, My Legacy – have feminist undercurrents. “I  don’t read a lot of non-fiction,” Sturgeon says. “I have enough non-fiction to keep me occupied, but when I do, it’s likely to be stuff I can take something from. The Hillary Clinton book, for example: whatever you think of her politics, her sheer resilience as a woman I find really inspiring. And that book, although chunks of it were the sort of clichéd stuff that [her books] have been full of in the past, a lot of it was quite raw and authentic.”Perhaps Sturgeon is more drawn to fiction because it has the power to stimulate the imagination. The playwright Jo Clford once said: “Empathy is a muscle and theatre is the gym.”  But empathy is a quality much lacking in politics today. Could novel-reading provide a similar workout? And,  so, has it made the First Minister a better, more-compassionate leader? “It’s not for me to comment on my abilities as a politician,” she says. “But there’s no doubt it develops an empathy and understanding of people, circumstances, parts of the world periods in history,” she says. “It changes and broadens [your] perspective.”            Barr – author of Maggie and Me, a memoir about surviving Thatcher’s Britain – plans to introduce the Wigtown event by talking about other leaders’ reading preferences. When asked about his favourite book, Donald J Trump put The Art of the Deal by Donald J Trump second only to the Bible Theresa May said Pride and Prejudice . Jeremy Corbyn claims to have read Ulysses four times, though his favourite novelist is the Nigerian Chinua Achebe.Surely the world would be a better place  all politicians were required to consume more fiction? “Undoubtedly,” answers Sturgeon. “With the best will in the world nobody experiences everything and you are dealing all the time with issues that you don’t have first-hand experience of. I’m not saying reading books are a substitute for that, but they definitely allow you to understand people and situations that otherwise you might not understand.”Such is Sturgeon’s desire to pass on the pleasure of books, she started the First Minister’s Reading Challenge which has been running in primary schools since 2016 and was recently extended to secondary schools. The day before we speak, she has been visiting Renfrew High to see the work done by pupils who have produced a graphic novel.“It’s all about trying not to come at it as: ‘You must read because it helps you do well at school,’ although it does, but instead trying to encourage kids to have a love of reading for its own sake.”The book festival appearances are about supporting authors who may struggle to make a living. “I think that one of the most special, wonderful things that anyone can ever do is to write a novel that gets published and then provides enjoyment for other people. “That is also why I tweet about them. If I have got huge enjoyment reading a book, then a tiny wee thing I can do is to recommend that book and hopefully someone else will pick it up and read it.”Under-read and often corralled into genres such as crime or memoirs, female writers are often in particular need of promotion. Sturgeon says she naturally gravitates towards books written by women. “I don’t set targets,” she says, “but I think I probably do subconsciously keep a track of the breadth both in terms of gender and kind of international reach of the books I am reading.”“I think women writers are read less and reviewed a lot more harshly than men are, so I like trying to do my little bit to redress that balance.”With as-yet unread books piled high at home, and literary festivals flourishing across the country, Sturgeon guffaws at Will Self’s proclamation that the novel is dead. “I think Will Self supported independence so he is clearly right on lots of things, but on this he is just wrong,” she says. “I think the novel will outlive all of us and generations to come.”Barr is the patron of Gladstone’s Library in Hawarden in Wales. He tells me William Gladstone read a book a day covering all sorts of genres and had “lively” opinions on most of them. Then, at the age of 85, the former Liberal prime minister took his 32,000-strong book collection a quarter of a mile in a wheelbarrow to the then library building.A vocal No voter last time round  Barr says he is nevertheless proud to hail from a country where the First Minister tweets photographs of books on the Man Booker Prize long-list. “It’s unusual in the current age to find the leader of a country who is really public about and vocal about their love for books and not just generic way, but in a really specic way,” he says. “We need politicians doing more deep thinking and more deep reading, rather than just reading 140 characters in a Tweet.”The power of books to bring people together was brought home to Barr when he attended the Scribes at the Rock Festival on the Falls Road last month. “There was I standing right in front of Gerry Adams reading from [Maggie and Me] which opens with the Brighton bombing and afterwards he came up and shook my hand. He read the book and tweeted me to say how much he loved it, which was amazing.“I think  books can do that in Northern Ireland, they can do it anywhere.”Back in the First Minister’s office, my allotted half-hour is drawing to a close, but Sturgeon seems in no hurry. She is still talking animatedly about Ali Smith’s Autumn: “It captures the confusion and ision and feeling in that immediate post-Brexit period in a better way than anything else fiction or non-fiction I have read since.” And about Muriel Spark whose novels she has been re-reading in her centenary year – “I had forgotten just how sublime they are.”As I switch my tape recorder off, she strides across the room to her bookshelves and pulls out a handful of slim volumes. “Have you heard of Charco Press?” she asks. “It’s a new publishing house in Edinburgh which specialises in translated fiction from Latin America”. It occurs to me, then, that for a politician who is sometimes accused of trying to push Scots literature and language on to the curriculum, her tastes are anything but parochial.  We part having swapped recommendations. She convinces me to read The Mars Room - a Man Booker prize long-listed novel by Rachel Kushner about a woman serving le in a US jail for murdering a stalker. I hope I convince her to read Goblin by Ever Dundas. “I could go on talking about books as long as you let me,” she says as I gather up my things.

The politician, who was jailed for perjury in 2011, told the crowd he wanted the First Minister to use her mandate for a second independence referendum.            “In 2016 the Scottish Parliament elections were held and the SNP were quite clear, they sought a mandate for Indyref2 and they won it,” he said.“The Scottish Parliament voted to hold Indyref2 in September 2018 or March 2019.”He added: “We can go in March next year. Please Nicola, sound the bell. Fire the starting pistol.“Please Nicola Sturgeon, you’ve done a good job so far, put yourself at the head of this campaign ... and on the 7th of October in Glasgow’s SECC please stand up and ignite the passion across Scotland by announcing loud and clear we’re going to use the mandate.”Other speakers at the event included Western Isles SNP MP Angus MacNeil and former Scottish cabinet minister Alex Neil.            Mr Neil said: “The time has come for us to go out and evangelise how much better le would be  we make our parliament an independent parliament.”He said a “very minimum of 55%” of independence supporters was needed to ensure winning the second referendum.“I pledge myself, and I hope everyone here pledges themselves, to do everything we need to do in the next month and the next few years, to get Indyref2 and to win Indyref2.”Campaigners had planned to show the film Braveheart at the start of the rally but the screening did not go ahead.            Independence campaign group Saor Alba organised a march to the event and the group’s George Kempik said the turnout at the rally had been “disapointing”, but vowed they would continue.He said: “I have children and grandchildren, and for me this is about them. I’ve been fighting for independence since the original referendum for devolution in Scotland in 1979 and nothing I’ve seen then has ever changed my mind.“The rallies are just a reminder to everybody. They’ve got to keep happening.”Charles Archibald, 42, from Stirling, attended the rally with his family to show his support for the independence movement.He said: “It’s not going to go away, it’s never going to go away.”            : Private school tax grab will threaten teaching jobs, John Swinney warnedA: Alex Salmond ‘happy’ to talk to officers investigating sexual harassment claims        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nSaturday 15 Sep 2018 11:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

She refused to take her seat and instead sat in the First Dáil.\nSinn Féin MPs in the North continue to stand on an abstentionist ticket.\nResponding to criticism from other Fianna Fáil TDs over their continued policy of abstentionism, Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey said in March 2018:\n“We are not British MPs, we are Irish MPs and we believe the interests of the Irish people can only be served by democratic institutions on the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin goes to the electorate seeking a mandate for that position. We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit mps call for action to help northern ireland fishing fleet","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We heard pleas for increased quota and action to alleviate crewing shortages in the Northern Ireland fleet.\n\n\"The Government\u0027s fisheries white paper is a step in the right direction, but more detail is needed on how quota allocations will change. \n\n\"The industry also needs to be reassured that the Government will be ready to support them in the unlikely and undesirable event of no deal.\n\n\"The Government must now take action on Ireland\u0027s unilateral suspension of the Voisinage Arrangement and on the long-running dispute over Lough Foyle.\"\n\nThe Voisinage Arrangement allows for mutual access to Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland vessels up to six nautical miles off the coast of each country.\n\nSince Brexit there has been considerable debate between politicians on both sides of the border over who should have the right to use Lough Foyle.\n\nDr Murrison continued: \"We found an industry in Northern Ireland with great people and huge potential, but it is fragile.\n\n\"Changes to quotas and access to waters aren\u0027t enough. We must develop infrastructure to support the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, find crews for boats and enable fishing businesses to sell into Europe post Brexit.\"\n\nThe report\u0027s findings were welcomed by Alan McCulla, chief executive officer of Kilkeel-based fisherman\u0027s co-operative Sea Source Ltd and the Anglo North Ireland Food Producer\u0027s Organisation.\n\n\"It\u0027s very encouraging to see MPs very engaged and having a genuine interest in the fishing industry,\" he told the Belfast . \n\n\"Fishing is one of the few industries that has the very real potential for a tremendous idend from Brexit. We\u0027re especially pleased to see there has been a call for access to properly qualied and experienced crew.\n\n\"We\u0027ve seen an escalation in the \u0027scallop wars\u0027 between the UK and France recently, but it also has to be recognised that Dublin has been excluding Northern Ireland fishermen. The Voisinage Arrangement has been suspended in Ireland since 2016 and we need Dublin to engage on this issue and end the impasse.\n\n\"Then we need to look at infrastructure in the industry in Northern Ireland. Given the current political situation, we\u0027ve had no one here making decisions for the past 18 months at a time when major decisions need to be made. \n\n\"Brexit will happen, but there\u0027s no way we will be able to maximise the potential benefits it will bring unless we act now.\n\n\"It\u0027s ironic that the Republic of Ireland has been investing heavily in port infrastructure when they could be the losers. In Northern Ireland we are behind the game and I\u0027d encourage London to progress urgently.\"\n\nFor Mr McCulla, the only disappointment in the report is the failure to mention the Hague Preference, a mechanism designed to adjust national fish quota allocations to take account of the needs of certain fisheries-dependent areas in northern parts of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\"The existence of it was a main reason why we saw 92% of the Northern Ireland fishing industry vote to leave the EU.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mla kelly seeking answers over who tipped off photographer about howells visit to grave of father","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And from that we have to ask, why was it being kept a secret at all?\n\n\"This is a case that was of signicant public interest at the time and has been since. It\u0027s very high profile. The Department of Justice has had a few knocks over the past couple of weeks and should be taking whatever steps necessary to restore public confidence.\"\n\nHowell\u0027s father Samuel passed away on July 21 and he did not attend the funeral service, which was held at Portadown Baptist Church on July 28.\n\nA source told the Belfast  his visit to the grave lasted just over an hour and he was accompanied by prison officers.\n\nHowell is currently serving a 21-year jail term for the double murder of his we Lesley  and Trevor Buchanan , the RUC officer husband of his then lover Hazel Stewart. Their bodies were found in a fume-filled garage in Castlerock in 1991.\n\nPolice originally thought the pair had died in a suicide pact after discovering their partners were having an affair.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service declined to discuss his release, saying it \"does not comment on inidual cases\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland inquest delays 80 hearings on just","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It has had 14 preliminary hearings.\n\nIssues around legacy continue to deeply ide Northern Ireland\u0027s political parties.\n\nAlthough the Stormont House Agreement includes a £150m package to deal with all legacy issues, the Government has said financial resources will not be released until political consensus is reached on dealing with the past.\n\nThe families of those killed at Kingsmill, one of the most shocking crimes of the Troubles, have faced the greatest number of delays, with 35 preliminary hearings.\n\nRepublican terrorists stopped a minibus carrying a group of 10 Protestant textile workers, ordered them off the bus, lined them up and shot them at the roadside in January 1976.\n\nThe atrocity has been attributed to the Provisional IRA, but no one has ever been convicted over the murders. Only one man, Alan Black, survived, despite being shot 18 times. An inquest into Kingsmill was held at the time but a fresh one was ordered at the request of the Attorney General in 2013.\n\nIt opened in 2016 and has sat periodically, with a number of preliminary hearings also taking place in that time.\n\nColin Worton\u0027s brother Kenneth was among the 10 textile workers gunned down during the roadside ambush.\n\nHe said: \"Over 42 years on, we would like to have been much further ahead in our quest for justice.\" Mr Worton said his mother, Bea, who is almost 91, is also deeply distressed by the ongoing delays.\n\n\"She often wonders  she will get answers in her letime, but things only seem to be dragging on.\n\n\"At the end of the day,  any truth comes out of this it may open other doors for a conviction. However, you have to be realistic that  anyone is ever going to be convicted, they may only serve around two years in jail.\"\n\nFamilies of those killed by the Army in Ballymurphy in August 1971 have attended 22 preliminary hearings.\n\nTen people were shot during three days of gunfire involving members of the Parachute Regiment. They included a priest tending to those wounded and a mother of eight. Another man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nLast month their families expressed anger at an \"11th hour\" disclosure by the Ministry of Defence - seven days before an inquest was due to start.\n\nThe last-minute discovery of a database - documenting details of 4,733 soldiers who had been serving at the time of the 1971 shootings - delayed the latest hearings which were due to start on September 10. A new hearing date has been set for November 12.\n\nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was among those killed, says families are still hopeful of one day getting to the truth of what happened to their loved ones.\n\n\"Year on year, we are losing more and more eyewitnesses and family members, but it\u0027s down to the determination and hard work of the families that we have got to this point,\" he said. \"However, every time there\u0027s a setback, we feel the hurt.\"\n\nThe Stalker Sampson case has had 27 preliminary hearings. Six men were killed in late 1982 in three separate incidents which became the subject of the Sampson/Stalker report, carried out by two senior police officers, Colin Sampson and John Stalker.\n\nTeenager Michael Tighe was shot on November 24 IRA members Eugene Toman, Sean Burns and Gervaise McKerr were shot on November 11 and INLA members Roderick Carroll and Seamus Grew on December 12.\n\nInquests into the deaths have been delayed for many years. The Stalker/Sampson reports have never been made public.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united ireland would permanently reduce living standards of those in republic","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Within these loan books are likely to be some devoted exclusively to the exploitation of the poor.\n— Frank Field MP  \nSeptember 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe said swt action by the church would stop a new lender “terrorising” the poor and would be “an example of the jubilee in setting slaves free of their debts”.\n\nAccording to the Book of Leviticus, a jubilee year occurs every 50th year, during which slaves and prisoners are freed and debts forgiven.\n\nAdministrator Grant Thornton is running Wonga’s loan book while it looks for a buyer.\n\nMr Field said that such a purchase led by the Church of England could mark the beginning of a “people’s bank”.\n\nHe told the Press Association: “Wonga targeted people who are beyond the abyss.\n\n“This is an ambulance rescue operation, but longer term we need to look at offering long-term credit, through a people’s bank, for those who are in urgent need.”\n\nA spokesman for the Church of England said: “We are reflecting on what may or may not be possible in the months ahead regarding the repercussions following Wonga’s collapse.”\n\nIn 2013 the Archbishop was forced to admit the Church of England’s investment fund had invested indirectly in Wonga.\n\nAlthough the sum was small – about £75,000 out of investments totalling £5.5 billion – he described it as embarrassing.\n\n“It shouldn’t happen, it’s very embarrassing, but these things do happen and we have to find out why and make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Archbishop Welby said at the time.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop derry announces number clerical changes derry

lives with the help of a close friend.\n\nBob and Michelle McLaughlin daughters Saorlaith and Saoirse received le-saving care at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit , where they were looked after in 2016 after they were born prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication.\n\nThe girls arrived six weeks early and suffered from ‘Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome’ in the womb, where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.\n\nThey were nursed back to health by the staff at the Neo Natal unit and their parents have held a charity walk for the past two years to raise money to say thanks.\n\nThis year family friend Michael Kelly offered to hold a fundraising event at his tattoo parlour to help boost their donation.\n\nIt soon mushroomed into a huge family fun day at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park and rock night at the Delacroix which both took place on Saturday.\n\nMr Kelly was joined by a team of tattooist from across the north who managed to ‘ink up’ 120 people with specially designed tattoos.\n\nThose who got tattooed included parents whose children had spent time in the ward and even three members of staff.\n\nMr McLaughlin got two designs himself- a purple ribbon, which is the symbol of prematurity awareness, and a set of footprints surrounded by a heart shaped stethoscope to pay tribute to the care given to his daughters at the hospital.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot =

really excellent day,” Mr McLaughlin told the Derry News.\n\n“I couldn’t even have imagined that so many people would turn up and show their support from all over the city and beyond.\n\n“A lot of people had personal reasons for being there and personal reasons behind the tattoos that they choose.\n\n“There was one woman who got a tattoo in memory of her grand child who had sadly passed away in the NNICU, so there were a lot of really emotional stories.”\n\nAwareness\n\nMr McLaughlin thanked everyone who helped make the fundraising event such a huge success.\n\n“It means the world to us that Michael decided to do this for our family and that he and all his staff and visiting tattoo artists gave up their time for free,” he added.\n\n“It is something we will never forget. It has raised £5,347.20 for the NNICU and it has raised so much awareness as well.\n\n“Thank you also to The McConomy School of Irish dance who allowed their premises to be used for the fun day and to the dancers and bands that performed during the day, to Donna Kelly and Noleen O’Hara who baked all night for the bake sale, to the bikers and bands who took part in the Delacroix and everyone who

Rail Way will be released throughout the year to both the private and public sector for strategic economic development.\n\nMr O’Connor said there would be no loss of revenue to Council  the street food markets were held on a Sunday when car parks are operated free of charge to motorists.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new features front historic building derry hoped bring life people area","story":"\nDERRY councillors have voted to overturn a planning decision which would have seen the owners of a restaurant in the city centre banned from erecting a shelter at the front of the premises.\n\nThe application came before the September meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Planning Committee seeking approval for the installation of three external retractable awnings to part of the front façade of the Custom House building at Custom House Street in Derry, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, a planning officer said that advice had been received from the Historic Environment Division  that the installation would have an ‘adverse affect’ on a number of listed buildings within the area, including Custom House, the Harbour Commissioners Office, Harbour Square and The Guildhall.\n\nThe meeting was told that the HED were of the opinion that the proposal would result in ‘unnecessary damage’ to the historic structure. \n\nThe officer added that while the plans before them had been amended from a previous application, the awnings would still ‘obscure the windows to a certain extent and remain inappropriate on a building of this style and character’.\n\nThe meeting head that a precedent had been set by the nearby Guildhall Taphouse bar, formerly the Monico Bar, another listed building which mow has an awning over a seated area.\n\nHowever, the Historic Environment Division said the building was ‘of a dferent style’.\n\nThe planning officer advised local councillors refuse the application on grounds that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’ as it would have an adverse effect on the character of Custom House and the setting of the surrounding listed buildings.\n\nThe meeting then heard from a representative of the applicant, Kular Fashions, who said that the contractor chosen to carry out the work are the ‘best in the UK’ and would carry out the work in a ‘delicate’ manner which would have ‘no impact on the structure itself’.\n\nHe added that the awning would bring ‘le and people’ into the space and said buildings are ‘not antiques’ and should be ‘inhabitable’ whether it is sunny or raining.\n\n\n\n

 .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe applicant also assured councillors that the awning would not contain any advertising.\n\nDUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said there are a ‘strong trio’ of buildings in the area and she didn’t want to interfere with their architectural integrity.\n\nCouncillor Dan Kelly, of Sinn Féin, said the awnings would provide shelter for street entertainment and believed that tables on the streets was part of the ‘direction of travel’ in the city. \n\nHead of Planning with council, Maura Fox, said it is a ‘balancing act’ and she was ‘very much in favour of retaining listed buildings’. \n\nSDLP councillor Tina Gardiner said she would be supportive of the awning  it was ‘tasteful’ and made reference to their widespread use on historic buildings in London. \n\nUsing the Guildhall Taphouse as an example, she said it made the space visible and attracts ‘le and vitality’.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Féin Cllr Patricia Logue said, the buildings may become ‘vacant and derelict’, but agreed that they should contain ‘no advertising’. \n\nHowever, the SDLP’s Gus Hastings believed awnings didn’t serve much purpose and would only encourage ‘outside smoking’ and therefore wouldn’t be supporting it.\n\nEleven councillors voted in favour of the awnings and two against, meaning the advice of planning officers was ‘overturned’.\n\nThe meeting was told that the matter would come back before the council next month.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"voice people north needs heard european parliament post

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily.

Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick. Devlin and Marty Robinson swapped scores, but it was Downpatrick who took an unlikely lead when Garrett Trainor, who was proving to be an effective target man at full forward when the ball did get into him, plucked the ball out of the air, turned and pointed the Hoops into a 0-3 to 0-2 lead after 14 minutes.\n\nAlas, this was to be their last score of the half as Kilcoo brought their A game to the party.\n\nUnanswered points from Doherty and Paul Devlin  eased the Magpies into a 0-6 to 0-3 lead by the break.\n\nConor McGrady and Doherty exchanged points at the start of the second half before Doherty swooped to send Kilcoo into a 1-7 to 0-4 lead with a clinical strike that caught Downpatrick flat-footed.\n\nMagee and Doherty swapped points before the former left five points in it with another converted free, but Kilcoo were lying in wait and with 42 minutes gone Ryan Johnston finished a mesmeric run with an explosive finish to put his side 2-8 to 0-6 clear.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nKilcoo were now in the zone and points from Jerome Johnston, Paul Devlin , Marty Devlin and Doherty put the issue beyond Downpatrick, 2-14 to 0-6.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Hoops, to their credit, never gave up and points from Owen McEvoy, Magee  and Rory Quinn put a bit of respectability on the final score.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nKilcoo: N Kane, Patrick Devlin, Aidan Branagan, N Branagan, M Rooney, D Branagan, Aaron Branagan, J McClean, Paul Devlin , Cillian Laverty, C Doherty , J Johnston , M Devlin , J J McLaughlin, Conor Laverty.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Inquiry has been told.\n\n                \nReturning to the public inquiry for a sixth and final day of questioning, Andrew Crawford – the man who was at Arlene Foster’s side for almost all of her ministerial career – faced an intensely forensic examination of his conduct.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nYesterday the inquiry focussed on the DUP man’s deep and extensive contacts with Northern Ireland’s monopoly poultry processor, Moy Park – including the fact that three of his close family members who sell to Moy Park have between them 11 boilers.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Crawford admitted that by mid-2015 “I knew there was nothing to stop people running boilers 24/7 and getting paid for it...I could see how people could do that”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHowever, he said he had “no knowledge” of actual abuse happening.\n\nDr Crawford has denied the allegation of fellow former DUP Spad Tim Cairns that he acted in the background to delay cost controls in the summer of 2015, at a point when the scheme was already known to be beyond its budget.\n\nCentral to Dr Crawford’s defence is an email which he sent to Mr Cairns on July 31.\n\nIt began: “I think that you will have to make changes from the 1st October as the system at the moment has no upper limit to the amount of support.” \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHowever, the inquiry has revealed how the proposal which Dr Crawford then went on to make in that email as to what should happen on October 1 would have meant that many of the heaviest RHI users would have barely,  at all, worse off even after the scheme was changed in the way he suggested.\n\nThe inquiry’s technical assessor, energy expert Dr Keith MacLean, put it to Dr Crawford that his proposal to allow RHI boiler owners to double the size of boilers eligible for the most lucrative tarf under the proposed cost controls, and then to increase the number of hours which they could claim that top rate from 1,314 hours to 3,000 hours, meant that his proposal would not have reined in the out of control scheme.\n\nHe said: “On the basis of fairly simple arithmetic, it seems that what you’re proposing is actually a way of maintaining exactly the same income for the poultry industry that they were having before because what you’re saying is that currently there are 99kw boilers that they’re running for 6,000 hours but under the new regime, because the band is being doubled up to 199kw, they would then run for half the hours.”\n\nHe said the proposal would mean that they “would therefore maintain exactly the high income that was driving the behaviour that you have described that allows them to heat houses when they’re empty. Was that your conscious motivation for putting forward that?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe DUP man said that he was not saying that his proposal was “sound”, based on what he now knows, but that “there was a clear rationale” for it.\n\nHe said that he met boiler installer David Robinson in a chance encounter on the farm of his brother who was installing boilers, and was told that an average poultry house requires 16 hours of heat a day and that he had based his calculations on that number.\n\nHe said that he believed his proposal would “stop the rush of people coming in before the changes were taking place”.\n\nDr MacLean said: “Of course you would –  you give them just as much money as before.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What you would be doing is stopping people then running the boilers 24/7.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt that point, inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin intervened. He said: “What this is is a sales pitch for Moy Park.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, it’s not. I don’t believe so.”\n\nSir Patrick cut him off, saying: “Hold on. Let’s read it: ‘If a Moy Park producer puts in a 199kw boiler, he can expect to run it for 3,000 hours’.”\n\nThe retired judge went on: “We’ve already got the warning before that some people are running boilers [in] empty sheds for 6,000 hours.\n\n“But this is for Moy Park – not for that [abuse]. ‘From these calculations you will see that Moy Park producers will be in a rush to refit their houses. If you increase the step from 1,314 to 3,000...’ Why 3,000? Because 3,000 is what Moy Park need. Now, unless you have, Dr Crawford, a really helpful reasoned explanation, that is what you have put in English in your email.”\n\nDr Crawford replied: “In terms of what [was in the email], it’s not my knowledge at that time [was that] it took the 3,000 hours to heat a house – not to heat it when it’s empty it’s to heat it when there’s a crop in the house.”\n\nWith obvious exasperation, Sir Patrick interjected: “Exactly. But that’s what Moy Park need or want or told you.”\n\nDr Crawford said that the previous night he got an email which talked about poultry having the highest heat need and he recalled the conversation with the boiler installer.\n\nSir Patrick put it to him: “You’re the man who originally recommended setting up a meeting with Moy Park you’re the man with the relations, all of whom worked for Moy Park in this email of yours Moy Park are the only people who are identied as requiring 3,000 hours. \n\n“Now, it’s a simple proposition: What you’re saying in this is...we have to stick by 1st October...there is nothing in there that doesn’t refer to the 3,000 hours being attributable to Moy Park’s needs.”\n\nThe DUP man said: “I believe  I had spoken to Moy Park, I would probably have came [sic] back with a figure that was below that...it goes back to: What is possible to get this through the [Assembly] committee?”\n\nSir Patrick said that the ministerial submission passed to him talked about putting in a limit of 1,314 hours, the same as in GB. He said: “What you’re saying here is: There is a special interest here, and that is the poultry interest, and Moy Park need 3,000 hours.”\n\nDr Crawford said: “What I was doing was putting a proposal on the table – or not even a proposal, a suggestion on the table – to try and allay Timothy Cairns’s concerns so that he could get the submission through.”\n\nSir Patrick asked: “Or for the benefit of the industry?” \n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, it’s what was the art of the possible...”\n\nDr MacLean said the panel was not disagreeing with him that his proposal would have made it much easier to get acceptance of the cost controls “because a big group that would object and would lobby MLAs would be perfectly happy with it” and there would be no spike in applications because “by giving them all the extra money and keeping the level of the money as it was before there would be no reason to rush to get into it”.\n\nDr Crawford then argued that his proposal would have stopped the extreme abuse of the scheme because those running boilers around the clock would no longer have an incentive to do so.\n\nSir Patrick said: “All right. Why not go for the limit suggested [from GB]?” The DUP man replied: “Because it goes back to the first two points that Dr Maclean was making...”\n\nWith an exasperated laugh, Sir Patrick interjected: “Because you wanted to sell it to the poultry...”\n\nDr Crawford said: “No, no. I didn’t want to sell it to the poultry industry. I wanted to make sure it could be delivered through the committee.”\n\nIn January 2017, internal Moy Park emails show that the company was tipped off by Andrew Crawford that RHI was to be shut – prompting the company to rush to install as many boilers as possible, and giving it a head-start on rivals.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting where he alerted the company to the looming change, Dr Crawford was vague, saying he did not clearly recall what had happened and suggested it may have been a passing reference to coming changes.\n\nThe meeting occured just after he became Spad to the then-finance minister Mervyn Storey, but the meeting was not in the ministerial diary and there are no minutes.\n\nSubsequently, senior Moy Park figures internally discussed how to rush through as many applications as possible how they could look at “any influence we can exert” to “soften” the proposed closure. One suggested they should “go up and see Dr Crawford”.\n\nInquiry counsel Joseph Aiken asked yesterday: “Did they come and see you?” Dr Crawford said: “I don’t recall”\n\nHe said he could not be sure and added: “I would have met Mike Mullen and other people from Moy Park on a frequent on a fairly regular basis.”\n\nAround that time, Dr Crawford and Moy Park again feature in the story.\n\nThe DUP man admitted that he deliberately removed from a crucial document which went to Executive ministers a reference to the fact that the poultry industry had driven the spike in RHI applications.\n\nThe submission was part of the Executive’s urgent procedure to close the scheme completely in February 2016 and Dr Crawford’s actions meant that the information going to other ministers was incomplete.\n\nWhen asked why he took it out, Dr Crawford admitted that the information “is accurate” but said it “wasn’t solely the poultry industry” responsible for the spike.\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked Dr Crawford to “think carefully... about any inference that the panel should draw in relation to your removal of this entry, given your family circumstances and your frequent talks to Mr Mark of Moy Park”.\n\nDr Crawford disputed that he had “frequent” talks with Mr Mark and said “it is not in relation to any inference in relation to my family”, adding that as a former DETI Spad he had a role in encouraging Moy Park’s growth.\n\nHe went on to say that “singling out Moy Park”, before correcting himself to say “the poultry industry, sorry”, was something that was “unfair”.\n\nSir Patrick said it was “undoubtedly true” that Moy Park had a key role in the spike and asked: “Why remove a true fact?”\n\nDr Crawford said “it was the inference that was being created at that time”.\n\nSir Patrick said: “It’s not an inference. That’s what I’m trying to get at with you. The major responsibility for the spike was the poultry industry, and Moy Park in particular. If that was true – and it was – why remove something that was true?”\n\nDr Crawford said: “My concern was the narrative that it was creating.”\n\nUnder intense questioning about his actions and motives, Sir Patrick eventually said: “All I’m trying to do, Dr Crawford, is trying to give you the fullest opportunity to explain something that I think you are unable to explain otherwise.”\n\nDr Crawford said he had “concern about the wider implications for the sector – the sector that employed a large number of people in Northern Ireland” – but insisted there was “no malice” in what he did.\n\nDr MacLean highlighted that it contradicted an earlier warning from Dr Crawford that a “tsunami” of applications was going to come because of Moy Park.\n\n\u0026gt\u0026gt\u0026gt Andrew Crawford is a crucial witness and over the course of six days, he faced rigorous questioning – made more rigorous because he repeatedly said “I cannot recall”, “I’m at a loss to know how that conversation went”, “I don’t know”, “I can’t say” and similar phrases, writes Sam McBride\n\nThe DUP man was unable to explain his role in many key developments in which he was, or is alleged to have been, involved.\n\nAs well as Dr Crawford’s signicance to the inquiry’s search for the truth about what happened with RHI, there is also a political signicance to what has emerged about how he acted.\n\nArlene Foster appointed Dr Crawford to a role where he had delegated authority, acting on behalf of the minister, and therefore she is accountable for his conduct.\n\nHis fate will impact on her own.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

of Gliders in east Belfast compared to buses.\n\n                \nMy analysis found that between 8am and 9am the number of seats on offer between Knock and the city centre had plunged from around 900 to around 400.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe overall capacity was down a bit too, from around 1,100 to around 1,000. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Gliders have much more standing room than the old double deckers, hence the way in which seating provision is radically down but total capacity is only slightly down. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThis means that hundreds of people every day are standing for long periods when previously they sat all the way in and all the way home.\n\nTranslink and its defenders point out that standing was always going to be a feature of the Gliders, because it is a rapid transit system. But there is a huge flaw in this logic.  \n\nPassengers are now standing at rush hour from, usually, somewhere between Stormont and Knock all the way into the city. From there it still takes about 30 more minutes to get into the centre.\n\nSo that is like the London Tube you might think? It is often so crammed that it has to leave passengers at a station until the next one comes. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut the Tube has a huge In-Out ‘churn’. It might be full for three stops then largely empty, then fill up again. Seats keep coming free.\n\nThe Glider is not like that. Once it fills up heading into Belfast, very few people get off.\n\nThus, as one furious reader wrote this week, people are routinely standing for 30 mins, never having stood on the route before. \n\nSometimes in London you have to stand 30+ mins. Sometimes. On some routes at some times, often.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut London is a mega city. Belfast is not.\n\n\n• Ben Lowry  is News Letter deputy editor\n\n\nBen Lowry Sep 14: \n\n\nCrammed Glider service in east Belfast has far, far fewer peak-time seats than the old buses did\n\n\n\nBen

mathematics professor at Oxford University, the Co Armagh man has made a name for himself off-campus by taking on some leading atheist figures in public head-to-head debates,  expounding and justying his own Christian faith.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

Christopher Hitchins in the past, and has now entered the fray with Florida State University academic Professor Michael Ruse.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThey met before a live audience in London on July 18, and the debate was then posted on video-sharing website YouTube on September 7. Since then it has been watched about 18,000 times – and here the News Letter takes a look at the spirited-but-civil clash.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCentral to Prof Lennox worldview is this: “Faith is part and parcel of my le as an intellectual and a scientist. And my Christian faith consists, not in faith as a leap into the unknown, it is evidence-based commitment.”\n\nQuoting fellow Ulster intellectual CS Lewis, Lennox said: “Men became scientic because they expected law in nature. And they expected law in nature because they believed in a law-giver.”\n\n\n   \n                  with \u0027Prof Michael Ruse  and compere Justin Brierley\" title=\"Prof John Lennox  with \u0027Prof

/\n                   \t\n      \t\t\nProf John Lennox  with \u0027Prof Michael Ruse  and compere Justin Brierley\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nRuse agreed the scientic revolution owes much to the men of Christian faith who largely drove it, noting that 16th and 17th centuries thinkers looked on the world as a “machine made by the ine engineer” as they sought to unravel it. But as time went on scientists “retired” God, dropping Him from consideration.\n\nBirmingham-born Prof Ruse’s backround is Quakerism, but he began to lose faith at around age 21 and today tends towards agnosticism.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRuse said  the universe was indeed designed, then “you have some questions to ask about the designer”.\n\nHe said: “I can’t believe that any God who cared a bit about human beings would have invented a world which allows haemorrhoids,” he said.\n\n\n   \n

/\n                   \t\n      \t\t\nProf Michael Ruse \n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nAnd turning to the question of morality, Ruse asked about the existence of evil – why, for example, was it more important to allow Heinrich Himmler his free will than to save the le of Anne Frank?\n\nLennox agreed the question of evil is an extremely hard one, but said atheism has no good answer. Because whilst it might offer a form of explanation – that the universe is just pitiless, with no justice, and that’s all – it offers no solution for “the suffering and the pain”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’d sit where you sit Michael,  I didn’t believe in the final judgement,” he said.\n\n“I don’t think Himmler is going to get away with it... and when we see what God eventually does with the Anne Franks of this world, we mightn’t have such severe questions.”\n\nThe crucixion of Christ shows that “God hasn’t remained distant from this problem”, and offers us “grounds for hope” he said.\n\nAt another point, he also declared that he believes literally in Gospel miracles such as water into wine.\n\n“I don’t believe it broke the laws of nature,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“This is God feeding a new event in – the laws of nature can’t say anything to that.”\n\nRuse said: “I just feel John that you’re reducing the Gospels to the level of Grimm’s fairytales. Let me be rather rude about this – I think you’re downgrading a tremendously important story to one of David Copperfield.”\n\nDespite his academic focus upon reason and evidence, at one point Lennox cautioned against the “dangerously false” idea that “science is the only way to truth”.\n\nHe also cited the experience he and others have had of testing what  Christ has promised in their own personal lives  – namely peace and a “new power” – and finding that it passed the test for them.\n\nCompering the event was Christian radio host Justin  Brierley, who spoke to the News Letter afterwards.\n\nAs to who won the debate, he said: “We didn’t do a vote to see where the audience felt the best arguments lay.\n\n“Possibly it might be fair to say the atmosphere in the room felt like probably they were more favourable in the end to John Lennox’s view.”\n\nThe debate was part of a series organised by Premier Christian Radio called ‘The Big Conversation’.\n\nIt has also included figures such as Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, Anglican minister and radio/TV presenter Richard Coles, Australian philosopher Peter Singer, and illusionist Derren Brown.\n\nTo watch to the
