It was gloomy\u0027.Another said: \u0027We\u0027re still far from an agreement. There\u0027s no text on the table. If there\u0027s some progress. The point is always the same: how to phrase the backstop in a way that could be acceptable for the UK.\u0027          The EU has warned Theresa May (pictured leaving No 10 tomorrow) she must offer \u0027acceptable\u0027 new ideas within 48 hours if she wants to salvage talks on the Brexit dealBrussels has now told Theresa May she has 48 hours to save her Brexit deal, which faces a catastrophic defeat in the Commons next week. There are growing rumours that the Prime Minister could fly to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker before Monday to force a breakthrough - but is unlikely to travel unless she is sure of a positive result.Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois told ITV\u0027s Peston show last night: \u0027The rumors today are that Cox has got nothing. It looks like they haven\u0027t asked for an end date. It looks like they\u0027re talking about some extremely convoluted arbitration procedure, which is probably going to be unconvincing. If it is unconvincing, then I believe that the ERG overwhelmingly will vote against it, because it means we wouldn\u0027t leave the EU\u0027.Senior Tories are said to have told the Prime Minister and Mr Cox they need to bring something new to the table to win over Brexiteers and Labour rebels.But Mrs May is still expected to lose by up 100 votes without any kind breakthrough.One source told The Sun: \u0027If we lose on Tuesday, absolutely everything is going to be s***. I cannot see how we go forward with whatever softer Brexit that gets imposed on us without the party splitting in two. It will be a complete disaster.\u0027 Another told the FT: \u0027If we lose the vote on March 12, we lose control\u0027.Labour has already promised to back a second referendum and last night Jeremy Corbyn met with Tory remainers who are campaigning for the softest possible Brexit.          With just five days until the crunch vote on May\u0027s Brexit deal, estimates suggest Mrs May is well short of the votes needed to win on Tuesday Tory sources have said that a Norway-style Brexit would cause such turmoil in the party that it could split in two.This ramps up even more pressure on the Prime Minister and the Attorney General to secure some kind of legally binding change to her Brexit deal from the EU.But insiders on both sides have given inside contrasting accounts as talks floundered. British sources have said that Michel Barnier would not be flexible as talks entered the 11th hour.A No 10 source told The Sun: \u0027We made what we thought were some pretty reasonable proposals on Tuesday night. Barnier just didn\u0027t want to engage. The EU has privately pushed back and said the UK is still yet to offer \u0027anything new\u0027 and said: \u0027What Britain is asking for goes way beyond where Barnier can go. It doesn\u0027t look we\u0027re going to bridge the gap any time soon\u0027.Britain has been given until the end of Friday to come forward with fresh proposals to break the Brexit deadlock.EU officials have said they are ready to work through the weekend if the UK comes forward with an \u0027acceptable\u0027 plan to resolve the impasse over the Northern Ireland backstop, the BBC reported.Theresa May is facing a crunch Commons vote on Tuesday when she takes her Brexit deal back to MPs following its overwhelming rejection in January by a majority of 230.          The latest row over the backstop – designed to prevent a hard border emerging in Ireland – centres around disagreements over language which could either form a new document to be added to the Withdrawal Treaty or sit alongside it, said to be taken from a letter written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker (pictured)The Prime Minister has staked her hopes of getting through the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 this time on securing concessions from the EU on the backstop - which has proved the main stumbling block to an agreement.Tory Brexiteers have been demanding legally-binding assurances the UK cannot be tied indefinitely to EU rules through the backstop, intended to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.However, talks in Brussels on Tuesday between the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay broke up without agreement.Both sides acknowledged that the meeting had been \u0027difficult\u0027, with reports Mr Barnier complained that Mr Cox had brought forward \u0027a legal solution to a political problem\u0027.Answering MPs\u0027 questions in the Commons, Mr Cox said discussions with the EU would now \u0027almost certainly\u0027 carry on over the weekend and he dismissed suggestions the Government had failed to come forward with clear proposals.\u0027We are discussing text with the European Union. I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day and we are continuing to discuss them,\u0027 he said.Chancellor Philip Hammond warned Tory Brexiteers against voting down Mrs May\u0027s deal next week, saying rejecting it would lead to a delay to Brexit.\u0027If the Prime Minister\u0027s deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.\u0027For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don\u0027t get this deal through on Tuesday.\u0027The Chancellor said he believed MPs would not support leaving the EU without a deal, but refused to be drawn on how he would vote if MPs are asked whether they want to delay Britain\u0027s withdrawal.\u0027I\u0027m not going to speculate about something that hasn\u0027t happened and I don\u0027t think will happen because I think the Government is very clear where the will of Parliament is on this,\u0027 he said.\u0027Parliament will vote not to leave the European Union without a deal next Wednesday, I have a high degree of confidence about that.\u0027Meanwhile, French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened, and that it represented \u0027best possible solution\u0027.11th hour Brexit talks collapse after bitter clash between Geoffrey Cox and Brussels\u0027 Michel Barnier leaving Tories fearing \u0027party meltdown\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"I didnt know going R Kelly 52 went bank time three weeks ago","story":"\u0027They sold them to me\u0027: R.

Kelly, where seven women made allegations against him.  "},{"url":null,"title":"With just five days crunch vote analysis reveals PM staring defeat face","story":"      The EU has warned Theresa May (pictured leaving No 10 tomorrow) she must offer \u0027acceptable\u0027 new ideas within 48 hours if she wants to salvage talks on the Brexit deal, which faces a potentially fatal defeatDesperate Geoffrey Cox claims the backstop would breach the...Brexiteers warn May they will crush her orce plan AGAIN...\u0027There\u0027s no light at the end of the tunnel\u0027: How frosty EU...Share this article  Philip Hammond (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) warned Brexiteers voting for Theresa May\u0027s deal on Tuesday is the \u0027last chance\u0027 to leave the EU on time today            The latest row over the backstop – designed to prevent a hard border emerging in Ireland – centres around disagreements over language which could either form a new document to be added to the Withdrawal Treaty or sit alongside it, said to be taken from a letter written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker (pictured)Leaving Neverland: \u0027He was larger than life and then he likes you\u0027Dancer alleges even though Jackson was kind there was abuseShocking moment man slaps his wife in the face during weddingIs this the right way?

Dame Kelly was responding to a tweet by Good Morning Britain in support of Martina Navratilova who had suggested that trans women who competed in women\u0027s sports were \u0027cheating\u0027 because of a biological advantage          Trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon calls out Holmes\u0027 sponsors Garmin and Specialized for supporting and suggests they drop her for not holding the same values          McKinnon, who also has academic pursuits, is one of a few transgender world champions across the sporting world. She achieved a 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling gold medal at a competition in Los AngelesShe wrote on Twitter: ‘So hey Specialized and Garmin have you been following how your athlete Kelly Holmes has been extremely transphobic lately on Twitter?’ She added: ‘Specialized, you have a trans athlete. Garmin, you cool with this?’Miss McKinnon urged the companies to ‘take a stand’ as Dame Kelly was ‘trying to ban trans women from competing in women’s sport’ in breach of International Olympic Committee (IOC) policy.Miss McKinnon has argued that since IOC rules introduced in 2003 allowed trans women to compete, ‘not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal’.           Holmes responded to the criticism by saying she felt strongly about competitive sports, and wanted evidence there was no disadvantage before she would back downCycling specialists Specialized said it would investigate Dame Kelly’s comments, posting on Twitter: ‘Thanks for flagging this, Rachel. This is not representative of our brand values.’Dame Kelly, who won gold in the 800m and 1,500m running events in the 2004 Olympics, hit back – telling Miss McKinnon that involving her sponsors was ‘going about this in the wrong way’. In a tweet, she questioned why she had been blocked by a fellow athlete ‘if this subject is open to debate’.She added: ‘Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous – far from it. I have an opinion you don’t like... that’s that!’ Dame Kelly has lent her support to the Fair Play for Women campaign, which insists that female athletes are at a clear disadvantage against trans rivals.Tennis star Miss Navratilova has already clashed with Miss McKinnon in a row over male-born transgender athletes competing against biological women, branding it ‘cheating’.The Wimbledon champion and LGBT campaigner deplored the ‘tyranny’ of transgender activists who ‘denounce anyone who argues against them’.Miss Navratilova – who faced abuse and prejudice after coming out as gay in 1981 – accused Canadian Miss McKinnon of sending ‘bullying tweets’, and said her views had now ‘strengthened’.Long distance runner Miss Radcliffe has said tighter rules need to be applied if transgender women are to compete. IOC guidelines say transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for at least 12 months before they compete.She told the BBC: ‘People will manipulate this if there is an opening there to make money and win medals and we’ve seen the lengths people go to, the lengths Russia went to cheat in sport.’    Sharron Davies says the argument about trans women competing in female events is simply a matter of ‘biology’.The former Olympic swimmer, 56, claimed it was unfair to compete against those ‘who were born into a male body with all the advantages that will bring’.She told Radio 4’s Today programme that simple biology meant a transgender competitor would have a better ‘red blood cell count, increased lung capacity, better hand-eye co-ordination, longer limbs, denser bones, leaner muscle, bigger hearts’. Miss Davies, pictured, added: ‘Take swimming. Michael Phelps has got size 15 feet, your average female has size five or six feet, so if we were to move a man into swimming they would totally dominate all the women’s events.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Highly educated middle class women marry down","story":"    English language teacher Catharine Higginson, 49, is married to James, 47, who runs a small-scale construction companyOn the surface we\u0027re worlds apart.

We went to New York, Iceland, Holland, Canada.In 2008 I was made redundant. Suddenly I was at home all day and depression swooped in. My ex travelled for work and I felt he wasn\u0027t very sympathetic when he came home. Turning 30 was a wake-up call for me. I realised I wanted to spend my working days doing something that mattered. My ex couldn\u0027t fathom my thinking and our marriage failed.Six years ago when I was 31 I moved to London to make a fresh start. I worked as a Spanish tutor to pay my way through my PGCE.It was then I met my husband Sami. He\u0027d put an ad on a website looking for like-minded single people to go travelling with. He was working as a cleaner for a company renting apartments.I didn\u0027t have many friends in London, so thought, \u0027why not\u0027. We travelled around Europe. Needless to say we didn\u0027t stay in smart hotels. Within three months we were dating. Sami proposed five months later. My family met him with an open mind, but they did challenge me about his suitability, demanding to know how on earth he\u0027d earn enough money to support me if I ever lost my job again.Sami won my parents over by cooking for them.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, pictured, could return to Brussels as early as today if officials indicate there is the prospect of a breakthroughSome Labour MPs have also suggested that they could vote for it following concessions by Mrs May on protections for workers\u0027 rights after Brexit and a £1.6billion fund for towns in the North that have been \u0027left behind\u0027.But senior Tories admit that opposition to the deal has hardened, and fear it is set for a second heavy defeat unless there is a breakthrough in Brussels.If it is defeated, Mrs May has promised to hold votes in the following days on whether to pursue No Deal on March 29 or ask the EU to delay Brexit.Allowing Tory MPs to vote against Government policy on the two issues will embarrass the Prime Minister and anger Eurosceptic MPs. But allies believe it will be less damaging than resignations caused by trying to order MPs to vote for or against No Deal.Cabinet ministers, including Mr Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark, are also urging the PM to then hold \u0027indicative votes\u0027 on softer Brexit options, such as a customs union or a Norway-style deal, to find a consensus.A cross-party group of MPs has already warned it will try to seize control of Brexit if the Prime Minister\u0027s deal is defeated. Former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin said MPs would try to hold indicative votes on March 19 in the hope of finding a consensus.Mr Hammond warned pro-Brexit MPs they risked a softer Brexit if they joined forces with Labour to defeat Mrs May\u0027s deal. He said: \u0027If the deal does not get approved, it is likely the Commons will vote to extend Article 50, to not leave the EU without a deal.

File photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireOne of the striking things about today’s Ipsos MRBI poll findings is the degree to which views in Northern Ireland on Brexit and the political management of it at Westminster cross the community ide.It is not, for example, surprising that a strong majority (85 per cent) of voters from a Catholic background disapprove of the way Theresa May’s government is running the UK. But what is striking is that 72 per cent of voters from a Protestant background agree.This shared view – consensus is perhaps too strong a word – extends across several of the questions about their political leaders and Brexit options that Northern voters were asked in today’s poll.Asked if they believed that DUP MPs – who are allied with Conservative hard Brexiteer MPs – were “doing a good job or a bad job representing Northern Ireland at Westminster”, a whopping two-thirds of voters (67 per cent) said they were doing a bad job. Among voters from a Catholic background, the number was 83 per cent. But among those from a Protestant background, it was still an absolute majority – 52 per cent, against 34 per cent who said they were doing a good job.On Arlene Foster’s performance, 82 per cent of voters from a Catholic background said they were dissatisfied with her performance but so did 57 per cent of voters from a Protestant background.There is – by Northern Ireland standards, at any rate – a high degree of cross-community agreement on Brexit: Northern Ireland is united (more or less) in preferring the softest of soft Brexits.Asked if they wanted all of the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union to ensure no hard border and no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, two-thirds – 67 per cent – of voters agree, against just 17 per cent who disagree.Broken down by community background, 52 per cent of those from a Protestant background agree, 81 per cent from a Catholic background agree, 83 per cent of those from another background and 65 per cent of those who gave no background also agreed.In the case of a hard Brexit, more Northern voters prefer checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, than favour checks on the border.Asked if they want Northern Ireland to leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK even if it meant checks on the border, almost half of voters (48 per cent) disagree, with 35 per cent agreeing.But asked if they want special arrangements for Northern Ireland to avoid border checks – even if it means checks on goods moving to the UK – 60 per cent of respondents agree, with 21 per cent disagreeing.ContradictionsInevitably, there are some complications and contradictions in people’s views: that’s hardly surprising. Some 54 per cent of voters from a Protestant background want to leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK, even if this means border checks, while 51 per cent say they prefer checks between Northern Ireland and the UK over checks on the border.However, taken across the range of questions, it seems clear that the strong desire of people in Northern Ireland, evident in both communities, is for a soft Brexit, with no hard border, no checks on goods and the minimum of disruption.Translate this into politics: it’s clear from today’s numbers that the Brexit line being pursued by the DUP is significantly at odds not just with the Northern Irish electorate as a whole, but it is also at odds with the views of the Protestant and unionist communities from which the party draws its support.Among those communities, it’s clear that that many of them are okay with the idea that some east-west trade friction is consistent with remaining in the UK. Voters from a Protestant background are entirely committed to remaining in the UK – and in favour of a soft Brexit. And in the event of a hard Brexit, they favour avoiding friction on the border with the Republic.Another way of putting this: Brexit is about Brexit, not about unionism vs nationalism.It’s not, of course, clear if that knowledge will prompt any rethink among the DUP’s leadership. But no politician wants to cut himself, or herself off from their base."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3818429.1552002205!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karen bradley refuses to resign is deeply sorry for remarks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of state for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley said she wants to ‘deliver justice’ for families hurt by what she said. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has refused calls for her to stand down and said she considers her role “one of the greatest honours in Government”.“The fewer than 10 per cent that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way.”Relatives of people who died in the Troubles and politicians in the North and State condemned her remarks.Ms Bradley said she is “deeply sorry” for the “offence and hurt” caused after she said deaths caused by soldiers and police during the Troubles were not crimes.Speaking to the BBC’s The View programme on Thursday, Ms Bradley said she had “said the wrong thing”.When asked about whether she would resign, she said she was determined to deliver for people in Northern Ireland.“I want to apologise to everybody who has been hurt, distressed by what I said. It was wrong. I should not have said it. What I want to do now is deliver for those families from all parts of the community who have been so deeply affected by the Troubles because I know how raw that pain is,” she said.‘Corrected the record’Ms Bradley said there were “no excuses” for what she said in the House of Commons on Wednesday: “It’s not what I think, it’s not what I mean. I said something in response to an oral question and as soon as I realised what I had said I corrected the record,” she said.When asked if she will apologise formally in the House of Commons, she said she has already corrected the record in the House and apologised for her comments outside.“I am determined that those families who have been hurt by what I said will see justice,” she added.Northern Ireland’s former police ombudsman Baroness Nuala O’Loan urged British prime minister Theresa May to seek Ms Bradley’s resignation.Baroness O’Loan said Ms Bradley’s remarks demonstrated ignorance of Northern Ireland’s history and that she had no credible future as secretary of state.Responding to Baroness O’Loan’s remarks, Ms Bradley said she is working “incredibly hard” for the people of Northern Ireland and would continue to do so.“I’ve worked tirelessly since I was appointed to what I consider one of the greatest honours in Government – to be Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I am determined we will restore devolution and we will deliver,” she said.“I’m responsible for dealing with the legacy of the Troubles and I’m determined we will do so.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersFileGeoffrey Cox was back in the House of Commons on Thursday for a mid-morning performance that owed as much to his am-dram experience in the Cambridge Footlights as to his years at the Old Bailey.The attorney general had little to boast about after a disastrous dinner in Brussels with Michel Barnier’s negotiating team, which left EU officials dismissing Britain’s latest proposals as “insane”.But Cox was in crowd-pleasing form, making a virtue of a disparaging term used by hardline Brexiteers to describe the concession he was seeking so that he could change his legal advice on the Northern Ireland backstop.“It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop that will cause me to review and change my advice. That is government policy that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order,” he said.Theresa May’s hopes of winning a majority for her Brexit deal next Tuesday rest on persuading the DUP and hardline Conservative Brexiteers that Britain cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.Downing Street perceives the DUP as the key to unlocking the support of all but a handful of diehard eurosceptics on the Conservative backbenches.The EU has ruled out a time limit or a unilateral withdrawal mechanism and Cox’s efforts are now focused on an arbitration mechanism to determine when the backstop can end.Minimising frictionDUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Wednesday that arbitration was unacceptable and that only Britain’s sovereign parliament and government should be allowed to determine how long the backstop lasts.Others in his party believe that arbitration could offer a way out of the backstop but that its effectiveness depends, as Cox told MPs on Thursday, on the question the arbitrator is asked.Cox told EU negotiators this week that instead of determining if both parties are acting in good faith, arbitrators should be asked if Britain had made reasonable efforts to find an alternative to the backstop.If the answer was yes, Britain should be allowed to replace the backstop – which would see the whole of the UK remain in a customs arrangement with the EU and Northern Ireland following some single market rules – with a “mini-backstop” that would seek to minimise friction on the Border.Cox will return to Brussels on Friday for talks that are expected to continue through the weekend. But the two sides are so far apart that it now appears unlikely that the attorney general will secure the changes he needs to change his legal advice and persuade the DUP to vote for the Brexit deal.The prime minister has promised to bring the deal back to the Commons by next Tuesday for a “meaningful vote” and that its defeat would be followed on Wednesday and Thursday by votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.Alternative offerIf a defeat on Tuesday is unavoidable, the government could offer MPs an additional vote similar to January’s Brady amendment which said the House would support the withdrawal agreement if the backstop was replaced with alternative arrangements to keep the Border open.If May wins a majority for an amendment outlining Cox’s arbitration proposal, she will still have to face votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension. But she will have reduced further the price of Brexiteer support for her deal and demonstrated to the EU that such a concession would win a majority at Westminster.The prospect of delaying Brexit has weakened the incentive to compromise on all sides at Westminster as each faction believes that extra time gives their preferred option a better chance of success.A delay could allow backbench MPs to take control of the Brexit process as they seek to build a cross-party consensus behind a softer Brexit.Such an outcome, which could see Britain remaining in both the single market and the customs union, is a nightmare for Conservative Brexiteers.The DUP are relaxed about a delay, pointing out that the only form of Brexit that presents a real threat to unionism is May’s deal with the backstop in its current form.From a strictly unionist point of view all other options, including remaining in the EU, are acceptable.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

So we certainly could see a woman on every Board of the FTSE 350 in 2019 - and I hope we do.”We can most definitely expect more positive progress in 2019.The three companies who have no female board members are: Millennium \u0026amp Copthorne Hotels, who operate 20 hotels in the UK and a further 100 across the world, Daejan Holdings a property group who own Africa House in Trafalgar Square and TR Property Investment Trust.Vicky Ford MP said that businesses that are still all male should take a look hard in the mirrorMillennium \u0026amp Copthorne Hotels split with their CEO Jennifer Fox in September 2018, after only appointing her to the role in June. Her departure was swiftly followed by that of another female non-executive, leaving the group with no women at the top table.A spokesperson for the company said: “These resignations were unexpected and the vacant positions on the Board created by them have yet to be filled.  “The Nominations Committee of the Board is in the process of conducting a search for at least one new independent director.The Group acknowledged that it needs to do more to promote gender ersity.Kwek Leng Beng is chairman of Millennium and Copthorne hotelsMark Jenner, Company Secretary for Daejan Holdings, said: “We have not appointed any executive directors for more than 30 years. We haven’t needed to.  “We appointed three representatives of the controlling family as non executive directors for succession purposes.  “We appointed two independent non executive directors as required by the Listing rules, they happen to be male.  “We don’t have any current plans to appoint any more directors for the time being as there are no vacancies but we keep the situation under review.”TR Property Investment Trust has only operated without a woman on its board for eight days, after Susie Proctor stepped down from her non-executive role last week.Hugh Seaborn, the company’s chairman, said: “This is very much a temporary state.“We have five board members and have had at least one woman as part of our leadership group for the last 17 years.“We are in the process of recruiting for the vacant position and have every chance of finding a high calibre female. I believe that ersity is fundamental for the balance and mix of a board.”A spokesman for the Government’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said: “Diversity is good for businesses and for the communities they serve.  “Thanks to a combined push from government and industry, in under a decade the number of all-male boards in the FTSE 350 has dropped from 152 to just three.“We still need greater ersity at the top and want to see women holding a third of senior positions in FTSE 350 companies by 2020.”Please review our commenting policyLeaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Michael Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe granted rare diplomatic protection by Britain to help secure release from IranTrump\u0026#39s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort sentenced to 47 months in prisonOne in three hospital patients admitted as an emergency to be sent home without an overnight stayNumber of patients told to take pills for early signs of high blood pressure to tripleComment: Let\u0026#39s end the \u0026#39shadowy practices\u0026#39 that stop women from breaking glass ceilingsRHS issues runner bean warning, after European bug makes top ten pest list for the first timeLondon mayor under fire after admitting he can do no moreTheresa May to make last desperate plea to EU to change Brexit deal as crucial vote loomsNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe granted rare diplomatic protection by British governmentSally Challen\u0026#39s son launches public appeal for her murder charge to be downgradedInstagram still promoting self-harm month after promising to ban graphic images,  findsCelebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief episode 1 recap: contestant Ayda Field roped in Robbie Williams – but can his cabaret win the day?The Parkinson’s Drug Trial: a Miracle Cure? episode 2 review: a raw, downbeat ending to this powerfully poignant documentaryComment: Is Philip Hammond\u0026#39s plan to thwart a true Brexit about to reach fruition?Scottish schools cutting subjects is hitting efforts to close attainment gap between rich and poor, RSE warnsNHS transgender clinic accused of covering up negative impacts of puberty blockers on children by Oxford professorMP criticises police for not investigating Sir Philip GreenTravelling Blind review: a charming travelogue with magical sensory experiences and a touching friendshipSpanish police rescue elderly man and woman locked up in \u0026#39house of horrors\u0026#39 in murder probeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"crufts day one pictures","story":"Started in  1891, Crufts is the most famous dog show in the world.

The party made a manifesto pledge to have 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, and introduced a new system whereby businesses would pay for these training positions. However, four years on, the perception of apprenticeships is still mixed and both students and companies say they need more support to help meet the government’s target. Apprenticeships got a boost in popularity and became more appealing to school leavers in the wake of higher tuition fees. Many students who might previously have submitted applications to universities without a second thought found themselves weighing up their options more carefully, and for some, an apprentice scheme proved to be a good alternative to a degree. Created with Sketch.Ucas chief puts the case for apprenticeships Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.However, despite the government’s target of bringing more young people into the workforce via apprenticeships, many school leavers still find it difficult to get the information they need about the schemes that are available. In some cases, schools are failing to provide information, and still focus on university places and Ucas forms. Moshe Shamash, 21, says that he had no clear idea about what he wanted to do when he left school, but he knew that university was not the right path for him. “It was a mixture of grades and the fact that I wasn’t sure,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I was hearing stories about people who didn’t get jobs after uni.”Shamash is now a software engineer apprentice at Workplace by Facebook, but he tells the Independent that it was not easy to pursue this path. “At school there was no mention of apprenticeships,” he says. “The general feeling that you have to go to uni was quite prevalent. They weren’t too impressed that I was going on an apprenticeship scheme.”This experience is echoed among other apprentices. Jack Moore, 20, an apprentice at Vodafone, says that although his school was initially supportive of applications for apprenticeship schemes, “that very quickly went away”. “Then it was all about Ucas and going to uni, so I was the only one in my year who actually went on to do an apprenticeship,” he says. Despite the lack of support from some schools, for many young people the benefits of doing an apprenticeship far outweigh the attractions of going to university. Nayan Maghmare, 19, is also on the apprenticeship scheme at Vodafone. He says he joined the scheme because it felt like a “win-win situation”. “You get corporate experience and you earn money. There are particular skills that you learn on the job that you might not learn at uni,” he says, highlighting time management in particular as a skill he has picked up in the workplace. Ishaan Korotan, 19, decided on the apprenticeship route for similar reasons, joining the scheme at Cisco. “I’m really interested in cyber security and I thought ‘what better way to learn about it than by working for the company’ –\u0026nbspin terms of knowledge and skills you get from working within the industry it’s quite valuable.”It is not all upsides, though.\u0026nbspSri Konreddy, 19, is also at Cisco, and says she has less free time than her friends who are still in education. “I’m adulting much sooner than my friends at university,” she says. However, she adds: “It’s a good thing for me. I’ve made friends for life and the support has been great.”Meanwhile, for businesses, while apprentices are widely viewed as a good thing, the government’s apprenticeship levy, aimed at supporting these schemes, has not gone down so well. The levy, which was introduced in 2017, requires employers paying more than £3m in total each year to allocate 0.5 per cent of their payroll costs to training. This financial obligation was supposed to support the apprenticeship strategy –\u0026nbspbut in 2017-18, apprenticeship starts were down 24 per cent year-on-year, falling from 494,900 to 375,800. James Reed, chairman and chief executive of Reed Recruitment, says: “It’s clear that the apprenticeship levy is in urgent need of simplification in order to make a success of it. “It is also clear that financial incentives on their own are not enough to achieve the kind of results the government had hoped for.”Schools refuse to let students hear more about technical coursesHammond to announce £125m new funding for apprenticeships and jobsBusiness groups urge apprenticeship reform as GSCE results roll inThe apprenticeship levy is poisoning our economyThe Independent announces new editorial apprenticeship schemeCharlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, has long been a vocal critic of the levy, although he supports the aim of increasing the numbers of apprentices joining the workforce. “The apprenticeship levy was supposed to increase the number of new apprentices, in a genuine effort to combat the UK’s skills gap,” he says.“On paper, so far so good but in reality it has proven an unmitigated disaster, and has led to a catastrophic collapse in new apprenticeship starts.“The problem is part perception, and part that the levy is just too damn complicated and time consuming to claim for businesses already heavily burdened with the existing tax bureaucracy. “Business owners, especially of SMEs, just don’t have the time to get their heads around how to claim the money. What we need is a simple system where the government pays businesses directly for each apprentice they take on.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They certainly should have been. \u0026nbspWith profits plunging by 45 per cent to £160m, their annual payments this year will amount to just 3 per cent of their salaries.\u0026nbspNo one working at the retailer now will have experienced anything like that.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis to close Knight \u0026amp Lee department storeM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesYou have to go back to 1954 to find a comparable number, when their grandparents, great-grandparents in some cases, received 4 per cent.\u0026nbspBut there are reasons to feel cheerful\u0026nbspeven if it might not look that way.For a start, John Lewis is one of those vanishingly rare institutions in Britain in which everyone who works there really is in it together.\u0026nbspRetail CEOs regularly pick up millions for doing far worse than the leadership of this one, where there are no such rewards for failure. Lewis bosses do fairly well for themselves, but the salary of the top paid executive is fixed to a multiple (75) of the average hourly rate of non management partners. You won’t find anything like that at the retailers which are listed on the stock market.\u0026nbspThey also get\u0026nbspthe same percentage bonus that\u0026nbspeveryone else does.\u0026nbspThere are none of the free shares other retail bosses get through long term incentive schemes, which aren’t really long term and only incentivise them to feather their own nests.\u0026nbspThat’s has to be worth\u0026nbspsomething.\u0026nbspBetter still is the fact that John Lewis isn’t firing people in the way other retailers are, retailers\u0026nbspthat are barely making any money at all.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis’ numbers aren’t pretty. They have been hit as a result of its IT investments, various one off costs, and the fact that the chain, which also owns Waitrose,\u0026nbsphas had to respond to the widespread discounting that’s been going on as reeling rivals struggle to make sales.\u0026nbspThe latter causes a particular problem for a chain that\u0026nbspboasts of “never being knowingly undersold”.\u0026nbspThing is, the discounting it\u0027s been forced to match\u0026nbspisn’t sustainable. It will die off as struggling rivals\u0026nbspdie off, if not before.\u0026nbspAt some point you can see there being maybe two or three general retailers left on the British high street. One of them will be John Lewis. Another will be Mike Ashley’s ‘Harrods of the High Street’ amounting to an amalgamation of what\u0027s left of House of Fraser and (probably) Debenhams.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

If accepted this would have made the property he most expensive single home ever to be sold in Britain. It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.“At first glance this monthly surge could be a bout of pre-Brexit confidence but nothing has changed. We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nearly 200 families are in limbo waiting to hear where their child will be for the start of the\u0026nbspautumn term.So why are more children missing out on places at their preferred schools? Quite simply, there are more pupils entering secondary school than in previous years, making the competition tougher.And in some cities, the provision of school places is failing to keep up with a\u0026nbsppopulation bulge which is now moving into secondary education. Often, more housing is approved before a new school has opened up, making matters worse.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Handout photo taken with permission from the Twitter feed of Robert Berg of scaffolding which has blown down in strong winds in Hampstead, north London.

Government forecasts show that secondary school pupil numbers will rise by 15 per cent over a nine-year period. The population is expected to peak at 3.3m in 2027 –\u0026nbsp418,000 more than in 2018.But not all parts of the country will experience a shortage of school places. A child’s chance of winning a place at their preferred school\u0026nbspvaries significantly depending on where they live.The problem appears to be most acute in London and its surrounding counties, as well as other cities with significant population growth.Parents to protest after children left without any school placesA recent survey suggests that only 6 per cent of children in Somerset did not get their first choice secondary school, compared to more than a third in London. And more than 700 children were left with no secondary school place at all in the capital last week.All this has angered\u0026nbspparents, who say multiple warnings were made about the baby boom and its impact on places.For a number of years, councils, schools and unions have spoken up about a potential shortage of secondary places. And yet in some areas, not enough forward planning appears to have taken place. \u0026nbspThe government says it\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspincreased the number of free schools to ensure there are enough places, but these are not always in the right areas. And some may not have not opened in time.Moreover, councils, who are responsible for making sure there are enough places, are not able to create schools. They also cannot force academies and free schools to expand to take more pupils.And it can be difficult to encourage a school to expand if they lack the space and resources to do so.State schools are struggling to pay for repairs to their existing buildings and class sizes have been rising amid squeezed budgets. Other secondary schools may be reluctant to admit more pupils due to fears that they will not have enough staff to teach and look after the children properly.With the swathe of problems facing secondary schools, we can expect more parents across the country to speak up and protest about the lack of provision over the next few years. The problem is not going away anytime soon.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

For its devoted fans it has a symbolic value totally unrelated to its workability, its true cost or the glaring self-interest of its proposers, whereas non-believers see nothing but a deranged and costly vanity project.brexit is like a sitcom where at the start of the episode the main character tells a casual lie about being able to skye to impress someone and now they\u0027re at the end of the episode in a plane about to jumpBrexit is like if Farage \u0026amp Johnson said “May we make you an *amazing* apple crumble?” \u0026amp then 18 months later handed you a leaking bag of maggots \u0026amp offal. You shouldn’t have to eat it.‘Asking me to support Brexit is like asking me to punch my constituents in the face,’ said Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, which voted 66:34 to leave. ‘It doesn’t make it easier if you tell me my constituents want to be punched.’Watching this government deal with Brexit is like being locked outside your house while you can see people inside setting fire to the furniture as the law’s telling you you can’t go in and stop them.Brexit is like living in a superhero movie that has no heroes, just loads of incompetent villains fighting over who is more evil.Brexit is like a bad novel. You are so far into it you just want to skip to the end to see if it ended as badly as it had begun.Watching Brexit is like trying to reverse engineer the rules of cricket by listening to the radio. I have absolutely no idea what is going on.Brexit is like the UK took a motorway exit, then found the road turning into a rutted grassy track, and now the car\u0027s stuck in a muddy field, there\u0027s no help in sight, it\u0027s getting dark, everyone\u0027s shouting at the driver, and the passengers are beginning to worry about food.Watching Brexit is like watching someone try and plug a coaxial aerial cable into a HDMI port. There is a lot of anger, a lot of swearing, and a lot of remarks about how this used to work before.#Brexit is like going back to Windows 3.1I\u0027m sure most people remember a kid at school who just lied constantly? Who refused to back down, however outlandish the lie, and however it was disproven?Trying to extricate ourselves from the EU, and Brexit, is like a multiple transplant patient attempting to give all the donated organs back.Paying my taxes to pay for Brexit is like asking a guy on death row if he has any change to put in the meter for the electric chair.Brexit is like watching Bandersnatch with your bae where bae is 70,000 Conservative party members hogging the PlayStation controller \u0026amp  choosing the most WTF option every time.!Brexit is like the shit that never comes. Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.Brexit is like Liverpool trashing all its links to The Beatles and spending all its time and energy building Esther McVey World.Trying to understand Brexit is like trying to figure out what colour the letter seven smells like.Brexit is like being in a plane hurtling towards the ground with the pilot and co-pilot arguing over who would crash it better.Brexit is like going to the doctor, being told you need an operation, agreeing to it, then finding out they are going to cut off your cock \u0026amp sew it to your forhead...My mentions have taught me that Brexit is like Trump’s wall. For its devoted fans it has a symbolic value totally unrelated to its workability, its true cost or the glaring self-interest of its proposers, whereas non-believers see nothing but a deranged and costly vanity project.brexit is like a sitcom where at the start of the episode the main character tells a casual lie about being able to skye to impress someone and now they\u0027re at the end of the episode in a plane about to jumpBrexit is like if Farage \u0026amp Johnson said “May we make you an *amazing* apple crumble?” \u0026amp then 18 months later handed you a leaking bag of maggots \u0026amp offal. You shouldn’t have to eat it.‘Asking me to support Brexit is like asking me to punch my constituents in the face,’ said Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar, which voted 66:34 to leave. ‘It doesn’t make it easier if you tell me my constituents want to be punched.’Watching this government deal with Brexit is like being locked outside your house while you can see people inside setting fire to the furniture as the law’s telling you you can’t go in and stop them.Brexit is like living in a superhero movie that has no heroes, just loads of incompetent villains fighting over who is more evil.Brexit is like a bad novel.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspMowlem\u0026nbspwas instrumental in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This\u0026nbspallowed\u0026nbspthe screen to blend into the wall behind it.TVs are turns on for only five hours a day on average, yet they occupy a large space on the wall in the living room,\u0026nbspthe firm\u0026nbspsaid at the time.\u0026nbspThis means TVs hang on the wall just as a black screen for more than 19 hours every day. With a TV turned off, it is easier to see dust or fingerprints on the screen – especially when the screen is large.Efforts to minimise the visual impact of wires trailing behind the TV have also been made previously, with high-end sets now shipping with Samsung\u0027s OneConnect box.Galaxy Fold: Samsung plans two more foldable phonesIt works by combining all the wires into one cable that can be threaded relatively tidily up to the TV.\u0026nbspSamsung already makes use of wireless power technology in some of its devices, including its flagship range of Galaxy S10 smartphones.There is no word yet on when a wireless television\u0026nbspmight be released and Samsung does not comment on rumours surrounding unreleased products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.The team stuck electrodes into the water of four hot springs, and left them for a month to be colonised by the bacteria.“The natural conditions found in geothermal features such as hot springs are difficult to replicate in laboratory settings,” said Dr Haluk Beyenal, who supervised the study.\u0026nbsp“So, we developed a new strategy to enrich heat-loving bacteria in their natural environment.”Some of these electricity-producing bacteria have the power to convert toxic pollutants into less harmful substances.Two types of bacteria ‘consistently low in people with depression’As they do so, the electrons passing through their body as they digest their food are dumped outside their bodies on minerals or metals, using hair-like structures that protrude from their bodies like wires.This produces a stream of electricity in an efficient process that can conceivably be used in low-power applications.While scientists hope that the\u0026nbspmicrobes could one day\u0026nbsppower\u0026nbspall kinds of systems, they have been limited by the handful of varieties that have been grown in labs.But by employing the naturally occurring populations in places like Yellowstone, they hope they can develop something that helps to both produce electricity and clear up pollutants.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts explain whyClick to followIndy PoliticsGeoffrey Cox has found himself in the growing dictionary of BrexitismsThere was a bizarre moment in the Commons on Thursday when MPs appeared more concerned with an item of Tudor attire that covered a man’s dignity, than they were with governing the country.The codpiece, as modelled by Henry VIII in almost any portrait, is a sort of upturned pouch designed to shield and also draw attention to a gentleman’s crotch.But the word’s vague similarity\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspattorney general Geoffrey Cox’s surname\u0026nbspand to a particular legal device, means it has now entered the growing dictionary of Brexitisms that afflicts our news copy.Phrases such as “the Malthouse compromise”, “the Brady amendment”, “Canada plus, plus, plus”, “Maximum Facilitation”, “Max Fac 2”, \u0026nbsp“the backstop” and “the backstop to the backstop” will now be joined by “Cox’s codpiece”.It manifested out of Cox’s efforts to secure a new addition to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement – he wants to use a legal instrument to create\u0026nbspa legally binding way for the UK government to say it wants Britain to leave the dreaded “backstop”\u0026nbsp(an arrangement the UK could otherwise be trapped in indefinitely if it fails to secure a future trade deal with the EU by 2020).Created with Sketch.

What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order.”A canny way for the attorney general to avoid answering what had actually been quite a difficult question on the government’s approach.The problem for Mr Cox is that as far as anyone can tell at this point, it does not look like his negotiations to secure a codicil or an addendum or an annexe or anything else to\u0026nbspthe agreement are going anywhere.The EU – which is adamant that the backstop in its current form should remain untouched – said that there is no solution to the impasse in sight.If Cox cannot achieve an adequate change, the government will\u0026nbspnot get the support of Tory MPs and the DUP, and the government’s deal falls.The irony maybe that, given the intransigence in Brussels, whatever the attorney general does come back with in a bid to convince Tory Eurosceptics, may represent an altogether different item of biblical attire.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This speech looks set to be an admission of failure.“After two years of negotiation, the government is simply incapable of delivering a Brexit deal that protects jobs, the economy and people’s livelihoods.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This report lays out the scale of the problems and a clear way forward.\u0026nbspThe home secretary must act now, setting clear short and longer-term objectives for the department and UK immigration policy.Windrush victims ‘still homeless and being betrayed by Home Office’A Home Office spokesperson said: “This report calls on the government to publish a clear vision for immigration, which the government has done through the white paper on the UK’s future skills-based immigration system, published last year.“Our proposals would mean we have a single, skills-based immigration system that will allow us to attract the talented workers so that the UK prospers, but also delivers on the referendum result, ends free movement and improves border security.“We are resolute in our determination to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation and have commissioned a Lessons Learned review with independent oversight and scrutiny to establish what went wrong and prevent it happening again.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We’ve taken a look at some of his key\u0026nbsppolicy principles:Mr Umunna wants means-tested tuition fees and the reintroduction of maintenance grants to help poorer students – without “wasting money” on the wealthiest students by axing fees altogether.Scrapping student fees a waste of money, says UmunnaHe writes: “Rejecting the simplistic policy of scrapping all fees does not mean that we should put up with the status quo. Far from it. But progressives must be prepared to say where we think a policy, no matter how popular, is not the best use of public money.“In this case a more targeted approach would achieve significantly better social mobility outcomes for the same cost. Which is why rather than scrapping fees altogether we should favour means-testing fees and reinstating maintenance grants.”The TIG spokesman\u0026nbspsuggests a “hypothecated” tax to tackle the NHS crisis, where the revenue from a specific tax would be ring-fenced for the health service.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

However, the current National Insurance system is ineffective, a hypothecated (tax) is now needed. If voters can see the link between what goes out of their pay packet and into the NHS, it will make the case for giving the NHS the resources it needs much more powerful.”“It need not be the only revenue stream for the NHS – if it were, the danger is the service would receive less revenue in a recession and more at times of growth – but it would certainly help bring the public round to paying more tax for something they treasure.”Mr Umunna calls for a tax hike on shareholders receiving idends. He wants to end the “manifest unfairness” of idend income being taxed at as low as 7.5 per cent – far lower than the 20 per cent basic rate of income tax. He also wants to “incentivise” companies to tackle boardroom pay.“It’s simply wrong that those with the most resources are benefiting from lower rates of tax than the tens of millions of hard-working families. And they are doing so at huge cost to the exchequer.“We urgently need to put in place a regulatory framework to incentivise companies to adopt pay structures for senior executives based on long-term equity and debt holdings: linking pay packages to the long-term fortunes of the company, with shares vesting over periods of at least five years, will encourage company leaders to take a longer-term view.”The MP wants to replace some of the privatised utilities with “public benefit companies” – while avoiding the “old-school renationalisation”.“Not only is the price tag for traditional renationalisation huge, but those industries’ borrowings would become part of the national balance sheet – restricting a progressive government’s ability to borrow for priorities like infrastructure investment.“An incoming progressive government could legislate to force companies providing key public services to write the provision of public benefit into their constitution, taking precedence over profit-making. It can then insist on taking a “foundation share” in each company as a condition of its operating licence.”Mr Umunna suggests a new “Citizens Service” giving young people the chance to take part in voluntary work. He thinks it could help “bring people together as they begin their adult life”, but stresses it would not be a return to mandatory military service.“As progressives we should be prepared to get beyond visions of the past and create a version of national service that succeeds for today’s world in achieving the one thing that those who actually undertook it are pretty much agreed on it brought people from an array of different backgrounds and different parts of the country together in a way like no other.“Let’s be clear. This is not a call for compulsory military service – whatever other objections it’s the last thing the armed forces say they want. Instead this is a call to look seriously at developing a programme of national service that will have the effect of bolstering social cohesion for generations to come.”Umunna addressing the press conference where the formation of TIG was announced (Stefan RousseauPA Wire)Mr Umunna thinks the “circus” of PMQs should be scrapped and MPs be moved to a “horseshoe” shaped chamber to make politics less adversarial. He also proposes voting at 16, the state funding of political parties and the adoption of the additional member system – a form of proportional representation.“Parliament’s culture and ways of working need to be overhauled. It operates like a giant ornament stuck in a time warp instead of a modern legislature. PMQs is a circus which does a disservice to public debate and on a weekly basis illustrates all that is wrong with the status-quo: witless, tribal, unoriginal, uninspiring.“To invigorate democracy in an increasingly erse country the next radical government might consider a new citizenship package: voting at 16, polling stations in schools combined with a compulsory civics GCSE and compulsory voting in one’s first election.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or do you want to Remain?’ “It would be a confirmation referendum, a bit like what happened with the Good Friday Agreement.”Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the Labour leadership has\u0026nbsprowed in behind Mr Trickett after a strong backlash from dozens of Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas, who have vowed to oppose any\u0026nbspfresh referendum.One MP said: “There are a lot of people who are really angry. At this point we should be pushing for a deal.“Some have already said they won’t support another referendum\u0026nbspbut there is a larger group that might go with the whip but are just really worried about the direction we’ve taken.”Ian Lavery, the party chairman, has also raised strong concerns about the party’s position, warning\u0026nbspthe shadow cabinet this week that\u0026nbspMr Corbyn would not become prime minister if the party backed a fresh\u0026nbspreferendum.Mr Corbyn said yesterday that\u0026nbsphis meeting with Sir Oliver and Mr Boles, together with Labour’s Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock, had left him\u0026nbsp”more certain than ever” that a Brexit deal could be agreed.\u0026nbspWriting for the Daily Mirror, he said:\u0026nbsp“Yesterday, I saw senior Labour and Conservative MPs to discuss a close economic relationship with the EU, which would help protect jobs like those of the Honda workers in Swindon, some of whom I also met.“I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it.“I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union.”Appearing to shift away from backing a fresh referendum, the Labour leader said a soft Brexit deal was “the best Brexit compromise for for both 17 million Leave voters and 16 million Remain voters”, adding: ”But we can’t accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome, so we also support preparing for a public vote in case parliament is not able to achieve a sensible Brexit.”Mr Corbyn’s latest attempts to help pave the way for a Brexit deal are likely to anger party members and many MPs, who insist it should be focusing its attention on a fresh referendum that could stop Britain leaving the EU.While the “Common Market 2.0” proposal being pushed by Sir Oliver and Mr Boles is\u0026nbspnot identical to Labour’s own preferred\u0026nbspplan, there is a significant degree of overlap, raising the prospect of a cross-party consensus for a soft Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs will vote on Ms May’s proposed deal next week. If it is rejected a second time, the government has promised to let the Commons vote on whether to pursue a no-deal outcome or seek to extend the Article 50 process.A Labour spokesperson said: “The best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power.“If we cannot get a general election Labour supports all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused Ms Bradley of\u0026nbsp“publicly interfering with the rule of law”.Ms Rudd made her comments about Ms Abbott in a radio interview later in the day, immediately leading the Labour politician to accuse the cabinet minister of using “outdated, offensive” language.Referring to abuse suffered by politicians, the pensions secretary said: “It’s worst of all if you are a coloured woman.“I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse, and I think that’s something we need to continue to call out.”Labour MP Danielle Rowley said the cabinet minister had undermined “an important point about abuse”, adding: “She clearly gets her language from the same bygone era as her abhorrent welfare policies.”Historically, the term “coloured” was associated with enforced racial segregation in the United States during the era of Jim Crow laws – with African Americans forced to use “coloured-only” public services.\u0026nbspThe work and pensions secretary returned to cabinet in late 2018 with the welfare brief, after she was forced to resign as home secretary during the fallout from the Windrush scandal.Ms Leadsom’s gaffe came in response to Labour’s Naz Shah MP, who asked about calls by more than 50 cross-party parliamentarians to adopt an official definition of Islamophobia.\u0026nbspIn her response, the minister said: “She raises a very important point about whether we should seek a definition of Islamophobia and I would encourage her to perhaps seek an adjournment debate in the first instance so she can discuss with Foreign Office officials.”Ms Shah said she was “shocked” by the response and that Ms Leadsom’s response had implied that “British Muslims are foreigners”.\u0026nbspLeadsom encourages debate on Islamophobia to be run past foreign officeThe comments come amid the row over antisemitism in the Labour Party and Islamophobia in the Conservatives, but created the impression of a government struggling to get its message across.Ms May will aim to try and get the cabinet in line ahead of next week, when the government faces a series of critical votes in the\u0026nbspCommons which could spell the end of her key policies on Brexit and even the collapse of her administration.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

If accepted this would have made the property he most expensive single home ever to be sold in Britain. It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.“At first glance this monthly surge could be a bout of pre-Brexit confidence but nothing has changed. We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The\u0026nbsp ring was a reminder to men in the remote community in South Sudan that the child was “ready for marriage”.The South Sudanese women’s rights activist turned radio host recalls that haunting memory and countless others she has encountered in her work while speaking to the audience of Peace of Her Mind.The weekly talk show is South Sudan’s first female-run radio programme and it tackles some of the toughest and most grim issues women face in the world’s youngest country, including child brides.It\u0026nbspairs on South Sudan’s Eye Radio, which\u0026nbspbroadcasts across the country. It was set up last summer,\u0026nbspin conjunction with Oxfam International.\u0026nbsp“The radio is changing people’s minds. People are listening to the show and learning,” Ms Kiden tells\u0026nbspThe Independent from her office in Juba, where the show is based. \u0026nbspKiden grew up in a refugee camp in Uganda after fleeing South Sudan in 1995 during the country’s 20-year bloody war for independence with the north.She was inspired by her mother, who fetched water for others in the camp to make money to keep her children fed and clothed. And so on returning to South Sudan in the early 2000s, Ms Kiden\u0026nbspdedicated her life to fighting for women’s rights, including helping set up the radio show.“Most of the\u0026nbspwomen suffering from gender-based violence are located in the remote areas of the country. They don’t know they are even allowed to talk, that they can say no. It’s hard to get access to the areas\u0026nbspbut radio can often get there,” she adds.Gender-based violence is an increasing problem in South Sudan, which plunged back into civil war in 2013,\u0026nbspafter gaining independence from the north in 2011.1.5 million on brink of starvation in South Sudan, despite peace dealThe UN has said rape was used as a weapon of war in the five-year conflict, which nominally ended in the autumn with a peace deal signed between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and rebels.Women have been among the most affected by the violence. According to\u0026nbspUnicef, 65 per cent of women and girls have experienced physical andor sexual violence in their lifetime, and approximately 51 per cent have suffered domestic violence.Meanwhile, poverty, violence and hunger are behind a spike in child marriages as families are increasingly forced to promise their young daughters to grooms in exchange for food and cattle dowries or protection.Although official statistics are not available, in areas like Nyal, in the north, Oxfam said new data it has gathered showed as much as 71 per cent of all girls were married underage, making it the second highest rate in the world after Niger.\u0026nbspWomen are traditionally expected to be the breadwinners, responsible for securing food and water for the family as well as being the chief parent and housekeeper,\u0026nbspMs Kiden explained.But at the same time, they are rarely given the opportunity to express themselves, are often not permitted to go to school and do not\u0026nbsp realise what their rights are, she added.Poverty and hunger are fuelling the rise in South Sudan’s child bridesLost boys: the child soldiers of South SudanSouth Sudan’s need for humanitarian funding is ever more urgentThis is at the heart of Peace of her Mind, which does not pull any punches with its subject matters.So far, they have tackled everything from child marriage and the dangers of early childbirth to domestic violence and rape.The pilot was first aired last summer and the show started broadcasting every Friday in the autumn. It reaches communities from the south to the north of the country.Its main host is veteran South Sudanese reporter Hellen Samuel known as “Mama Hellen” who said it was an important platform for women to learn their basic rights and open a conversation about taboo subjects in South Sudan.Ms Kiden said the all-female team were surprised when at the launch of the show most of the callers were men. \u0026nbsp“I had one male caller defending child marriage. He was saying that by the time a woman was 20 she was too old and no one would marry her,” Ms Kiden explains. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoice Kiden is a host on South Sudan’s new Peace of Her Mind show tackling issues women face in the war-ravaged country (Oxfam International )“I always lead by example and so used myself as one,” she adds.Ms Kiden told the man she was 30,\u0026nbspunmarried, and armed with a university degree that allowed her to secure a decent living to properly support her family. She said she was not worried about finding a husband.“I said that letting a girl be educated would be double the profit,” she jokes:\u0026nbsp“This lady would be able to buy him many more cows through working.”Another male caller argued child marriage was important as it helped South Sudan increase its population.“I told them there are a lot of cases of women dying in childbirth because their bodies were not prepared to give birth,” she recalls. \u0026nbspSlowly the team have noticed a change in attitudes of those calling into the show.Rhea Catada, who works for Oxfam in South Sudan, says that radio is an important medium in South Sudan, where literary rates are very low.According to the UN’s latest statistics, 80 per cent of women in South Sudan cannot read or write, while 70 per cent of men are illiterate.“Radio is very influential, and the show is sparking important debates,” she tells The Independent.“It’s also important that this show is independent,” she adds.Radio is very influential, and the show is sparking important debatesIn the studio there is a sign reminding radios hosts not to play the political anthems of either the regime or the opposition. The team are not affiliated with any political group.Ms Kiden says the show, giving women a voice, came at a crucial time.The government promised in the peace deal to ensure that 35 per cent of the country’s executive positions were filled by women – but that has yet to happen.\u0026nbsp“Women are behind everything in South Sudan and are the most affected by the conflict,” Ms Kiden says.“It is important for their voice to be heard so that lawmakers, officials, leaders can know the full impact of the conflict on our country and so how to put it back together again.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV. It’s overwhelming.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In the northern hemisphere, the spring equinox always falls in what month ”Anne: “December.”Ben Shephard: “The Ace Of Spades was a UK Top Ten hit in  for which hard-rock band ”Ang: “N-Dubz.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What McVitie’s chocolate biscuit is named after a flightless bird ”Andy: “Dodo.”Ben Shephard: “In the  film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which British actor starred as Doctor Frank N Furter ”Tracey: “Sir Anthony Hopkins.”YOU think Theresa May’s got a job on her hands   Spare a thought for the staff on E’s Celebs Go Dating, where they’ve signed up Kerry Katona for the new series. ’Cos that really is the TV equivalent of trying to shove a boulder up Kilimanjaro.Hiring a woman who introduces herself to every potential suitor by announcing: “I’ve got five kids and three ex-husbands, but don’t let that put you off” and describes herself as a “blue-tick shag”, which I thought had wiped out nearly every sheep in West Glamorgan back in .In fairness to Kerry, it does also hint at a level of fame that’s way above the rest of the agency’s clients, who include the thoroughly obnoxious Che Healey, from Hollyoaks, Made In Cha manchild Sam Thompson, Pete Wicks off Towie and someone called David Potts, who could be Mark “The Beast” Labbett’s Chase stunt double, judging by the size of him.None of them, of course, will find anything approaching love on a show where they now boast an impressive  per cent failure rate across six series. What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

And prosperity hasn’t found its way to, say, Greece, or the vast numbers condemned by the euro to unemployment.And it’s hard to swallow anyway from a man whose economy is flat-lining and his cities under siege from enraged, ­yellow-vested anti-EU protesters.Macron admits the EU has problems and speaks of the “European trap”. But, incredibly, it turns out this trap is “NOT being part of the European Union”.

It’s like a runaway horse.“Don’t watch it go, or let others be the ones to tame it.“The current lot are still in the stable, events have overtaken them and they cannot catch that horse now.”He will add: “We must tame it – our generation. It’s time for a new generation to take over and govern dferently”.Blasting today’s political leaders as “a profession of insincerity”, Mr Mercer will also insist all MPs must be more honest and upfront with voters to win back their trust.Turning on some older Tories, Mr Mercer - tipped as a future Tory leader – will go on: “I love many of my colleagues dearly, but we’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last twenty years.“We must be courageous enough to hold a mirror up to ourselves”.Speaking at an event organised by the think tank Onward, Mr Mercer will also call for the Tories toto a more compassionate brand of One Nation politics after two years of bitter feuding over Brexit.Showing empathy is the key to reclaiming millions of centre ground voters who currently feel politically homeless, he will argue.The Plymouth Moor View MP will insist Tory MPs must “walk in people’s shoes, govern with compassion as well as fiscal competence, look for common ground, reject the extremes, and ditch the spin”.He will added: “There is a country out there, full of hope, full of optimism, desperately looking for something to vote for.“We are not a hard left country – people don’t want the socialism of Jeremy Corbyn. They want a modern, centre-right values led party.“If we do that, we’ll reach out to plenty of people who feel politically homeless. We’ll connect. We’ll build a movement, not a party.”Mr Mercer will also name-check a series of younger Tory MPs as the party’s future in his speech.He will champion two campaigners for causes from more ordinary backgrounds, AE nurse Maria Caulfield and former postman Scott Mann.And he also heaps praise on Tracey Crouch, who resigned as Sports Minister to force through curbs on fixed odds betting terminals, as well as Cabinet Office minister and ex-No aide Oliver Dowden.Mr Mercer’s broadside heaps yet more pressure on Mrs May to set her departure date for later this year once Brexit has taken place.The PM was forced to promise she would stand down before the  general election in December to fend off a bid by angry Brexiteer Tories to oust her.But despite her own MPs growing frustrations with her, Mrs May last week signalled she wants to stay on in No for some time yet to deliver on her domestic agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The judge has made his decision.“My son is serving a prison sentence and so are we.“If people can’t work anyone out I think it is wrong to go and do something to them.”During his trial the ISIS disciple’s barrister Rebecca Trowler claimed that Ludlow’s autism and depression made him vulnerable to grooming but the judge, Nicholas Hilliard, QC, told him he was “nobody’s fool”.Ludlow’s mother continued: “He has a heart and soul – he knows right and wrong.“My son would not have done nothing.“If you want to go and talk to the police – they can make up loads of stories about him.“We know him. He knows what he is like and his legal team know him. That is why they have done all that they can.

You were well able to resist the Prevent Programme and did so.You are nobodys fool. You were no-ones unwilling instrument or tool.Theres nothing about the videos you made which remotely suggest to me you were. You were certainly acting in concert with Abu Yaqeen.I have seen no sign you are anything other than an enthusiastic participant in a joint plan.The court heard Ludlow set up a Paypal and Facebook account called Antique Collections as a front to send money to a man with IS-links called Abu Yaqeen.But he was stopped at Heathrow Airport in February last year as he tried to board a flight to the Philippines.He attended a demonstration led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary in  and was invited to engage with the Met Police Prevent programme.Jailing him for le with a minimum of  years, the judge said: Your extremism ran very deep and for some time.There could be no other explanation for anyone planning to kill innocent people in a van for ideological reasons.No other sentence other than le imprisonment will be appropriate.There is much work to be done and much of it is in your own hands. "},{"url":null,"title":"hermes delivery driver exposed himself trial","story":"Robert Jenner, who claims to be a naturist, also strolled around a shopping centre in see-through trousers.The -year-old is said to have showed off his privates to a teen schoolgirl and pregnant woman while working as a self-employed courier for parcel firm Hermes.The girl, who was then aged , said she was in her school unorm when she passed Jenner in an alleyway in February last year.She said: “He had his penis out of his trousers.

It will never fly with Member States.“He wants a legal fix to a political issue.

An MCB spokesperson said: We hope it was an honest mistake and a slip of the tongue when Andrea Leadsom suggested that the Foreign Office be tasked with the responsibility to help define Islamophobia in Britain. If not, it would imply that British Muslims are to be regarded as foreigners and once again appears to play to the racist trope that Muslims can never be British enough that our concerns are treated equally.

Peter told the Echo: Everybody who met her was touched by her, she got people running and training, she was just amazing and awesome.

Former goalkeeper Jade Almond was originally hospitalised in July last year after falling back off a chair and smacking her head. The accident left the -year-old struggling to concentrate properly, suffering from uncontrollable shakes, and unable to walk. Doctors diagnosed her with al neurological disorder , which required intensive, privately-funded physio treatment. And after seven gruelling months of pound, crowd-funded physio, Jade was incredibly able to walk, run and dance again. She was discharged on February  this year, with footage from that day showing the teenager excitedly running up stairs.   She was also filmed jogging on a treadmill for the first time in seven months as she marked the end of her treatment. But in a cruel twist of fate, Jade, from Abram, Greater Manchester, was involved in a car crash on the M on her way home the same day. The former Wigan Athletic Ladies youth team goalkeeper was joined by mum Michelle Almond, sister Josie and two pals at the time. They claim the other cars driver was leaning over and trying to pick up popcorn from the vehicles floor when she ploughed into them. The impact of the crash has left Jade bed bound with the strength of a newborn baby, partially paralysed and unable to sit up unaided. The courageous teen said: Its heartbreaking being in this position and knowing all that hard work has been undone.   I was pretty much back to normal - able to run, dance and play football again - I was  per cent there and only had a bit of a tremor in my leg. After the car crash its worse than its ever been as now its affecting my whole body. During the crash, the other car allegedly ploughed into the groups vehicle, causing Jade to bang her head twice. She first realised there was a problem when she was unable to move her right arm to comfort her friend. Her legs then gave way as she tried to get out of the car. She recalled: On the day I was discharged from Sheffield we were all so happy. That night I had a commercial and street dance class and was so excited to go for the first time in ages.   We had music on in the car, were singing along and just having a really good time. I was talking to my friend when the crash happened and was facing left, I flew forward and banged my head and then again when we stopped. I first noticed that the back of my friends head was bleeding. I went to hug her because she was so upset and my hand wouldnt move, I was so confused. My left arm was moving but when I tried to move my right arm it was just stuck. I tried to stand up getting out of the car and I fell to the floor, my mum had to catch me. She added: In hospital I was just sitting there and couldnt move, my mum was tapping my leg but I couldnt feel anything at all. I was so scared and did panic because Id never had those symptoms before. I had an instinct it was an FND relapse, Id never had those symptoms before so it was a huge shock.   You couldnt make it up that on the day I left physio this happened. It was heartbreaking knowing all the hard work had been undone. Jade was initially treated at Salford Royal Hospital before being transferred to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. Footage shows how she is unable to sit up unaided. Instead, she is forced to rely on mum Michelle to prop her up. Jade said: From the elbow down on my right arm is paralysed, I cant move or feel it at all. Both my legs are really numb and weak and when I try to stand on them they just collapse. My sitting balance has completely gone - my core and my neck are really weak - and I cant sit straight. It seems like Ive lost all my strength, its like Ive only got the strength of a baby.   Even when Im lying down I have to have pillows under me or I fall to that right side. Its so frustrating not being able to move, all I want to do is get up and back to where I was or at least move instead of just lying in a bed all day. The family have already spent pound, on Jades original treatment. Now, they are raising more funds through GoFundMe to help cover the cost of further treatment needed after the crash. Jade said: Im desperate to get back to physio because weve learnt that intensive rehab is the way forward for me. Its what I need but the only place that provides it is expensive, weve got the proof it works but its hard to get back to that. We didnt put up a GoFundMe at first because we didnt want to ask for money. We didnt want to feel like we were begging for money - it felt wrong.   It took a few months to pluck up the courage to put one together but when we did we got pound in a few hours. We were shocked at the number of people wanting to help. The number of people wanting to help has been amazing. Treatment is expensive but its worth every penny - you cant put a price on it.She added: The dream is to be able to go back to football, dancing and acting - I just want a normal le back. Former NHS worker and mum Michelle, , said: Its heartbreaking seeing what shes going through now after everything. It was devastating seeing her go from a perfectly healthy girl and then go through what she did. Her le was on hold for those seven months as she couldnt go to college or do the things she loved such as football, acting and dancing.  Seeing her be able to run up stairs for the first time since it happened, go for a jog and dance again last month was absolutely amazing - it was the best feeling. [On the day of the crash] traffic had gone to a complete standstill. The woman behind me was apparently picking up popcorn off the floor and careered into the back of us at what felt like -mph. Jade was in the back and had direct impact, it was awful. For this to happen is heartbreaking but Jade has been so positive about it as shes seen she can improve.

As we celebrate International Women’s Day on Friday, five female generations of them tell us their experiences of being women in . The Merseyside family welcomed their fth generation, adorable baby Aliyza Irvine, just last year, with proud great-great grandmother Christina Seddon a whole eight decades her senior. Christina was born in the s, while Aliyza is getting set to mark her first birthday next month. Incredibly, all the women still live within two miles of each other in the Bootle and Walton areas of Liverpool – but they have all had very dferent experiences of le in the th and st centuries. Christina Seddon,  Best female superheroes of all time ranked - our  favourites I was born in December, , and le in post-war Liverpool for a young girl like me was brilliant. I have had a lovely le. I was one of nine children, and we had a really close, extended family. My first job was at the Williams Toffee factory and I worked in pubs and as a cleaner while raising my children. I got married when I was  and had nine children with my husband George, who worked at the Albert Docks. We had a lovely five-bedroom house. In the s, it was nice to have all these children. Every one of them was perfect. I loved being a mum. But, of course, it wasn’t all easy for women. We didn’t have a washing machine or a fridge and I would wash the clothes in the baby’s bath and peg them up in front of the fire. We got by. Sadly, George died  years ago, and I don’t go out as much as I used to. But I still love dancing and will still have a little dance at the pubI go out. Me and George used to like going dancing. I used to love wearing those s glamorous dresses and the swing skirts. I do feel like we live in a very dferent world today. There doesn’t seem to be as much innocence and the streets don’t seem like a safe place. I see my grandchildren all the time. It’s so nice to keep connected with the younger generations and keep busy, it keeps me young – along with the dancing. Christine Williams,    It was fantastic being a teenage girl in the s, the best time to be a teenager. I was born in  and, as the eldest of nine, I always had someone to play with. One of my memories is of dressing up my eldest brother, Tony, in girls’ clothes. I left school at , met the kids’ dad David at  – we orced in  – and was pregnant by the age of . It was the norm for me to follow that path, and I now have four children. I think women now handle things in a better way, and don’t automatically rush into having babies. They focus on their careers more. But I never look back. I have worked all my le and do part-time work as a barmaid at the moment. One of the amazing things about being in my s in  is I feel like I am in my s. I think women have outgrown men nowadays and have got a bit more of a voice – which can only be a good thing. Independence goes a long way. Sarah Irvine,  As a kid, we had a community club where we all went, and I’m still best friends with a girl who lived on my street because we all stayed in the same area. It’s not the same now. I don’t think there is that sense of community for younger girls. When I was  I used to be a dancer in clubs. My mum would look after Lois as I’d get back in around .am. We used to go out wearing hot pants and crop tops. I think I loved it so much because I was so active, my entire family are active. My grandma Christina never stops. After I finished the dancing I started caring for people, helping with their shopping and their medication. All I ever wanted was for Lois to come first and I think she feels the same way about Aliyza. People say to me: “I can’t believe you’re nearly .” But I think I’m in my prime. Women get better with age. Lois Irvine,   I love being part of a big family of women. My mum raised me on her own and she did her best for me. Without them, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. We all live very close to each other and I see them a lot. I look up to my great nan, Christina, because she’s always out shopping, she’s always busy – she’s a glam-ma. I wake up and enjoy being with my daughter and spending the day with her. I’ve always been working, in hotels, but then when I got pregnant I had to stop. But Aliyza is nearly one and she can go to part-time nursery soon. I love it that I can be independent and earn my own money. I want to raise my daughter the same way. I wouldn’t want my daughter to rely on anyone but me. I had her at , a similar age my mum had me and my grandma had her – but I think things are dferent for me. For one thing, my baby’s dad Jordan is still in the picture and helps me out with child care. For me, it was just me and my mum and my nan helped out. My mum always made me feel loved. It’s what I want to do for my daughter. Aliyza Irvine,  months  Mum Lois says: I want Aliyza’s le to be stable and good. We will be able to do more things in five years, I want to be able to take her on holiday and take her to places. I want to take her to Disneyland Paris – something I did as a child. It was the best experience, seeing the princesses. I think things are dferent now with social media and tablets. I won’t be giving her one of those until she’s a bit older. She’s got mates as well, she’s very social. I want her to have mates at school, I want her to have friends on the street like I did growing up. I’ll be happy with anything she does when she was my age – as long as she studies. I’d like her to go to university. I want to teach her to be independent and I want her to be herself, know who she is as a person and not rely on anyone. But, I don’t want her to be lonely, my friends have children and we see each other all the time. I’m hoping they will grow up and be best friends. I always felt loved and never bored growing up. That is something that I want for Aliyza. I always want her to feel like that.

Richard Scott – who died aged  last June – made a packet running the events at his “vast” farm, where Grenada TV’s Boot Sale Challenge was filmed from  to . The High Court in London was told Mr Scott’s eldest son Adam, , had worked side by side with his dad from the age of nine and had expected to be left the farm and business in Chelford, Cheshire. But in  after Richard wed Jenner Scott –  years his junior and two years younger than Adam – he wrote his son out of his estate. He left Jenner, his partner for  years, to control his millions.   Adam claims his father was not in his right mind when he made his final wills and is challenging them. In a preliminary hearing, his lawyers said he’d helped his dad run the estate and manage the car boot sales for more than  years. Judge Nicholas Caddick QC was told by Adam’s barrister William East: “Throughout his childhood, Richard encouraged Adam to involve himself as fully as possible on the farm.  Adam was assured he would one day take over the farm and the farm business.” He said Adam worked on the farm for little or no pay, often  to  hours per week and without holidays. But lawyers for Jenner claim Richard knew what he was doing when he disinherited Adam.  They said the pair’s relationship “completely broke down” after Adam tried to get his dad sectioned. Richard, who owned a Rolls Royce but preferred to drive around in an old Skoda, owned “a huge quantity of land” at the time of his death from cancer, the court heard. His business attracted controversy and he admitted he’d had menacing phone calls and a written death threat. Rory Brown, for Jenner, told the judge: “Jenner is the widow of the deceased and was appointed executor. There are lots of beneficiaries.”  Richard’s first we, Adam’s mum Janet, died in . Jenner’s sons, Gordon and William Redgrave-Scott, and Adam’s sister Rebecca Horley are in the wills. Judge Caddick granted an injunction barring Jenner, Gordon and William from “trespassing” on parts of the estate where Adam holds tenancies. The full trial is set for later this year.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together.

We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal over brexit mean","story":"NewsopinionNo deal over Brexit will mean UK learns same brutal truth our miners didMiners ed to work  years ago and without a deal they were picked off one by one before their industry faded awayShareByPaul Routledge:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionMiners at a demonstration at Maerdy Lodge Colliery in Gwent \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was  years ago this week that Britain’s coal miners went back to work after their epic -month strike for jobs. With brass bands playing, union banners aloft and families pushing buggies, they marched proudly to the pits with heads held high. Across Yorkshire, South Wales, Durham, Lancashire, Scotland and Kent, the stirring picture was the same. Nothing like it would ever be seen again. And nothing could disguise the brutal truth that they ed to work without a deal on the issue that provoked the dispute: pit closures. With no agreement, they were vulnerable to arbitrary decisions about their future. They were picked off one by one, and today their industry – which put the Great in Britain – has vanished.  The parallel is not exact, but the country faces a similar position in our orce from the European Union. Without a deal, we will be at the mercy of greater powers such as the USA – which insists that we eat chlorinated chicken – China and  unforgiving EU states. The stakes are as high for us today as they were for the miners in . It’s about survival, and Theresa May’s mantra – “no deal is better than a bad deal” – is self-defeating.  Any deal is better than no deal. As the countdown to Parliament’s meaningful vote on Brexit reaches its th hour, MPs should remember what happened to the miners, and not let it happen to us. If I were a Labour MPI would vote for the withdrawal agreement coming before the Commons any day now. It may not be perfect, it may be the shabby compromise that Vic Feather of the TUC always talked about. But it’s better than stepping, eyes closed, into the void.

Five teenage boys admitted their part in the incident at an earlier hearing, but a sixth boy denied a public offence and forced Ms Morris to give evidence at an earlier trial. Ms Morris told the trial that the incident left her feeling a bit shell-shocked, a bit raw. The boy was found guilty of a public order offence and was sentenced at Ipswich Magistrates Court on Thursday to a reparation order. The order requires him to complete  hours of work, through the youth service, over a three-month period. He was also ordered to pay Ms Morris pound compensation and pound in court costs.

During the operation, they also seized cash totalling pound,, three mobile phones, and drug-dealing paraphernalia including weighing scales, plastic bags and tick lists.

The missing airbag unit was discovered in a Citroen at his business premises. Wheatley, himself a cocaine addict, admitted being concerned in the supply of a class A drug and money laundering. This was a leading role and the police drugs expert concluded it was buying and selling on a commercial scale, said the prosecutor. The purity could suggest it was closely linked to the original source and on any view, given the quantities of both drugs and cash, it was in expectation of substantial financial gain. Mr Dunn added that the travel agency was a legitimate business, set up by Wheatley and two partners, but used by him as a drugs operation base. Recorder Judy Khan QC accepted he was under pressure to fund his own cocaine habit, said to involve him taking up to g a day. But on jailing him for eight years she added: I accept you were hands-on, exposed to a degree of risk, using your own home and your business address, and therefore not supervising from the wings and at the top of the supply chain. But it is right to observe you of all people know the misery and devastation this drug can cause.

But being a Duchess might not actually be as amazing as we like to think, as there are often many stressful things Kate has to juggle in a day. The mum-of-three must balance her royal le with family le, juggling engagements and s with dropping the kids off at school and finding time to walk the dog. But what other things make up her routine that arent exactly of the norm and how does she really spend her time during the day    Most people find it stressful having to pick one outfit to wear to work, or to go out on a date, but when it comes to daily le for Kate, she often has to plan for more than one occasion. According to Vanity Fair, the -year-old, can have to fit up to five outfit changes into her dayshe is out on royal business - this may include outfits for the school run, visiting a charity, an afternoon tea or a formal dinner. And when shes not out at events and meetings, the Duchess of Cambridge also has to deal with the stress of finding a private moment to enjoy by herself, which with a full household of staff around at all times, can be incredibly dfcult. Even when doing more mundane tasks, such as nipping out to the supermarket spotted in Waitrose, Kate is not alone while pushing the trolley up and down the aisles, but is followed by protection officers.   Despite having staff and a dedicated nanny to look after her children, it is thought that Kate prefers to do a lot of things each day for herself. For example she is often spotted dropping off and picking up her children from school, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte attending two dferent schools. Shes also a keen cook and when shes home she is said to enjoy preparing William a roast chicken dinner, as well as making her own sausages and homemade jams. And back when she was first settling into married le, Vanity Fair reported that Kate would also walk the familys Cocker Spaniel, Lupo, three times a day - though we imagine she has someone to do this for her when shes out on engagements now.   The Duchess has always been very fitness orientated and enjoys activities such as running, cycling and incorporates these ious work outs into her daily le. A royal insider told Mail Online: Kate is an exercise junkie. Pippa and Kate take their toned physiques extremely seriously. The duchess is reportedly also a fan of CrossFit and yoga, makes time to go for a run most days, enjoys cycling, and does all her workouts without a personal trainer!   After all of that is done, Kate may find herself spending the evening at a lavish event, such as the recent BAFTA Awards, where she and William dazzled as they made their way up the red carpet. However what the couple does on their nights off from banquets and balls might surprise you - because its probably the same thing you often find yourself doing after work. Reports say the couple sometimes venture out to their local pub to enjoy a drink, or theyll spend an evening avoiding being photographed by staying in and watching DVDs.   Essentially it seems Kate spends her days very much the same way most working mothers do, iding her time between all of her many responsibilites. However she just so happens to have a designer wardrobe of clothes to do it all in, meaning she looks fabulous no matter the task at hand. She does also have the added benefit of household staff, who can take care of all those pesky issues that arise out of the blue, and doesnt really have to worry too much about childcare what with having a nanny. So while some aspects of her le, such as her lack of privacy, may seem rather stressful and out of the ordinary to us, its fair to say, for the most part, her day to day le sounds pretty good!

Laureline Garcia-Bertaux, , was found dead in her back garden in Richmond upon Thames, south-west London, on Wednesday evening.Before she disappeared, a close friend revealed he thought the man his friend was meeting before the murder a bit suspicious and that he was a charismatic vet. Ms Garcia-Bertaux had been reported missing after she failed to turn up for work at public relations company Golin on Monday. Her friend Daniel Hughes, , told the Press Association he had not seen her for about a month, but had spoken to her best friend, who reported her missing. I think the last point the CCTV caught her was outside a Sainsburys on Saturday evening in Richmond, he said.   She was meant to go shopping in Oxford Street on Sunday, daytime. She was meant to meet a man for coffee on the Sunday evening. Were not sure when the murder took place, whether it was Saturday night or Sunday night. She was meant to move out of that house on Monday morning.  She met him in a shop or something like that and then he must have chatted to her then and they arranged a coffee on Sunday evening, he said. We dont knowshe went out to meet him or not because we dont know what the point was when that happened. Mr Hughes, who said he previously worked with Ms Garcia-Bertaux at the Discovery Channel, said she was single and lived alone with her two dogs.   Shes tall, got a lot of presence. Always very friendly, very talkative, would never have hurt anyone. Got a lot of confidence and passion, a lovely lady. She had a lot of friends as well, including me, he said. Im pretty harrowed about it. Ive been in that house, Ive been in that garden. Its creepy, its upset me quite a lot.  Members of Ms Garcia-Bertauxs family, who are believed to have flown into the UK from France, have been informed of developments and are being supported by specially trained officers, police said. No-one has been arrested and a post-mortem examination is to be carried out. A large police cordon has been put in place around the scene in Darell Road which extends to cover the garden and passageway area at the back of the terraced property.   With the noise of playing children echoing from a nearby school, forensics officers in blue suits could be seen erecting a large tent, with evidence markers visible down the narrow alley between a number of homes. Neighbour Bob Bassett, , told the Press Association that he knew of Ms Garcia-Bertaux, and would speak to her about her two large dogs.  She was quiet. I never saw a boyfriend, he said, adding that as far as he knows she lived in the ground-floor flat alone, and was originally from France. Another neighbour who did not want to be named said he had previously seen her with a Leonberger - a large breed of dog. He said others on the street have told him they had seen a man visiting the property now and again, and added: I did not see her very much.

For many people, there is a wonderful satisfaction that comes from popping a pimple - it’s almost euphoric, says Traube.  You not only relieve the physical pressure of the blockage, theres a pleasant mental effect as well from the release of dopamine, your brain’s happy chemical. Not only does this happen when you attend to your own spots, but it can also be experienced when you turn your attentions to someone s too. But whats the motivation  Well, here comes the good news and the bad news.   Firstly, the good news. According to Traube it is one surefire way of demonstrating love and committment. As disgusting as it might sound to some, that you would pick your partners pimples, that does show a certain closeness, a bond, an attachment between you and your partner, says Traube. If someone is on a first or second date, I don’t think you’re going in for a pimple pop. Or certainly run for the hillsthey do... However, it could also be a sign that you want to fix your partner, or that theyre trying to fix you.   For many, the skin itself can be a metaphor for the person or the relationship, Traube adds. Its kind of analogous to finding a solution. You look at it and go, Ew, it doesnt feel right, its on my partner, I need to fix it. In some regards, its a way to improve your husband. Or it could be a sign theyre stressed and need a release. The takeaway, Traube explains, is thatyour other half enjoys squeezing your spots, its more about them than it is about you. The key, he advises, is to be honest with themyou dont like that. Thats pretty important in relationships too.

He chased her out the door and pressed his fingers into her eyes, one at a time until she was bleeding profusely from her eyes.” The force of the assault caused the globes of her eyes to rupture. Police attended the scene soon as the grandmother fled the house to get help from a neighbour, according to local news station Pixll. They arrested Grief on three counts of violent assault for the incident. Its said Grief responded to the police so  when being told that he had gouged his grandmothers eye out. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, told ABC: She was right here on the porch. Her eyes were poked in and blood was pouring down her face. She told us she couldn’t see and she says ‘he blinded me, he blinded me’.”  The grandmother was rushed to Stony Brook University Hospital where she underwent surgery for approximately eight hours in an attempt to save her vision, according to local news station. However, she has been given a less than one per cent chance to regain any vision. Suffolk County District Attorney Timothy D. Sini said on Wednesday that this is “an extremely disturbing case.” He told the station: “When the defendant was talking to police and was told he had gouged his grandmother’s eyes out, he was very dismissive. “He said, ‘so ’ shrugged his shoulders, and appeared to be apathetic toward the situation.” Grief was arraigned on assault charged following the attack on February .

She played with her friends and spent time with her family just like every other child. But when she turned eight everything changed. She started noticing people looked at her strangely and pointed. Some parents wouldnt let their children play with her. Yulianna, who is now , has a huge birthmarkwhich covers most of her back and stretches around to her stomach. She also has smaller marks over the rest of her body, including lots on her legs. Speaking to , she said: I was quite a happy and carefree child. Before I was eight-years-old, I didnt pay much attention to my birthmarks.I remember myself looking at my skin in the mirror pretty much without any particular emotions. But after eight I started to notice all these eyes on me and fingers that were point on my legs, and words that people liked to say. In three words - I was bullied. It wasnt only comments, parents of another children didnt let me to play with their kids because they thought that I was contagious. As Yulianna, who lives in Warsaw in Poland, got older things only got worse and after years of teasing she started to just stay at home and only go outside when it was dark.  When I was  or  years old, I went with my friend to the beach, and of course people looked at me. Some old woman come to me with her advice on how to remove my warts, some waitresses in the cafe said unkindwords to me. Lots of things likethis happened that morning. My friend said to me oh my God, Julie! Walking with you just like walking with a monkey. I know it was just words and in some ways it was a joke.I wasnt angry at her, but after this I began to just sitat home all summer and walked for one or two hours in the evenings when it was dark.  I would just ask why me , why do I deserve this and thought that nobody would ever love girl with a black and hairy back. I was thinking that boys would never pick up me because they have choice to pick up a normal girl with perfect skin. I was a dalmatian, a giraffe, a cow, I was dirty, people thought thatthey spoke to me my birthmarks would jump at them. But when she grew older she decided enough was enough and it was time to start loving her body. I was so tired of hiding and being afraid of people, of their reactions and actions. I was hating myself for the weakness and that I felt so much pity towards myself. I then understood that nobody would help me just myself, to bring me up with my confidence.   The first thing I thought when I started analyze the reactions is that maybe % people really didnt know what it is. So in some point they were afraid of it.And then I understood thatthey all knew maybe my le and lives of the other kids and adults with CMN would be much easier. She set up an Instagram account to show off photos of her birthmark and her le, and she now has just shy of , followers.   She said: Im happy I did.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again.

These shares have a nominal value, at  pence per share, of £,.The second is for DFCSS to “agree to support resolutions which increase the club’s share capital and then allot shares specically to FPS”.Currently there is no provision in the Society’s rules to sell shares and an extraordinary general meeting would be needed to change that, and with it a vote by its members.The Financial Conduct Authority would also need to be contacted, a process which could take months.DFCSS already had a board meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and will discuss the proposals and their response as a board as well as with their members, despite the sharp time constraint.In a statement, the club added: “At a time when our primary focus is on retaining our Premiership status, we would prefer not to have to undertake an unnecessary time consuming and expensive full share issue and we hope that the Society will support us in agreeing to one of the suggested options.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee skipper martin woods says side need to keep their heads to avoid relegation","story":"Martin Woods says Dundee need to keep their heads in the “crazy” Premiership run-in as they attempt to battle their way to safety.The Dark Blues dropped back into the relegation play-off place after a - thumping dished out by Rangers last Wednesday on the back of a - home defeat to Hibs.However, it was a surprise result at Pittodrie that saw Woods  Co. drop back down the league as Hamilton Accies defeated Aberdeen -, with Saturday also seeing St Mirren close the gap below to one point by defeating Livingston -.Woods, has captained the side recently in Josh Meekings# continued absence, said: “Hamilton was a real shock, I didn’t see that coming at all.“Coming in to hear that after the game was a blow but there will be lots of ups and downs between now and the end of the season, we just need to take care of our own business and, hopefully, that will be enough to steer us clear.“I don’t think anybody would have seen after their game against Rangers, Hamilton going up to Aberdeen and winning - but it’s a crazy league.“Weeks ago, nobody would have seen us going to Tynecastle and getting a result so there will be ups and downs and we have to stick together.“We’ve looked through the Rangers game and seen what we can do better defensively as a team and take that on to the next bunch of games to get some points on the board.”With no match over the weekend due to the Scottish Cup taking priority, it’s been a welcome break for the Dark Blues after a couple punishing results.Woods hopes the breather will allow them to up their game when Hearts come calling on Saturday.“I think it’s been a tough run of games so it’s been good to sit back, reflect and get ready to go again,” he added.“We’ll work on a few things in the training ground and take it into the next bunch of games which are going to be vital.“We have a couple of tough ones coming up with Hearts at home, which we hope to get something out of, and then Celtic at home will be a day we have to be disciplined and get off to a lot better start than we did at Rangers.”If they keep their discipline and manage to up their level from the first half at Ibrox, Woods is confident their luck will turn to help them make it two wins in a row against Hearts, after their - victory at Tynecastle in January.He added: “Against Livingston, they went down to  men, we got a goal in the last seven minutes, we could’ve had a penalty against us so we’ll get days where things go for you.“That’s probably two in a row where nothing’s gone for us at all against Hibs and Rangers.“There will be loads of twists and turns before now and the end of the season, we just need to focus on our performance levels and try to keep that high.“We dropped in the first half against Rangers which wasn’t great but that was a mixture of both them being really good and us not doing as well as we could.“The first goal from a set-piece, we weren’t tight enough and got punished.“From there you could see them get a lt and that’s an important thing to do at Ibrox, to start well.“It was very frustrating but we’ll not be judged by games like away at Ibrox, there will be a lot of big games to come before now and the end of the season.”Woods is also keen to repay the club’s support that has been starved of home success this season with the number of home wins the worst in the ision.“The fans have stuck with us and they were brilliant against Hibs.“I think they can see the performance level has been better in recent weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"embrace title race pressure urges dundee uniteds reynolds","story":"Mark Reynolds says the pressure is only going to increase on Dundee United as the season nears its end but he’s backed the Tangerines to embrace it by running down leaders Ross County.The Staggies have a five-point advantage on Reynolds  Co. going into United’s final  matches of the campaign and the on-loan Aberdeen man expects the intensity to increase game by game in the race to promotion.He said: “You need to embrace the pressure.“If you are in a team that’s got aspirations to go up and compete in the Premiership you need to deal with pressure.“There are players that don’t deal with that but they don’t play in big teams.“We have a good enough dressing-room and boys who want it and are used to playing under pressure in big games.“Everyone has the capability of thriving in it and that’s what we need to do.“We just need to keep on winning. Ross County will just keep doing what they do but the good thing is we play them twice so it can still be in our hands.“If we beat them in those games then it starts to put the pressure on but we still need them to slip up to make up the eight points.“We’ve left ourselves a lot to do but all we can do is win the games in front of us.“Regardless of who it is, every game will be huge and three points will be massive.”After the disappointment of losing Sunday’s Scottish Cup quarter-final against Inverness, United are targeting an immediateto their recent good league form with  points picked up from their last  available.They take on bottom side Partick Thistle this weekend at Firhill and Reynolds has urged the Terrors to “step up” and grab the three points.He added: “It was disappointing on Sunday and the boys were hurting – it’s right we feel that disappointment and let it sink in before getting back to training yesterday and then focus on the league.“We realise that was a chance to get in a semi-final but the next  games will be like cup finals.“There will be pressure, teams will try to stop us, they’ll make it horrible and we’ll be a scalp.“Teams will want to take points off us but we need to deal with that, step up and find ways to beat them.“If we keep winning then the pressure will increase and increase and it’ll get harder and harder but we need to deal with that.“We need to step up and,we do that, then we’ll have a good chance.”After a testing double header against Inverness Caley Thistle last week with a league win followed by that cup defeat, Reynolds expects the Highlanders to be a handful for their semi-final opponents – whether it’s this weekend’s opponents Partick or Premiership Hearts.He said: “Inverness are a big physical team – they put the ball up the park and play off the back of it and they have good players in amongst that.“Last Tuesday I thought we stood up to that and we won more balls, picked up more seconds and did enough to keep them out.“We didn’t do that on Sunday, we were second to too many balls.“Inverness can do that to teams. They will cause problems.”Reynolds, meanwhile, is happy to see no astroturf surfaces on the horizon after missing recent away trips to Queen of the South and Falkirk on physio’s orders.“That’s the last game on plastic pitches so, unless we go to the play-offs and have to play on one it’ll be fine.“It was just too early, that’s me not long back from a cruciate ligament injury so the advice from the physios was not to play on it and not risk it.“They were the guys that got me back so it would be daft not to listen to them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united defender harry souttar called into australian squad","story":"Former Dundee United defender Harry Souttar has been called into the Australia U  squad.The -year-old, who is on loan at Fleetwood Town from current employers Stoke City, has accepted a call-up for Australia’s Olympic qualication squad for their training camp in Malaysia and qualiers in Cambodia.Souttar has already represented Scotland at U  and U  level and, along with brother John, is poised to be the first Scottish siblings to play for dferent countries.John made his international debut last year after Hearts boss Craig Levein warned Scotland risked losing him to Australia because he was eligible to play for the Socceroos.Harry had previously insisted it was his dream to play for Scotland.He#s eligible to play for Australia through his mother, who was born in Australia.He stressed two years ago during Scotland U ’s Elite Round qualiers in Czech Republic he was desperate to play for his country.He said: “My ambition has always been to play for Scotland.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-4-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street must win weekend ahead for dundee and united after disappointments","story":"This week, the Tele#s sports reporters George Cran and Calum Woodger are joined by the newsdesk colleague David Wren as they discuss Dundee United#s trip to Partick and Hearts# visit to play Dundee at Dens Park on Saturday.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years. His work for that competition was recognised by the organisers when he was given a special award at Aviemore along with his friend Donnie MacKenzie of Lochaber.John helped reform Kilmory shinty club in the mid s along with Ian MacPhee, the late Kenny MacRae, Roddy Munro and Alex Campbell. He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella. As a couple they were permanent fixtures at most shinty events in Argyll and well beyond, particularly at events involving young players.Tribute reproduced courtesy of the Camanachd Association"},{"url":null,"title":"casa crew takes the plunge","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTo raise money for to make Heal Scotland a reality, Lilia Sinclair is encouraging everyone to join her to e into Loch Fyne.A dook is scheduled for Saturday March  # with a twist.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end line rnli ayr charity","story":"NewsEnd of the line for RNLI Ayr charity branchThe Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.Share Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsAlicia Watson , Robin Whiteand David Macpherson\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a le-saving charity branch following failed attempts to gain members and volunteers. The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story. Go find the Kingrsquos Chair for yourself and see what your imagination comes up with!"},{"url":null,"title":"double-cash-boost-for-our-community-kitchen-project-in-haddington","story":"Our Community Kitchen has been awarded more than pound,, which it will use over the next year.The bulk of the money has come from Big Lottery Scotland, with pound, awarded to see the group expand to three days a week from next month.Already, the project meets on a Tuesday at Haddington Bowling Club.In the coming weeks, it will also meet on a Wednesday and Thursday, hosting dozens of people at each session and serving a hearty three-course meal for a donation of pound.Elaine Gale, spokeswoman for the project, felt Our Community Kitchen was well on the road to being a success.She said: ldquoIt is so exciting for the area and just to see where we go next.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating. In the end, theyrsquore always smiling.Itrsquos been his busiest year on record and, as Asian weddings continue to evolve, whatrsquos next for Hassan and his team ldquoWersquore seeing people sht away from having weddings in Scotland and opting for destination weddings. Several clients have gone out to Turkey, Dubai, South of France and Italy. Thatrsquos a new, up-and-coming trend, to take all the guests out on a holiday and have all your events out there.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"state-of-scottish-labour-we-need-to-talk-about-richard","story":"His fourth press chief in  months, Ms McMath is said to be a good signing: experienced, likeable, an ideas woman. How is she at miracles, though  Any chance of her turning her hand to the political equivalent of changing water into wine  For that is what Scottish Labour needs as it staggers towards its spring conference in Dundee this weekend.With membership falling, donations down, and impact lessening by the day, the long, slow decline of Scottish Labour continues. The party has become the embarrassing relation of Scottish politics, the one that has to be invited to events because, well, the poor soul does not get out much. They are not doing any harm in the corner, nursing a drink and talking about the old days when vast swathes of Scotland were the colour of the peoplersquos flag.It is a cautionary tale every political party should heed. There is a long list of reasons for the condition Scottish Labour is in, from the partyrsquos arrogance-induced idleness to its inability to adapt to Scotlandrsquos changing political landscape. If we were to go through all the factors in detail we would be here till Christmas , and itrsquos Brexit OrsquoClock already and not a dish washed.Just as a patient at AE undergoes assessment, so the political doctor, spin or otherwise, must zero in on what action needs to be taken immediately, and what can wait. In short, we need to talk about Richard.Richard Leonard  Leader of Scottish Labour  Medium height, grey hair, Tetley tea folk accent, given to wearing red ties  Asks the third question at FMQs  Yes, thatrsquos the one.To appreciate the sorry state of Scottish Labour today one only has to have watched the first instalment of Paul Mitchellrsquos enthralling new documentary Yes No: Inside the Indyref, containing as it did interviews with Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy. It was like the famous graphic showing the evolutionary stages of man, from crouching to upright, but in reverse. Once, Scottish Labour produced future Prime Ministers and Chancellors of the Exchequer. Beginning with Jim Murphy, however, the calibre of leader has been less high office and more David Brent from The Office. No offence to Brent.On the eve of any party conference it is customary for grievances to be aired and tussles take place over the agenda. Conferences are one of the rare times when parties can more or less be guaranteed coverage, evenit is just a line in a radio bulletin. What better time to raise your voice Spin doctor number four for LeonardBut Mr Leonard is now embroiled in not one, not two, but three pre-conference fights. First, his inability to show the faintest leadership in tackling anti-Semitism within the party has been demonstrated, once again, by the rejection of a conference motion demanding ldquorobust disciplinary measures for such behaviour. The Eastwood branch that proposed the motion has been told to submit it to the party conference in September. Good luck with that. So an ideal opportunity to take a strong stand against the toxic racism that has swept up from down south has instead become another own goal for the party.Debating the matter in Dundee would have shown that Mr Leonard was his own man, ready to take steps to distance himself from London when necessary. This has been an unofficial part of the job description of Scottish Labour leader since Johann Lamont quit the post in frustration at London treating the party in Scotland as a ldquobranch office. Mr Leonard, however, seems to go out of his way to give the impression that he and Jeremy Corbyn are as close as two coats of paint, asthis is some kind of recommendation. Any other half-able UK Labour leader would have the party surging ahead of the Conservatives amid the chaos of Brexit. Instead, Labour has become a grisly sideshow, its dithering leader unable to form a position that he can communicate clearly, or get behind fully.Eve of conference bout number two involves Mr Leonard and Gary Smith, the head of Mr Leonardrsquos own trade union, GMB Scotland, for which he worked for more than  years. Mr Smith told The Herald on Sunday that the Scottish Labour leader had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism, and had missed a chance to pick up on Remain sentiment in Scotland by backing a second EU referendum. Attacks by union leaders on Labour politicians are hardly novel , but this one hit home because it summed up general criticism of Mr Leonard.Union chief slates Labour leaderBout number three is the latest one, involving Mr Leonardrsquos predecessor, Kezia Dugdale. As reported by Tom Gordon, political editor of this parish, Ms Dugdale is furious at her partyrsquos leader, accusing him of airbrushing out of history, or rather the conference guide, a statement from former MEP Catherine Stihler supporting a second EU referendum.Ms Dugdale has now lodged a formal complaint about the man who gave her a written warning for running off to join the Irsquom A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here circus instead of serving her constituents in parliament. That last sentence sums Scottish Labour up perfectly for the blend of low farce and mutual recrimination it has become.At this point it would be the done thing to suggest writing Mr Leonardrsquos leadership off as an interesting failure and naming possible replacements. Yet no-one of any serious merit wants the job, for to do so means throwing in their lot with the current leadership in London. What ails Scottish Labour cannot begin to be tackled until the rot stops in London, and it will take a General Election, or a very bad Brexit, to bring that to a head. The peoplersquos party is letting down those most in need of its help. If that does not change soon it will not deserve to exist.Read more: Leonard and Dugdale at war"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils-with-special-needs-facing-traumatic-experiences-in-school","story":"Nick Ward, director of the National Autistic Society Scotland, said the situation had arisen because of a policy that presumes children are better educated in mainstream schools regardless of any learning dficulties or physical impairments.Giving evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos education committee, Mr Ward also warned that budget cuts played their part with councils unable to afford placements in special schools.He said: ldquoWersquove perversely created a system where a child has to fail in a mainstream school to get the specialist place it requires because local authorities donrsquot want to pay for it.

And itrsquos about a lot more these days than merely hunting down the wonky veg on the shelves.According to a recent study by Retail Week and the legal business DWF, nearly half of UK consumers are more concerned about environmental impacts than they were a year before. Some % are now actively shopping with companies promoting ethical or sustainable packages.Modern, green-conscious shoppers know exactly what they want. Their top demands are plastic free produce and packaging, compostable carrier bags, plant-based foods, natural fabric clothes and clothing resale and recycling schemes.The message is clear. Selling sustainably may help the climate and therefore be a good thing in itself, but itrsquos also extremely sound business. In what is currently an extremely tough retail climate, it can be a real dferentiator in attracting customers.To maximise the impact of this growing demand, retailers and social enterprises with a real commitment to sustainable trading need to grow and develop their links with each other.These enterprises, % of which are led by and accountable to local communities, supply a wide range of ethical products, helping to meet demand from the big retail buyers wanting to burnish their green credentials.So therersquos a strong mutual interest in getting it right. To further build links across the industry north of the border, the finance and development organisation Social Investment Scotlandis bringing the two sides together at a residential Retail Academy in Falkirk during May.ldquoEthical products with a social purpose are in much greater demand among consumers across the country, these days, says Alastair Davis, the Chief Executive of SIS. The organisation is itself a charity and social enterprise and has invested pound million in more than  organisations across Scotland since it launched in . This is the third retail academy wersquove run and the previous ones have been a success, he adds.ldquoThe event is about facilitating relationships. We hope that ultimately, social enterprises will be able to secure supply deals and be stocked by the retailers involved.ldquoEssentially, the academy is a pitch ndash a meet-the-buyer process. But as well as that, they have the opportunity to learn from the retailers and receive mentoring and guidance. Early stage social enterprises can then make an informed decision aboutthese are business opportunities they want to pursue.The event might also open up investment opportunities, providing funding to qualying social enterprises. The finance can come from SIS itself or from one of its support programmes. The social enterprises taking part may be able to strike a deal with one of the big retailers involved or take advantage of the mentoring and education they offer.ldquoSomeone may not get a deal but learn a lot about how they can grow their business in other says, explains Alastair Davis. ldquoIf thatrsquos the case, we would be entirely happy with that.ldquoTherersquos a whole raft of evidence showing that consumers are becoming more interested in supply chains and the retailers are aware of that. Itrsquos what shoppers are looking for and it can help to retain business. This sort of event also serves to make retailers more aware of what social enterprises are doing.Social enterprises are now an important part of the Scottish business landscape. A census carried out in  showed there were , such operations north of the border, with a third located in rural areas and almost two thirds ndash % ndash led by women. Total annual income was estimated at pound. billion.One of the highlights of the academy will be a pitching session, where each social enterprise will be invited to explain its products. Retailers will be encouraged to provide their own expert feedback and help each potential supplier refine its pitches for future product listing opportunities.The retailers will also have the opportunity to continue their discussions with inidual enterprises andappropriate to offer product listings in their stores. This yearrsquos main sponsor for the event is the supermarket chain Asda.It has been involved in previous academies and has already established trade relationships with a number of social enterprises including the Edinburgh craft brewery Brewgooder, a supplier that donates all its profits to clean water enterprises. Its lager is now available in more than  supermarkets.Polly Jones, Asdarsquos Corporate Affairs Manager, says that the SIS Retail Academy has been an excellent way for the retail chain to throw its weight behind the social enterprise movement.ldquoWe have also discovered new products which wersquove been able to introduce to our stores across the UK.ldquoBy harnessing the power of our retail experience and expertise alongside our store estate and online shopping ision, we can help social enterprises to enter the large retail market while providing our customers with better access to ethical products.The deadline for social enterprises to apply to take part in the academy, which runs between May  and , is March .--------------------------------------------------------------------Drive forward use of public transportGovernment must help prioritise buses as a sustainable method of travel, says Paul White Deputy Director of CPT UK ScotlandThe Scottish Transport Statistics, published last week, should serve as a wake-up call to those tasked with reducing Scotlandrsquos transport emissions.Bus remains by far the most-used public transport mode with more than  million passenger journeys each year. However, despite heavy investment from operators in new fleet and the latest smart technologies, bus patronage has fallen by % over the past five years.The statistics also show that operating costs per bus journey remain higher in Scotland than the UK average. This, and an % reduction over the past five years in funding from local and national government, has a real impact on the bus industry with consequences for both fares and services.It is not just the commercial bus market that is suffering in this climate. Due to budgetary pressures, some Scottish local authorities have taken the tough decision to end funding for supported bus services altogether.The picture is especially bleak when you consider that delivering air quality improvement by tackling car use is dependent on providing a viable, attractive public transport alternative.A recent KPMG study found that there are many contributing factors to bus patronage decline in Scotland including the low cost of car ownership, increasing congestion, and the growth in online shopping . KPMG concluded that % of the factors that impact on bus patronage are outwith bus companiesrsquo control. As such, coverage which lays blame for patronage decline solely at the feet of bus operators is wideof the mark.Bus companies want to carry more people. However, the bus sector requires political will and brave leadership ndash nationally and locally - to create a supportive framework that prioritises sustainable and active travel. It is  years since John Prescott labelled the bus a workhorse ldquofamiliar, even friendly, but rather dull and unexciting.Sadly, wersquore still fighting that uninformed perception today. More still has to be done to put bus and bus passengers on an equal standing with other modes.Bus passengers can only look on with envy at projects like the refurbishment of Glasgow Queen Street Stationor the delivery of the Subway refurbishment programme . Meanwhile Buchanan Bus Station, responsible for  million bus journeys per annum, is due to be refurbished at the cost of poundk. The disparity in funding between modes is staggering.The Scottish Government will shortly embark on a new Scottish Transport Projects Reviewthis summer. The review will look at means to address government aims around reducing emissions and improving journey times, quality, accessibility and affordability.More grand projects that cater for the car or allocate huge chunks of funding for small but expensive rail schemes are not the answer.I hope the STPR process will acknowledge the importance of the comparatively low-cost infrastructure improvements required to make walking or cycling easier and safer ndash and bus journey times quicker and more reliable. This latter ask could form part of a local Bus Partnership with local operators committing to service improvements in .Meeting Scotlandrsquos air quality targets means getting people out of cars and onto more sustainable modes of transport. Nobody will leave their car behind when therersquos no viable, attractive transport alternative. Providing a framework for bus patronage growth is a key piece in the air quality jigsaw.Hopefully these recent statistics serve their purpose and Scotlandrsquos bus passengers, responsible for % of all public transport trips, become a priority andnot an afterthought within Scotlandrsquos transport policy.------------------------------------------------------------------Project makes world our oysterConservation is the aim of the lsquopound Billion Challengersquo where private, public and non-profit partners drive investment in Scotlandrsquos natural environmentAN ambitious new initiative aims to pioneer new ways of funding nature conservation in Scotland through the launch of the pound Billion Challenge.Led by the Scottish Wildle Trust and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , the Scottish Conservation Finance Project aims to generate new forms of investment in Scotlandrsquos stocks of natural capital in ways that will deliver signicant environmental, social and economic benefits, as well as s for investors.Natural capital can be defined as the worldrsquos stocks of natural assets which include geology, soil, air, water and all living things.The project brings together organisations from the private, public and non-profit sectors to develop cutting-edge investment and funding models for large-scale nature conservation activities, for example planting native woodlands, restoring oyster reefs and creating urban green spaces.ldquoGlobally, investment in nature needs to increase substantially to meet the growing challenges posed by climate change and bioersity loss, says Jonny Hughes, Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.ldquoScotland was among the first nations in the world to pledge support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and has been at the forefront of a number of pioneering environmental initiatives, including the World Forum on Natural Capital.ldquoThe aim of this new initiative is to provide a practical opportunity to come together, exchange ideas and collectively achieve a lasting impact. Ultimately we want to begin to drive billions of pounds of investment into Scottish conservation in the coming years.According to a  report by Credit Suisse AG and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, an estimated - billion per year is needed globally to preserve healthy ecosystems on land and in the oceans. Currently only around  billion is available per year, mostly in the form of public and philanthropic funds.Terry ArsquoHearn, Chief Executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said: ldquoIn Scotland, we currently using the resources of three planets, but only have one.ldquoGood leaders say ndash therersquos only one planet, we have to work within it. But great leaders say ndash how do we turn this from a threat into an opportunity for our organisation  The Scottish Conservation Finance Project is an exciting opportunity to bring the right people together to meet this challenge.The pound billion Challenge was showcased in London last week at the Natural Capital Investment Conference at the Royal Society, following its successful launch in Edinburgh in early February."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-dismisses-idea-of-wildcat-independence-referendum-at-fmqs","story":"It comes after Keith Brown, the SNP depute leader, suggested that a referendum could occur evenit was rejected by the UK Government.:SNP deputy leader Keith Brown backs wildcat IndyrefKeith Brown said:ldquoIf we want to have a referendum, then we decide wersquore going to have a referendum. and that Brexit could becomeldquonormalisedthe Yes movement ldquodidnrsquot go relatively soon for independence.However, the idea of such a referendum seemed to be dismissed by Nicola Sturgeon at FMQs.When quizzed by opposition during First Ministers Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said:\"The legal basis for the next independence referendum should be the same as the basis for the last independence referendum.\"And the only reason were talking about this issue is the disgracefully anti-democratic stance of the Conservatives, who refuse to recognise a mandate at two elections and endorsed by this Parliament.\"When responding to claims that the SNP were obsessed with the idea of a second independence referendum, the First Minister said:\"Let me tell Jackson Carlaw what my obsession is right now.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

It is shameful that it has taken a fiasco like this for the Scottish Government to sit up and take notice.\"Thankfully, the mother and both babies are healthy and we must thank the local NHS staff for their excellent work.\"However, this is a situation that neither the mother nor the staff should have been put in and we desperately need action from the Scottish Government.\"Geography and distance should not be something expectant mothers have to deal with and the government must accept that no-one should lack access to health services simply because of where they live.\"He spoke out after the womans ordeal was made public. She went to Caithness General Hospital in Wick in November after her waters broke when she was  weeks pregnant.It was decided she should go by ambulance to Raigmore in Inverness, over  miles away, to have her babies.But as she was near Golspie, her contractions became stronger and she was taken to the local community hospital, the Lawson Memorial, where she gave birth to a boy.A helicopter was then to take the woman to the Highland capital but was unable to land due to frost on its propellers so she made the rest of the journey by ambulance and gave birth to the second twin.Labours Rhoda Grant raised the case in parliament and claimed the air ambulance should have been called when the woman went into labour.She asked: \"It begs the question why was the air ambulance or emergency retrieval team not tasked initially to airlt the mum from Caithness \"Will the First Minister investigate this and will she make sure that the air ambulance treats situations like this as a priority \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to investigate and asked Scotlands health secretary, Jeane Freeman, to look into it.Bill Fernie, the chairman of Chat, said the case highlighted the groups concerns about mothers having to travel to Inverness to give birth.\"Fortunately, we have not had a tragedy yet and hopefully we never will ndash but this underlines the fears we have had since the changes were made to the local maternity unit.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Universal Credit rate, which would be applicable for new mixed age couple applicants, is around £ a week. The dference is around £ a year for those on the lowest incomes.The move was quietly announced through a Written Ministerial statement on a busy Brexit vote day in the UK Parliament in January. The new changes will go in effect on th May .: Pensioner poverty rate higher in Scotland than rest of UKUntil now, mixed age couples will be able to choose whether they claim Pension Credit or working age benefits. However, from th May, a couple will have to wait until they both reach their State Pension Age in order to claim Pension Credit.Those who are not able to be on Pension Credit will also lose out on cold weather payments, housing benefit, Council Tax Reduction, social fund funeral payments and may not be entitled to the warm home discount.: Pensions review launch to boost pots for retirement Commenting on the new policy, Age Scotland’s Chief Executive, Brian Sloan said: “This outrageous new policy will have a devastating impact to Scotland’s poorest pensioners and will make older couples of mixed age poorer for living together. When the move was announced the UK Government did not know how many people it would impact. Weeks later it emerged that it would impact , people in  , , the following year and , the year after that, but still no official assessment for Scotland.“We estimate that at least  of the poorest pensioners in Scotland will be hit next year and double that the following year. It’s not acceptable.“The health of Scotland’s most vulnerable pensioners will be harmed as they struggle to pay bills and heat their homes all because of an out-of-touch policy.“Right now, four in ten pensioner couples have dficulty paying their fuel bills and % of people over the age of  are financially squeezed.

How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak.

I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much.

So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

He said: \"We are sure the administrators will do all they can to try and ensure that creditors, particularly small local companies, are promptly paid.\"Badenoch MSP Kate Forbessaid: \"This shows once again how critically important Cairngorm Mountain is to the wider strath. Thats also why its such a relief the resort has a future with operators that appreciate the local impact.\"I can fully understand why there will be concerns amongst local businesses as they await the outcome of this process. I regularly ask HIE for updates to ensure the local community and economy are front and centre of all decisions they make.\"Regional MSP Edward Mountainsaid: \"I am hugely disappointed that businesses in the Highlands have been left out of pocket and this matter should be investigated fully.\"I strongly believe that the management structure of Cairngorm Mountain that has been used in recent years is not fit for purpose.\"A spokesman for Campbell Dallas, said investigating the conduct of directors is a statutory requirement in every insolvency. He commented: \"The content of the conductsubmitted to the Insolvency Service must remain confidential. As such, the joint administrators are unable to comment any further.\"The Strathy tried to contact Natural Retreats but got no response.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious ballymena firm invests 300k","story":"Ballymena printing firm, Ballyprint has scored a Northern Ireland first after investing in Xerox#s new Iridesse Production Press.The investment is part of an ambitious plan to grow the company following a major boost of £k, in new state of the art digital printing and finishing equipment.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

Likewise, the countdown to Cheltenham begins in earnest for local punters after the hugely-popular Sean Graham preview night at Belfast’s Europa Hotel.This year’s top table included the top trainer from last year’s Festival Gordon Elliott along with David Casey, assistant trainer to his rival Willie Mullins.Noel Meade’s stable jockey Sean Flanagan joined the line up along with Mark ‘The Couch’ Winstanley , Richard Hoiles , Gary O’Brienwhile Bookmakers Brian and Ronan Grahamwere on hand to provide the latest odds and give their insights.If the  of experts are to believed, Clan Des Obeaux, an impressive winner of the King George, won’t be winning this year’s Gold Cup, or any other Gold Cup for that matter.Last year’s RSA Chase hero Presenting Percy was the almost unanimous selection from the top table. There was a good each-way shout for Elliott’s Shattered Love , but the Co Meath trainer insisted he’d love to be training Presenting Percy. David Casey was keen on whatever Mullins aims at the race , but cautioned that he wouldn’t back last year’s winner Native River “with stolen money” following his below-par efforts this season.Elliott appears to have great chance of landing the feature on Day One with the brilliant mare Apple’s Jade.Without giving too much away, he added that he “couldn’t be happier” with Apple’s Jade, who is four from four this season.Defending champion Buveur D’Air was friendless at the top table while Casey reported Laurina to be in rude health, but stressed that she would need to improve on her form having won a weak Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle in .Brain Graham feels the seven-pound Mare’s allowance will be a key factor and thinks Apple’s Jade will prevail.Altior , unsurprisingly, was an almost universal tip to retain the Champion Chase with only Winstanley opting for second-favourite Min .If Buveur D’Air was largely opposed by the  in the Champion Hurdle, Stayers’ Hurdle ante-post favourite Paisley Parkwas described as the lay of the meeting by bookmaker Ronan Graham.The  seemed keen to take on the favourite with the reliable Supasundaeand Faugheen . Casey stated that the former Champion Hurler was in great form at home and that, given his brilliant record at Cheltenham, he’d take a bit of beating.Elsewhere, the  seemed agreed that Champhas plenty to do to live up to his name in the Ballymore Novices’ Hurdle, but they think leading owner JP McManus is likely to gain compensation in the Triumph Hurdle with the well-bred Sir Ereclikely to go off odds-on for the first race on Friday.Indeed, Elliott described Joseph O’Brien’s runner as a “good thing” and few were willing to disagree with that assessment.For those looking better value, Band of Outlawswas touted as a potential winner of the Fred Winter Hurdle while Dinosand Sams Profilewere put up as each-way punts for the Albert Bartlett Novices Hurdle.Personally, my favourite race of the Festival is the Stayer’s Hurdle.My first punt ahead of this year’s Festival is Kilbricken Storm each-way at  .

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

not be able to deliver the changes she promised to her failed Brexit deal.“This speech looks set to be an admission of failure.”International Trade Secretary Dr Fox urged Tory Brexiteers to rally behind the deal in order to ensure the UK does break away from Brussels.“The thing that I fear is that there will be … a risk that we might not deliver Brexit at all,” he told BBC’s Newsnight.“In Parliament there are a large number of MPs who do not see it as their primary objective to deliver on the referendum and would want to keep us locked to the European Union.”In a message to fellow Brexiteers, he added: “You can never allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good, many of us have made compromises throughout this process.“The quicker we can rally behind a common position that shows we have a united front in terms of how we want to approach the future, the better.”“If you come back and ask essentially the same question, logic suggests you’ll get pretty much the same answer”

there was clear frustration on the EU side, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly complaining that Mr Cox had produced “a legal solution to a political problem” and France’s Europe minister

put forward ideas for a ring-fenced NHS tax, a new model of “public benefit companies” to run utilities and services and means-testing of university tuition fees.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Independent Group MPs held talks with the Electoral Commission on Tuesday about becoming a fully-fledged political party The Streatham MP, the group spokesman for TIG, stressed that his policy pamphlet was written in a personal capacity and was not a manesto.But he said all members of the -strong TIG “share the same values and principles I have set out, and agree with much of what I have written”.Under his proposal for a “citizens’ service”, Mr Umunna acknowledged that “it might seem strong medicine” but was necessary to tackle “social apartheid” in modern Britain.He said national service, which ended in the early s, “brought people from an array of dferent backgrounds and dferent parts of the country together in a way like no other”.To tackle this social apartheid we need to be prepared to take radical action, evenat first it might seem strong medicineChuka UmunnaFacebookTwitterMr Umunna said his proposal could build on the National Citizen Service scheme introduced by David Cameron, which “has suffered by being voluntary”.It could also draw on evidence from France, where Emmanuel Macron made a national service requirement for -year-olds a key policy, with trials beginning this year.“What we mustn’t do, in a fit of national cynicism, is dismiss the idea of bringing young people together and trying to at least start breaking down the social silos that are such a scar on our society,” Mr Umunna said.Other measures put forward in the pamphlet for the Progressive Centre UK think tank include:– Supporting students going to university from poor backgrounds by means-testing tuition fees and reintroducing maintenance grants– Equalising tax rates on unearned idends and income from work, using the proceeds to fund universal childcare– Introducing more comprehensive state funding for political parties– Moving Parliament out of the Palace of Westminster and replacing the Lords with an elected chamber.Mr Umunna said: “It is time we dump this country’s old-fashioned politics and create a new politics that does justice to who we are today and gives this country a politics fit for the st century, not the last one.“A politics that looks, listens and learns from ideas and experience where in the world to better inform the course we take at home.”TIG has eight former Labour MPs including Mr Umunna and three ex-Tories.In a call for more to join them, Mr Umunna said: “The truth is too many progressive people are sitting in parties which, through those parties’ words and deeds, are no longer true to their values.“This leads to the inescapable conclusion that our politics needs to be reconfigured to better reflect modern Britain and that it is time for the dferent progressive political traditions to come together under one roof – a new progressive party.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv captures moment rare baby giraffe is born at chester zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

During last week’s public testimony, he called Mr Trump a con man, a cheat and a racist.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President Donald Trump has accused his former lawyer Michael Cohen of lying Mr Trump, in turn, has said Cohen “did bad things unrelated to Trump” and “is lying in order to reduce his prison time”.In his statement on Thursday, Mr Davis said when he was brought on to Cohen’s legal team in June, his client “authorised me as a new lawyer to say publicly Mr Cohen would never accept a pardon from President Trump evenoffered”.“That continues to be the case,” Mr Davis said. “And his statement at the Oversight Hearing was true — and consistent with his post-joint defence agreement commitment to tell the truth.”Politicians have requested information about talks on possible pardons for Cohen and other defendants close to the president who have become entangled in Mr Mueller’s investigation. He is investigating possible co-ordination between Russia and Mr Trump’s  presidential campaign.Cohen is headed to prison in May after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and other crimes.Federal prosecutors have said Mr Trump directed Cohen to arrange payments to buy the silence of two women — porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal — who had alleged they had sex with Mr Trump.

With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced. On Monday night, this recommendation was overturned by  votes to .Mournes SDLP councillor Laura Devlin, who initially proposed to explore the merits of a pop-up beach, said the local authority ldquoneeds to think outside the box to create an articial beach or ldquosimply accept that Newcastle will never have a sandy beach.She continued: ldquoIf improving the natural beach was an option I would obviously proceed in that direction. However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Penalties settle derby cup tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic set up a Clarence Cup quarter-final clash away to Comber Rec, but they had to do it the hard way at Kilmore Road on Saturday.The biting cold wind and rain turned this derby clash into a lottery which went to a penalty shoot-out that ended in total controversy.Olympic held a slight advantage at - on penalties when Kilmore goalkeeper Darren Ross threw his side a leline after he brilliantly saved Niall Murrayrsquos spot kick.This was no more than Kilmore deserved, but their players and supporters quickly became incandescent with rage when the referee insisted that Ross had moved off his line and ordered the spot kick to be taken again.Murray made no mistake at the second attempt and blasted Olympic into the last eight as Kilmore were left to rue what might have been.Olympic played with the swirling, gusting wind in their backs in the first half, but Matty Hardy and Jack Larkin at the heart of the Kilmore defence looked calm and composed.Olympic were struggling to get the ball down in the middle of the park and play their normal passing game as Kilmorersquos Michael Monan and Anton McGrattanrsquos forced Stevie and Ryan Noade into hurried passes.However, with  minutes gone Murray used the wind to his advantage.Olympic were awarded a free kick just inside the Kilmore half and out on the line beside their own dugout. Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However, simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it.\"The Government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this House can support.\"There was uproar in the chamber as she said: \"There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy. But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.\"Mrs May said she would seek \"legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

deal.MPs will vote on Tuesday on whether to back the Withdrawal Agreement as Mrs May seeks further concessions on the Northern Ireland backstop in order to reverse the humiliating -vote defeat suffered the last time the Commons passed judgment on her Brexit deal.Mrs Mayrsquos call for action from the EU came as Cabinet minister Liam Fox warned that Brexit might not happen at all unless MPs get behind the deal.The Prime Minister will use a speech in Leave-voting Grimsby to say the Government remains determined to secure legally binding changes to the backstop, and will urge the EU to agree.ldquoJust as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too, she will say.ldquoWe are both participants in this process.ldquoIt is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal.ldquoWe are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ldquoItrsquos becoming increasingly clear that Theresa May will not be able to deliver the changes she promised to her failed Brexit deal.ldquoThis speech looks set to be an admission of failure.International Trade Secretary Dr Fox urged Tory Brexiteers to rally behind the deal in order to ensure the UK does break away from Brussels.ldquoThe thing that I fear is that there will be hellip a risk that we might not deliver Brexit at all, he told BBCrsquos Newsnight.ldquoIn Parliament there are a large number of MPs who do not see it as their primary objective to deliver on the referendum and would want to keep us locked to the European Union.In a message to fellow Brexiteers, he added: ldquoYou can never allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good, many of us have made compromises throughout this process.ldquoThe quicker we can rally behind a common position that shows we have a united front in terms of how we want to approach the future, the better.ldquoIf you come back and ask essentially the same question, logic suggests yoursquoll get pretty much the same answer ndash deputy chair of the European Research Group Mark Francois tells

through the weekend in a frantic effort to break the deadlock over the backstop measures, which are aimed at preventing a hard border with Irelandno alternative trading arrangements are in place.The European Commission confirmed ldquotechnical talks were continuing and said president Jean-Claude Juncker was ldquoavailable   to meet Mrs Maya deal was close.In the Commons, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox ndash who has been leading for the UK in the latest negotiations ndash said the talks would ldquoalmost certainly carry on through the weekend.\"Stephen Barclay and Geoffrey Cox are expected to

by Monday ndash the day before the vote.Number  is believed to hope a deal can be reached by Sunday night, with the possibility of the Prime Minister travelling to Brussels on Monday morning to meet Mr Juncker.Ministers were said to be braced for another heavy defeat on Tuesday after the previous ldquomeaningful vote was lost by a majority of , with many MPs deeply unhappy about the backstop.Mr Cox told MPs he was continuing to press for legally binding changes to the backstop that would ensure the UK could not be tied indefinitely to EU rules.He rejected claims that the Government had again failed to come forward with concrete proposals, insisting there had been ldquofocused, detailed and careful discussions.However there was clear frustration on the EU side, with chief negotiator Michel

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
