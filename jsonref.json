I couldn’t bear the thought of him not going to a loving home.‘He was a little nervous at first but now he has completely settled in. He has been really good. He is very feisty and full of life. Everyone loves him.‘He is a little bit frightened of people but he is very loving towards people he knows and feels comfortable around.’(Picture: Joanna RoseFortitude Press)After adopting Bruno, Frankie got some adorable photographs taken by Joanna Rose Photography in Liverpool, Merseyside, of him wearing snuggly jumpers, party hats, a rabbit costume and even a superman cape.Frankie, a PA, said: ‘The photos are lovely. He looks so cute. Everybody seems to really like them. We got them for his own social media account and to display around the house.‘We have had photographs taken of our other dogs before and I couldn’t wait to get some of Bruno.’(Picture: Joanna RoseFortitude Press)Due to his cleft lip, Bruno couldn’t eat solid food for the first two weeks of his life and now has to eat out of shallow bowls so he doesn’t inhale anything.Frankie said: ‘The cleft lip doesn’t really impact his life.

He doesn’t act any different to the other dogs.MORE: National Pet Day: How many pets are there in the UK?MORE: Chunky dog Hattie who couldn’t stop eating burgers raises enough money to have life-changing tummy tuck surgery"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-944887132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;h=409\u0026amp;crop=1\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo interrupts interview to hug Gianluigi Buffon after Real Madrid vs Juve\" class=\"img-align-none size-full wp-image-7460095\" data-rewritten=\"true","title":"cristiano ronaldo interrupts interview hug gianluigi buffon real madrid vs juve","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo interrupted Gianluigi Buffon’s interview to hug the Juventus legend.

We’ve pretty much accepted that we’re doomed to rent forever.But rather than throwing £800 a month at the problem, there could be another solution to your property-related woes… if you’re lucky.A couple are raffling off their stunning £600,000 four-bedroom property for just £5 a ticket.As well as covering the cost of the home, Marty Pumbien and Annie Brown hope the raffle will raise money for research into dementia.The house is pretty snazzy, coming in at 2,500 square feet of living space and sitting on Abington Park Crescent in Northampton, right next to a large park.(Picture: SWNS)There are four double bedrooms, – three of which have en suite bathrooms – a state of the art kitchen, three reception rooms, a study, a utility room, and a back garden.It’s the little details that count: Exposed brick fireplaces, heated floors, and a whirlpool spa bath and waterfall shower in the main bathroom. Dreamy.The raffle is now open to entries, and the winner will be announced on 14 October. If you fancy trying your luck with a £5 ticket, you can buy a try on the home’s website.(Picture: SWNS)You’ll need to answer a question about Northampton correctly to be in with a chance of winning. Oh, and you can enter as many times as you want.‘It all sounds a bit mad but when you think about it, it’s a bit loopy but it’s a chance to make a difference,’ says Marty.‘It’s an idea we had a couple of years ago and I was chatting to the missus about it and she gave me a slap and told me not to be so stupid and move on.(Picture: SWNS)‘But I started looking at doing some proper investigation work into it and eventually she came around to the idea.‘It is quite a minefield legally, the terms and conditions, getting round the legalities of the gambling, all that kind of stuff – it’s been a bit of a headache but we got there in the end.‘We’re both nurses and we have 40 years of experience between us of A\u0026ampE and we see dementia patents all the time.(Picture: SWNS)‘The lack of support and facilities for them is scary really, especially in A\u0026ampE where the conditions are worse.‘I see it in the community a lot as well now – if they have mild dementia they can live on their own and have a bit of help but they’re locked in their own homes.‘We sorted out the legalities, got talking to the university through our solicitors about their scheme and what they’re looking to do – they have loads of ideas but a lack of funding.(Picture: SWNS)‘We are used to helping people on a day-to-day and one-by-one basis, doing it this way we can actually help an entire community in one go.’The couple hope to sell 500,000 tickets, which will generate £2.5million if all of the tickets are bought. They’ll give £1million to the dementia research fund run by the University of Northampton, and the Northamptonshire Community Foundation will match the funds.(Picture: SWNS)The couple will take £800,000 to cover the cost of the house and the fees associated with selling it.Marty said: ‘It is a massive house and there’s only me, the missus and a small dog.‘We refurbished it – it was all intended for children but it turns out we can’t have children.‘A lot of the house for us has become redundant, it needs a family – four double beds, three en-suites, walk-in showers, whirl baths, the whole kit and caboodle.(Picture: SWNS)‘The whole top floor, we never go up there – the two double beds on the top floor with en-suites, we never go up there.‘It’s not so much about why should you buy a ticket, but rather why not?‘We used to live in Manchester so we’re contemplating going there next.’MORE: Homelessness and mental health: what’s being done to help?MORE: Is this beauty membership club the new alternative to subscription boxes?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/sei_18090144.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"im excited about the royal wedding but not because of all the pomp and circumstance","story":"I can’t wait for these two to tie the knot (Picture: WireImage)I’m excited to watch the coverage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding on 19 May.In fact, I have been a royalist for many years now.In 2012, when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got married, I, alongside most of the country, was glued to the action as the Duchess in her exquisite wedding gown walked into Westminster Abbey.Whether, like me, you watched at home while eating scones with cream and jam, or you were in the Mall waving a flag, it was like being part of a real life fairy tale, as well as being a significant event in our country’s history.The last royal wedding provided much needed cheer, ceremony, unity, street parties and joy to millions across our nation.Of course there will be those who believe the royal family are of little or no importance, who don’t deserve their vast wealth and should be abolished.As a British teenager in the late 90s and early 2000s, growing up with a lot of negativity about the royals, I too did not see any point to them.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had always had an amazing work ethic and so did Prince Charles, who should be applauded for his work with the Prince’s Trust.But I could never fully understand, as the granddaughter of immigrants to this country, why the royals were so important, and why they had so much, when so many people did not.I still struggle with this.However, as I got older, the new generation of the house of Windsor – my generation – changed my opinion on them.The young generation of royals do amazing work (Picture: Chris JacksonPool via AP)HRH Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, alongside Prince Harry, began to embrace wider causes for those who were marginalised.They founded the mental health charity Heads Together and raise millions for it each year.They are patrons of charities including Centrepoint for the homeless, Sentebale, Prince Harry’s charity for those affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana, and they’ve helped veterans by launching the Invictus Games.They always speak eloquently and they actively make a positive impact on society, supporting those who are disadvantaged and helping to bring about change.They are more relatable to people of my generation, and they embrace the public and work tirelessly on our behalf.The royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be a joyous occasion.Meghan is a UN ambassador for women and girls and with her new husband will continue in her campaigning work.It is notable that for their wedding they have not asked for presents, but charitable gifts, listing seven charities.Kensington Palace said in a statement: ‘The couple have chosen charities which represent a range of issues that they are passionate about, including sport for social change, women’s empowerment, conservation, the environment, homelessness, HIV and the Armed Forces.‘Many of these are small charities, and the couple are pleased to be able to amplify and shine a light on their work.’So this is why I am excited about this royal wedding. It may be a smaller occasion than Will and Kate’s, but it will bring much needed smiles to a lot of people’s faces.In times of trouble for our country and world wide, a love story can bring a fleeting smile or even joy .I, for one, am looking forward to it.MORE: Happy birthday Prince Harry!

Debbie Dingell (left) pointed out how many things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (right) didn\u0027t seem to know about his own website           Rep. Ben Ray Luján told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he didn\u0027t like how non-users would have to sign up for a Facebook page in order to see what the social network had scooped up about them Luján took issue with the practice because non-users currently had to sign up for Facebook if they wanted to see what data of theirs the social network collected. \u0027You\u0027ve said everyone controls their data, by you\u0027re collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement,\u0027 Luján said, encouraging Zuckerberg to fix the problem. During the five-hour hearing, the Facebook CEO revealed that his own personal data had been included when 87 million or so Facebook users had their data improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered when asked by Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, whether his data was included in the data sold to malicious third parties. \u0027Your personal data?\u0027 Eshoo clarified.  But he pushed back on  suggestions from the members of the House of Representatives that users do not have enough control of their data on Facebook in the wake of the privacy scandal at the world\u0027s largest social media network.\u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 he said.\u0027Not buried in the settings somewhere but right there,\u0027 the 33-year-old internet magnate told the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.          Push back: \u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 Zuckerberg said to the House Energy and Commerce Committee    Facebook CEO is swarmed by photographers as he arrives to testify before House members on Wednesday            No boost for Zuck: The Facebook CEO was back in a regular chair after he got an extra cushion on Tuesday when he appeared in front of the Senate joint committee  The way he was: How Zuckerberg got a boost as he testified to the Senate joint committee on Tuesday           In one of the odder moments of the day, Rep. Michael Burgess made a point to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) using a Dilbert cartoon about \u0027terms and conditions\u0027           Rep. Michael Burgess also shared the cartoon on Twitter explaining that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data\u0027 Once again wearing a dark suit instead of his usual gray T-shirt, the hearing was Zuckerberg\u0027s second in two days. CONGRESSMAN BRINGS DILBERT CARTOON TO FACEBOOK HEARING Beyond Cambridge Analytica, lawmakers asked questions Wednesday about Facebook\u0027s terms of use, and if the social network censored certain types of political speech.  Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, brought along with him a vintage Dilbert cartoon to make a point about Facebook\u0027s \u0027terms and conditions.\u0027  \u0027I consulted my technology consultant Scott Adams, in the form of Dilbert,\u0027 Burgess said. The cartoon strip shows Dilbert telling Dogbert, \u0027I didn\u0027t read all of my shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it. Apparently I agreed to spend the rest as a towel boy in Bill Gates\u0027 new mansion.\u0027  \u0027Call your lawyer,\u0027 recommends the small white cartoon dog.  \u0027Too late, he opened software yesterday. Now he\u0027s Bill\u0027s laundry boy,\u0027 Dilbert responded, referencing Microsoft\u0027s CEO. Burgess\u0027 broader point, which he articulated in a tweet, is that too few Americans read the \u0027terms and conditions,\u0027 adding that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data.\u0027 ZUCKERBERG ASKED ABOUT FACEBOOK PREDECESSOR \u0027FACEMASH\u0027  Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, deployed an interesting line of questioning, asking Zuckerberg about the origins of \u0027Facemash\u0027 and if it was still up and running. \u0027No, congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,\u0027 Zuckerberg replied. \u0027There was a movie about this, it says it was about this, of unclear truth, and the claim that Facemash was somehow connected to the development of Facebook, it isn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 the CEO continued, referencing the 2010 movie, \u0027The Social Network.\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that he created that website in 2003. \u0027It actually has nothing do to with Facebook,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you put up pictures of women and decide which one was the better, the more attractive of the two, is that right?\u0027 Long asked. Zuckerberg said that was right. \u0027Congressman, that is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was sophomore in college,\u0027 the CEO said, as Long made comments about the website\u0027s beginnings.           After asking about Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s \u0027Facemash\u0027 website, Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, brought up perceived bias against Trump-supporting sisters, Diamond and Silk          Rep. Billy Long even went as far as to have an aide hold up a picture of the two women and asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who they were. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 the 33-year-old CEO answered LAWMAKERS FIXATE ON DIAMOND AND SILK CONTROVERSYLong then asked staff to hold up a large photograph and asked Zuckerberg to describe who was pictured. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 Zuckerberg asked. Long said it was. \u0027That is Diamond and Silk, two biological sisters from North Carolina, I might point out they\u0027re African-American, and their content was deemed by your folks to be unsafe,\u0027 Long said. \u0027Diamond and Silk have a question for you. And that question is, What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\u0027 he continued. A number of Republican lawmakers asked Zuckerberg questions about the Trump-supporting sisters over his two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. \u0027Well Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\u0027 Zuckerberg answered.  Facebook acknowledged sending a message to the sisters, prominent conservative video bloggers, deeming their content \u0027unsafe,\u0027 but the social network said the contents of the message were \u0027inaccurate.\u0027 \u0027We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,\u0027 Facebook\u0027s spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said. In front of lawmakers, Zuckerberg was caught flat-footed, as the Diamond and Silk situation had developed over the past several days. \u0027The specifics of this situation I am not as up to speed on as I would be,\u0027 Zuckerberg told Long.   Other Republicans brought up the Diamond and Silk incident to ask the Facebook co-founder questions about political bias. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, deployed that line of questioning on Tuesday.  \u0027There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\u0027 Cruz said. \u0027There have been numerous instances with Facebook.\u0027  Rep. Joe Barton, another Texas Republican, held up his phone and told Zuckerberg he was going to ask him a question that someone had submitted to the congressman\u0027s Facebook account. \u0027First question: Please ask Mr. Zuckerberg, why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them unsafe to the community. That is absurd. They hold conservative views. That isn\u0027t unsafe,\u0027 Barton said reading the question, and adding his own, \u0027What\u0027s your response?\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that his team had made \u0027an enforcement error.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027ve already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,\u0027 he said, referring to Diamond and Silk. Later on in the hearing Wednesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican running for Senate, asked whether free speech is being censored by the site.Zuckerberg used the example of terrorism, as the types of posts that would be pulled from Facebook. \u0027Let me tell you right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism,\u0027 Blackburn scoffed.  WALL STREET INVESTORS LOVE ZUCK On Tuesday, Zuckerberg took questions for nearly five hours in a Senate hearing without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business, foiling attempts by senators to pin him down. Investors were impressed with his initial performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years on Tuesday, closing up 4.5 percent. They were down 0.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday Zuckerberg\u0027s testimony further bolstered investors\u0027 views of the company, with the CEO\u0027s performance leading them to believe that the company would weather the storm surrounding Cambridge Analytica.   Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u0027 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted President Trump\u0027s election campaign among its clients.Zuckerberg faced broad concerns from members of Congress about how Facebook shares user data.          A number of lawmakers have complained over Facebook\u0027s treatment of Diamond and Silk, prominent Trump supporters, which the company has said it\u0027s remedying  Lawmaker turns on Zuckerberg telling him \u0027as CEO you didn\u0027t...Dow Jones drops 200 points as markets get jittery over...Zuckerberg warns of ¿arms race¿ with Russian trolls who will...Facebook launches \u0027bug bounty\u0027 program offering up to...Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are sued by British and US...Zuckerberg is quizzed repeatedly on perceived left-wing bias...Share this article    Back in the hot seat: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned Wednesday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee after a joint committee of the Senate had questioned him on Tuesday\u0027How can consumers have control over their data when Facebook does not have control over the data?\u0027 asked Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce committee.The latest estimate of affected users is up to 87 million.Patience with the social network had already worn thin among users, advertisers and investors after the company said last year that Russia used Facebook for years to try to sway U.S. politics, an allegation Moscow denies.Lawmakers have sought assurances that Facebook can effectively police itself, and few came away from Tuesday\u0027s hearing expressing confidence in the social network.\u0027I don\u0027t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God, I will,\u0027 Republican Senator John Kennedy told Zuckerberg on Tuesday. \u0027A lot of that depends on you.\u0027Zuckerberg deflected requests to support specific legislation. Pressed repeatedly by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey to endorse a proposed law that would require companies to get people\u0027s permission before sharing personal information, Zuckerberg agreed to further talks.\u0027In principle, I think that makes sense, and the details matter, and I look forward to having our team work with you on fleshing that out,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.But those qualms didn\u0027t rattle Wall Street as Zuckerberg testified that despite the #DeleteFacebook movement, the number of uses of the website hasn\u0027t gone down significantly.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Man Booker Prize 2018 festival lineup revealed","story":"What is FaceMash?

Sources told the magazine that Barris is looking to go to Netflix, which recently signed former ABC powerhouse Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure contracts.It may be difficult for Barris to get out of his contract, since he just signed a four-year deal with the network last year. And sources told Variety that the network is not interested in losing one of their top talents. While Rhimes also left early, she only had a year left in her contract and ABC agreed to release her.Barris\u0027 alleged dissatisfaction with the network, where he has worked since 2015, may have to do with executives pulling a \u0027racially-charged\u0027 episode of Black-ish last month, which dealt with the NFL national anthem kneeling protest.

She was named the 2007 young Australian Muslim of the year.She has been an prominent advocate for Muslim women, but attracted controversy in Australia over an Anzac Day tweet juxtaposing attitudes towards the Anzac legend with Australian and international policies towards refugees.She is based in London.The Guardian has attempted to speak directly with Abdel-Magied.Chief executive of PEN America Suzanne Nossel said she was dismayed by Abdel-Magied’s sudden deportation. “The very purpose of the PEN World Voices Festival, founded after 911 to sustain the connectedness between the US and the wider world, is in jeopardy at a time when efforts at visa bans and tightened immigration restrictions threaten to choke off vital channels of dialogue that are protected under the First Amendment right to receive and impart information through in-person cultural exchange.”Nossel said Abdel-Magied was travelling on her Australian passport. “We understand that Yassmin was traveling on a type of visa that she had used in the past for similar trips without issue. We call on Customs and Border Patrol to admit her to the US so that she can take her rightful place in the urgent international conversation to take place at the festival next week.”A spokeswoman for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it was aware an Australian citizen had been refused entry to the US.“Like Australia, the United States administers a strict entry regime. The decision on who can enter the United States is a matter solely for the US Government.”Australia’s citizenship and multicultural affairs minister, Alan Tudge, said similarly, US visas were a decision for the American government.“I just don’t know the details underpinning this and whether or not it was that she had a tourist visa, that perhaps there was evidence she was planning to do other things other than being a tourist there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a982bdda5c7b4541008813d86af14234677aa92/0_127_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=86e0273fdb547223c67d86f07dc03728 1240w","title":"the good friday agreement is a shibboleth","story":"The shadow trade secretary has apologised for his misuse of the word. But what does it mean? An ear of corn? A stream in flood? A way of identifying enemies?It was reported this week that the shadow trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, had called the Good Friday agreement a “shibboleth”. Critics pounced on social media, complaining that Gardiner didn’t know what the word meant. But did anyone?Shibboleth is the Hebrew for either “ear of corn” or “stream in flood”. In the Bible, Jephthah uses the word to identify his enemies, the Ephraimites, because they can’t pronounce the “sh”. Hence a “shibboleth” became a test-word to identify members of an in-group, and then a custom or habit specific to a group. Since the 1930s, however, “shibboleth” has also meant simply an outdated view, probably deriving from the original sense via the idea of an opinion held by tribal custom rather than by reasoning.Gardiner himself apologised for causing a “misunderstanding” and creating “the impression that I thought the Good Friday agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant”. Since that is the only thing he could possibly have meant, it is unclear just who had misunderstood what. Perhaps total avoidance of the word “shibboleth” should be a shibboleth for future members of the shadow cabinet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7fd6ca8228d666efb528b5117a76bdf53ccdd6/0_397_5880_3528/master/5880.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33bf6a12390115482bda7f09b3d4c4f 11500w","title":"the gold coast sun drenched sin city that wants to shine","story":"Famed for parties, brawls and bikini-clad meter maids, Australia’s Vegas is more dynamic than its mythology suggests Pristine beaches stretching for 70km, enviable weather, world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, and enough big city infrastructure to keep punters interested – Australia’s Gold Coast is a pleasure centre. But for many it has a pervasive dark side: a city once branded as a sunny place for shady people.One of Australia’s most revered writers once told me he comes here to have his breakdowns. On a visit in 1997, Prince Charles was reported to have said its gaudy skyscrapers contributed to the “uglification” of one of the world’s top holiday spots. In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf.Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its capital cities (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way.Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness.Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth.The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid?Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started.The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation.All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so.The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past.Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic.The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or ACDC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis. Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.They may have visited in a pack of mates at the annual Schoolies festival – a Spring Break equivalent that erupted in the 1970s and still attracts tens of thousands of school leavers. Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”.It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole.The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged.In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate.The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since.This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards.Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The BBC appoints a prominent radical leftist, a lifelong Bennite, the chairman of the publisher of a prominent leftwing publication no less, as its flagship political presenter and interviewer. This person has made speeches in homage of Karl Marx calling for the establishment of full-blooded socialism in Britain, including a massive increase in public ownership, hiking taxes on the rich to fund a huge public investment programme, and reversing anti-union laws. They appear on our “impartial” Auntie Beeb wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of a hardline leftist thinktank. Their BBC editor is a former Labour staffer who moves to become Jeremy Corbyn’s communications chief. They use their Twitter feed – where they have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to a platform handed to them by the BBC – to promote radical leftist causes.This would never happen. It is unthinkable, in fact. If the BBC establishment somehow entered this parallel universe, the British press would be on the brink of insurrection. And yet, the strange case of Andrew Neil, the ultra-Thatcherite former Sunday Times editor who is the BBC’s flagship political presenter, is an instructive example about how our media works.Neil is a formidable political interviewer in many ways: forensic, unrelenting, quick-witted, sardonic. But consider the background of this former Conservative party researcher. When Jeremy Corbyn had the audacity to meet with leftwing Jewish group Jewdas, Neil smeared them as “nutters” last year, he made a speech denouncing antisemitism on the left. To be clear, leftwing antisemitism exists and must be vanquished. But Neil has no moral authority on this issue. As editor of the Sunday Times in 1992, he hired Britain’s foremost Holocaust denier, Nazi apologist David Irving, to work on the Goebbels diaries. To hire a sympathiser of Hitler and denier of the worst atrocity in history to do respectable work for a national newspaper – to offer a reputational lifeline to a man who should have been treated as a pariah – was a disgrace for which he has never apologised. As the Wiener Library, the oldest institution devoted to the study of the Holocaust, said at the time: “David Irving denies the gas chambers. Anyone who deals with him is tainted with that.”Not long after becoming a high-profile BBC presenter, Neil made a speech in homage to rightwing radical Friedrich Hayek, in which he called for a “radical programme to liberalise the British economy a radical reduction in tax and public spending as a share of the economy” as well as a flat tax “and the injection of choice and competition into the public sector on a scale not yet contemplated”. During last year’s general election, he presented the Daily Politics wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of the hardcore neoliberal Adam Smith Institute. His editor was Robbie Gibb, a former adviser to Michael Portillo – another longstanding colleague of Neil on This Week. Last year Gibb became Theresa May’s head of communications.Neil’s Twitter account – which has hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to his BBC gig – is routinely used to promote rightwing causes. He uses this platform to denounce the scientific consensus on climate change, reviling what he calls “the climate mafia” and claiming that deviation from the consensus meant “the witch-finders want to burn you”. It is not the first time he has deviated from scientific consensus. When he was Sunday Times editor, his newspaper ran a series of articles arguing that HIV did not cause Aids. It was a theme picked up by the Spectator 15 years later. Let’s be clear: this contemptible myth risked people’s lives. His Twitter feed, too, reveals a relentless sympathy for Brexit and denunciation of its critics. A valid political perspective, but not coming from the BBC’s main politics presenter on the biggest issue facing Britain. Again unsurprising, given that he once called “for a reorientation of British foreign policy away from Europe towards Asia and Latin America”and “unilateral free trade, regardless of the policy in Brussels”.His firebrand rightwing politics aside, Neil skins politicians alive across the political spectrum, comes the inevitable retort. There is no question that Neil is exceptionally bright and well-read with an acute eye for detail: it is a grave error to turn up unprepared with him in the chair, as I discovered in one of my earliest TV appearances. And yes, he did recently take down a Tory minister for the absurd smears against Corbyn over a crank ex-Czechoslovak spy: that he was applauded for doing his job here shows how low the left’s expectations are. But as a general rule, while Neil will fillet politicians on both left and right on the basis of competence, he reserves his ideological assaults on the left, ridiculing Corbyn over Russia – which one would expect on US TV networks, where impartiality rules do not apply.Last month, when Green MP Caroline Lucas tabled an Urgent Question on bullying and harassment in Parliament, Neil excoriated her for not talking about rape in Telford instead. When Lucas responded that the Telford case was “absolutely appalling” and that she backed an urgent public inquiry into the matter, but that didn’t mean MPs shouldn’t get their own House in order, Neil denounced her for making a comparison between “what some middle class women had suffered” and the Telford scandal – one he alone had made. The consequence was an online pile-on. Imagine if a prominent leftwing BBC journalist existed and launched such a baseless out-of-nowhere attack on a rightwing politician?Why does this all matter? Critiquing any prominent journalist normally results in a defensive backlash: it is regarded as the ultimate sin within media ranks. But the issue here is about a system. The media are one of the most essential pillars of any democracy, and must be critiqued as such. The usual BBC defence is that the corporation is attacked from both sides, and therefore must be neutral. This is a logical fallacy. For one, it does not take into account which side is more assertive or dominant. Our press overwhelmingly supports the Tories and is intolerant of even mild deviations from rightwing orthodoxy. The BBC itself is dominated by social and economic liberalism, which is why it provokes ire from left and right: but that isn’t neutrality, either. Its daily news priorities are set and framed by the front pages of Conservative-supporting newspapers.Neil himself would be the most intimidating and effective rightwing polemicist in Britain if he was freed from the BBC. But the fact that somebody as stridently leftwing as he is rightwing would never be appointed to such a position is indicative of how our media operate. Many on the left fear that any critique of Auntie will play into the hands of a right wing that would privatise and gut the BBC if it could. This deference means that BBC political output remains framed by rightwing assumptions. The Media Reform Coalition has suggested a series of proposals, such as freeing the BBC from all government interference and a BBC board elected by licence-payers and BBC staff. At the very least, as the case of Neil underlines, the left – which, after all, represents millions of Britons – must stop accepting its continued media marginalisation as just one of those things. It isn’t – and it must change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d0ea3a0b7a20b869d91fb83b873017eaad5cba/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7639d90fb877be68137638c417b5c93e 1720w","title":"homes jobs future global capitalism mainstream political parties","story":"It’s just like old times. Donald Trump has picked\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfight with China over trade and he is at odds with Russia over Syria. Relations between Beijing and Moscow are getting closer as the former communist superpowers confront the old American enemy. A regional conflict in the Middle East is a means by which the United States and Russia can engage without actually coming to blows – until now at least. Welcome to the new\u0026nbspcold war.\u0026nbspThe clock has been turned back to the days\u0026nbspbefore the Berlin Wall came down.History tells us that the first cold war lasted from 1945 until 1990, and was won by the west. Capitalism triumphed over communism, freedom over tyranny. The early 1990s witnessed a victory roll for markets: economic shock treatment was administered to the former Soviet Union and its satellites a global free trade\u0026nbspdeal was wrapped up and parties of the left got with the programme. They stopped talking about socialism and embraced the need for greater competition, efficiency and labour market flexibility.The centre of gravity of politics shifted. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the middle ground in the\u0026nbspwest was halfway\u0026nbspbetween full-blown communism at one extreme\u0026nbspand full-blown capitalism at the other. From the late 19th century onwards, the fear that the working\u0026nbspclasses would be seduced by Marxism prompted parties of both left and right to introduce reforms intended to knock some of the rough edges off capitalism. Bismarck was won over to the idea of old age pensions the welfare state in Britain was started by the Liberal government of 1906 Roosevelt came down hard on Wall Street during the Great Depression.There were plenty more concessions after the second world war. With the Red Army occupying eastern Europe and strong communist parties in France and Italy, the generosity of America’s Marshall plan was not just philanthropy. It was also the result of fear of communism and a feeling that if capitalism couldn’t deliver for ordinary people, they had somewhere else to go.This anxiety dwindled over the decades as it became\u0026nbspclear that the Soviet Union’s economy worked a lot better when the need was to provide tanks and aircraft for total war than it did to produce consumer goods in peacetime. The end of the cold war removed the threat of an alternative ideology altogether. So the new middle ground – the third way – moved closer to an\u0026nbspundiluted form of capitalism.To take just one obvious example, the economic strategy being proposed at present by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor – higher personal and corporate\u0026nbsptaxes, state ownership of the public utilities and the railways, a national investment bank – would have been firmly in the social democratic mainstream when the cold war was at its height. Now it is seen as so extreme that Labour dissidents are – in another echo of the past – toying with the idea of forming a new centrist party.In the new post-cold war politics, parties that once believed their job was to make capitalism work for voters now believed their task was to make voters fit for\u0026nbspcapitalism. State intervention did not cease, it merely took a different form. Governments might have\u0026nbspbelieved they could do nothing to prevent communities wiped out by deindustrialisation and were no longer to guarantee full employment as they once had, so instead they used welfare reform to get the unemployed to take low-paid jobs and tell the poor that they needed to smoke less, drink less and eat more healthily. State control over the people replaced state control over the economy as the focus of policy, and it didn’t really matter whether the voters liked the tough love or not, because there was nowhere else to go.It is now almost three decades since the cold war ended, and few hanker for a return to the days when the iron curtain ided Europe. Yet the promises made in the early 1990s have not been fulfilled. Liberalising markets did not lead to economic nirvana instead the orgy of speculation unleashed led to the financial crisis of 2008. Living standards have continued to rise in the west, but more slowly than they once did. Productivity growth has stalled. In the UK, personal debt levels are not much lower than they were before the crash.The country that has done best in the post-cold war era – China – has done so with a version of the old middle way. Strong growth has meant a stupendous fall in poverty rates over the past four decades but movements of capital have been carefully regulated, trade barriers have remained higher than in the US or Europe and the state has maintained ownership of large\u0026nbspchunks of industry. China has become more market friendly but only up to a point.The decision to embrace the discipline of the global\u0026nbspmarketplace has proved disastrous for parties of\u0026nbspthe centre left. They did well enough during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when cheap imported goods flooded in from China, but were bereft of ideas when the\u0026nbspglobal economy hit the wall in 2008. Where there would once have been a plan to re-regulate capitalism\u0026nbspthere was instead an intellectual vacuum.There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from this. The first is that the mainstream parties need to come up with policies that do things for people rather than do things to people. The record shows that the managed capitalism of the cold war delivered better results than the unmanaged capitalism since.The second lesson is that voters don’t buy the idea that global capitalism is a force of nature – the economic\u0026nbspequivalent of the “beast from the east” – that cannot be tamed. That’s why Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports and McDonnell’s plan to nationalise the utility companies are proving popular. People want now what they have always wanted: a job, decent pay, a pension, a roof over their heads and a sense that their children will be better off than they are. They can’t understand why the global economy can’t deliver today what nation states could deliver half a century ago.There is one final lesson. If mainstream parties don’t come up with the answers, the evidence is that voters will look elsewhere for solutions. The rise of populism explodes the myth that they have nowhere else to go.• Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282662c08af2c852e4ab5ea7bf417577bdeea357/50_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e21ea6e776cce9d54b4bfab8b17e40f5 1240w","title":"critical gulf stream current weakest for 1600 years research finds","story":"Warm current that has historically caused dramatic changes in climate is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown and may be less stable than thought - with potentially severe consequencesThe warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past is now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years, new research shows. The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur.The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current.Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches.“Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought.The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa.They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so.The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.”A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aa9c23a5fa78ab23d61a01fbecbe845e4d95c42/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d1de1e03c88f0bc8aaf0e5e8e90e9d00 1240w","title":"horror quiet place get out hollywood","story":"While the industry hedges its bets on reboots and expanded universes, subversive scare flicks such as A Quiet Place and Get Out are making low-budget risk-taking payHorror, it seems, will never die. The undermining of traditional releasing strategies by Netflix premieres and simultaneous releases of movies in cinemas and on demand has led to Hollywood anxiously doubling down on safe sequels, reboots and expanded universes. Yet a legion of smart, subversive and downright scary horror movies has been packing them in.Look at the barnstorming success of A Quiet Place, the pin-drop survival thriller where John Krasinski and his Little House on the Prairie clan live in tiptoeing fear of hunter-killer beasties who are hypersensitive to sound. It’s a supremely crafted, allegorically rich nerve-jangler that forces audiences to shut the hell up or be complicit in the razor-clawed slaughter. From a $17m (£12m) budget, A Quiet Place brought in a boisterous $50m in its first weekend, making it Paramount’s biggest opening since Star Trek Beyond, an expensive blockbuster sequel that cost $175m.This is not some quick-and-dirty exploitation movie: A Quiet Place has been almost universally praised by critics, to the extent that blockbuster overlord Michael Bay, who shepherded the project through his Platinum Dunes production arm, took to Instagram to drily note that the movie’s sky-high Rotten Tomatoes score was “a first for my company”. Even after horror’s banner year in 2017 – with hot-button word-of-mouth Oscar-winner Get Out, M Night Shyamalan’s unexpectedly career-reviving Split and the $700m global success of It’s killer clown showreel – this feels like an intriguing new benchmark.Like comedies, horror movies have always been enriched by being a communal experience where you can hear other patrons gasp or nervously giggle in the dark, which may help explain their multiplex resilience in the on-demand home entertainment era. It has been more than two decades since Scream built a quadrilogy around the idea that everyone had long absorbed the rules of slasher films. So for writers and directors, the challenge is to come up with something that horror fans – loyal but often seemingly insatiable – have not seen or experienced before. At its best, the genre is in a constant state of reinvention, helped by the fact that low-production budgets can be fertile ground for high-risk storytelling.While the creative talent may be attracted by opportunities to try something new, horror’s continuing appeal to producers and studios is baser: audiences have always been more jazzed by creepy concepts or masked monsters than recognisable (and costly) stars. The genre also has a fine tradition of performing uncanny box office jujitsu, transforming bargain-basement shockers into hits with enviable profit multipliers.The most impressive 21st-century case study is still 2007’s Paranormal Activity, the security-cam poltergeist chiller that spun an $11,000 budget into a $200m phenomenon, giving birth to a franchise in the process. That low-budget titan was a defining hit for Jason Blum and Blumhouse Productions, horror specialists with a knack for steering movies with slim budgets into profitable successes by nurturing talent and canny marketing. The Blumhouse catalogue includes Get Out, Split, Happy Death Day and the Insidious, Sinister and Purge franchises: conspicuously well-made movies that often splice social commentary into their scares.A Quiet Place feels like a conscious attempt by Paramount to ape the Blumhouse blueprint, much like A24, another fleet and industrious production company, which has achieved critical inroads with idiosyncratic horror-adjacent movies such as The Witch, A Ghost Story and It Comes at Night. (They’re also distributing Toni Colette-starring shocker Hereditary, which is already being talked up as one of the year’s scariest horror films). Should Blumhouse be worried that it is being stalked? The company seems focused on its own typically busy production and release slate for 2018. As well as a handshake deal with Oscar-nominated Dee Rees to make a lesbian horror movie, other irons in the fire include urban vampire tale Family Blood, a new project from Saw and Insidious writer Leigh Whannell, and a sequel to Halloween.Reactivating John Carpenter’s classic slasher franchise feels like a way to align Blumhouse with horror’s blue-chip-properties past but it has just as much confidence in its self-generated material. The First Purge, a prequel to the lawlessness franchise that echoes and intensifies America’s national conversation about violence and gun control, has cheerfully squatted on the 4 July release date that was traditionally home to Will Smith blockbusters. The Purge gimmick is that, for one evening, its characters can do whatever they like. The best current horror film-makers seem to have taken the ‘anything goes’ ethos to heart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d1253ec4497952e308c54f53ca004c0f3c7c56/251_218_3689_2214/master/3689.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fb6e1760dd2f46730bddd6826d5186f2 1240w","title":"real madrid juventus champions league quarter final second leg match report","story":"Real Madrid are in the Champions League semi-finals for the eighth year in a row. That is no surprise but what is a surprise is that for so much of a dramatic, nervous night at the Bernabéu it looked like they might not be.A round of shocks almost had the biggest of them all, a miracle mighty close, the champions following Barcelona in being knocked out by Italian opposition. In Turin they had been applauded, Cristiano Ronaldo holding his heart in gratitude after his superb goal was handed an ovation at the Bernabéu there were hands on hearts too, in agony, right to the end. And then Ronaldo appeared once more.Juventus took Madrid to the cliff edge with a 3-0 lead with two from Mario Mandzukic and one from Blaise Matuidi. Until, into the third minute of added time, Lucas Vázquez went down under a challenge from Medhi Benatia. The referee, Michael Oliver, pointed to the spot. As Juventus’s players surrounded him, seeing hope slip away, screaming injustice, Gigi Buffon was sent off, his last European game ending with him walking from the field, angry and unmoved by the ovation.And so a place in the semi-finals came down a penalty: the world watching, Ronaldo waiting, the substitute goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny eventually standing before him. One shot. It flew high into the net, Ronaldo raced to the corner flag, throwing his shirt in the air, the stadium erupting, barely able to believe it. Juventus couldn’t, either. The roar was delight and relief.Fear had visited Madrid fans early, a realisation there was a game on, one they had never anticipated, despite the warnings. It never really let go. Douglas Costa played in Sami Khedira, running in on the right, and he clipped the cross to the far post where Mandzukic arrived and headed in the opener. The clock said 1:16: it was the quickest goal Madrid had conceded in this competition and it was just the start. An hour and a half later, this had still not been resolved: a tie that had appeared over a week ago was not yet done.Less than 30 seconds after the goal, Juventus were back: the celebration high in the north end had barely subsided and the rallying call from the rest of the ground had hardly been raised when Gonzalo Higuaín was there, deep inside the area. He was slow, the shot scuffed and the chance wasted, but the storm had not passed. Mattia De Sciglio delivered two crosses in a minute and then Costa, who tore into them throughout, raced into the area, forcing Keylor Navas to e at the feet of Higuaín.All this had happened inside seven minutes and although Gareth Bale forced a save from Buffon two minutes later, Dani Carvajal then bursting through and Isco having one ruled out for offside, the ordeal continued. Carvajal had to clear Mandzukic’s delivery and the resulting corner went through to the Croat, bouncing off his shins and into Navas’s hands from five yards. This was relentless it was also only 15 minutes in and yet there could have been three or four already.Still the chances came at both ends. Higuaín shot over, Toni Kroos was blocked and Isco curled wide. Madrid had wrested some control, a little breathing room. Or so it seemed. A minute after Buffon was out to save from Isco, Juventus got the second. De Sciglio had been forced off but the supply from the right was not cut. Stephan Lichtsteiner this time curled to Mandzukic to head home. At the other end, Raphaël Varane’s header thumped back off the bar on the stroke of half‑time.As the players departed, so Vázquez and Asensio came out to warm up. “I had to change something,” Zinedine Zidane, the Madrid manager, said. But Juventus continued on the front foot, led by Costa, immediately curling over.Juventus were one goal from extra time and on the hour they got it, when Navas dropped a long, deep and largely inoffensive cross at the feet of Blaise Matuidi, who scrambled it over the line.Level on aggregate and away goals too, the psychological and tactical advantage was Juve’s. That situation also created doubts, though: they had something to lose now and a decision to make: look for the goal now or later? Madrid, in part, shared that: 20 minutes now, or 30 minutes later? With each passing minute, that question became more pertinent, the balance tilting towards extra time, the margins finer, the tension and the risks greater. If, that is, they could even choose. Max Allegri, Juve’s manager, later implied he preferred the security of 30, but in the end he never got it.Ronaldo’s deflected shot squeezed wide, Jesús Vallejo blocked Khedira, Buffon scrambled to save from Isco and Ronaldo shot just wide, then headed over with five minutes left. This was not over yet but there would be less time left than anyone thought. When Vázquez went over in the last minute, the whole match, 180 extraordinary minutes, was reduced to one moment.Time passed, tension grew, a simple end for a chaotic occasion. “My heart rate went up but I calmed myself because I knew it would be decisive,” Ronaldo said. On a night of nerves, he showed none."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d95c5595156d462e812d4969f0ca036eeeec31d/133_106_2245_1347/master/2245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bc1d63eb6d9d8c4862c6a04ae8262f5a 1240w","title":"sunderland newcastle fans celebrate relegation stadium of light","story":"• Supporters seek to gloat over rivals’ plight at Stadium of Light• Sunderland to have no cash turnstiles for final gamesSunderland have taken discreet steps to prevent gleeful Newcastle fans from turning up at the Stadium of Light and mocking Chris Coleman’s struggling side during their final two home games of the season.With Sunderland looking certain to drop into League One, chatter on social media and fans forums suggested Newcastle fans had planned to attend the home matches against Burton and Wolves in order to gloat.Aware of this Sunderland – seemingly bound for a second successive relegation – had no cash turnstiles open for Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Norwich and are expected to do likewise for their next two home fixtures.In 1987, when the Wearsiders were demoted to the third tier for the first time in their history, more than 1,000 Newcastle fans appeared at Roker Park to cheer on Gillingham during the play-off second leg which they won on away goals, consigning Sunderland to the old Third Division.In order to prevent a repeat, tickets for the Burton and Wolves games will have to be bought through the ticket office where staff are likely to insist on evidence of a history of attending games at the Stadium of Light. This policy should screen out mischief-making Newcastle supporters.With Sunderland’s crowds having dropped sharply – (a crowd of only 24,894 attended the Norwich game at a ground which averaged well over 40,000 a match during its decade in the Premier League) – it represents a fairly drastic measure. Yet although relations between fans of the rival north-east clubs have improved significantly in recent years, seats were smashed during a Tyne-Wear altercation at an under-23 game at Sunderland last month.Six points adrift of fourth-bottom Bolton, Coleman’s team are second bottom of the Championship and have only four matches in which to save themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92c2040450e90595d4ebff44350fff3fe356a5d4/298_118_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=df3a533c236e932a552f33f6ded07eb6 1240w","title":"pep guardiola manchester city three straight defeats champions league exit","story":"After three straight defeats, City’s manager is not ‘a fraud’ and neither has he been ‘found out’ – rather rivals have realised how to exploit his side’s weak spotsIs Pep Guardiola a bald fraud? Before Manchester City’s three consecutive defeats in the last eight days, this seemed to be one of the more urgent questions of the modern sporting age.It looked a simple enough dichotomy. Is the man who gave us the most compelling elite club team and the finished‑article Lionel Messi, a high‑class manager whose teams retain a skein of brittleness against the best opponents? Or is he, in fact, a fraud. And not just a fraud but a bald fraud. A bald foreign fraud, the worst kind of fraud there is.Things have moved on in the past few days, glossed by the elimination from the Champions League on Tuesday at the hands of a fine, compact, ice‑cold Liverpool team. The public appear to have spoken. An internet search for the phrases “bald fraud” and “Pep Guardiola” over the past seven days produces a decisive, clinching 4,700 matches, even if many of those relate to an article by the otherwise excellent journalist Ken Early openly denying – imagine! – that Guardiola is a bald fraud.Before the first-leg defeat by Liverpool, these same search numbers were down in the one‑thousands. And frankly the data doesn’t lie. The question is no longer, whether Guardiola is a bald fraud. It is instead: how long has he been a bald fraud? And how was European football, with all its misleading facts and data and elements of obvious beauty so easily tricked out of its jewels, its virtue and its timeshare in Alicante by this handsome egg-headed swindler?There is of course another point of view. Stepping away from the tribal blurts of received footballing opinion, it is possible the bald fraud narrative is an oversimplification. Football has always loved its pig‑headed certainties, its binary shades, although it is a relatively new idea that successful, confident, (foreign) people are no longer allowed just to lose but must instead be “found out”, exposed, stripped bare of their fanciness.The main point here is that sticking to this narrative also misses the best bits of City’s recent struggles. Not to mention the deeper fascination of how Guardiola, who is actually pretty good at coaching football teams, might adapt to an effective, considered response to his team’s frictionless domination of the first three-quarters of the season.The first point is obvious enough. Other football managers are also allowed to be clever, adaptive, resourceful people at the top of their profession. If Jürgen Klopp and José Mourinho have found a way to interfere with the fine‑point machinery of Guardiola’s team, this does not naturally mean his life’s work is meaningless, his trophies the tarnished baubles of a cosseted princeling.City fans have already been quick to point to bad luck (Leroy Sané’s disallowed goal at the Etihad Stadium) and to the fact anyone can lose in knockout football as evidence that nothing has really changed. The truth, as ever, is somewhere in between. Something different has clearly been happening in the past three games and in the last 10, five of which have been lost.The basic statistics from those three defeats make for interesting reading. City dominated every metric, as is so often the case. In defeat to Liverpool (twice) and Manchester United they had more corners (23 to six combined) more shots (51 to 19) and – of course – more possession of the ball. Across those 270 losing minutes City made a staggering 1,778 accurate passes to their opponents’ 799, an average of three and a half more accurate passes every minute of every game.This was not all cold possession or meaningless sideways passing. City were still pressing forward and making chances. And yet on the one metric that matters they lost by a combined score of 8-3, to opponents who for long periods appeared comfortable sitting out that familiar sky blue weather front.So what has changed? There are two obvious answers. The balance of play was exactly the same as in two big games City won earlier in the season against Manchester United and Arsenal – but with one exception. City also dominated the dribbling numbers in those previous games, whereas in their last three games they were out-dribbled every time, with City players dribbled past four or five more times on each occasion.This is not a random stat. It chimes with the wider sense of a shift of attitude, a change in the way City’s opponents have been prepared to play without the ball, knowing they also have a way to attack. For most of what was in the end a comfortable two‑leg victory Liverpool sat and waited without seeming rushed or panicked, a team prepared to see not having the ball as an opportunity, a chance to strike from deep at what can be a fragile defence.Again this is not a magic bullet. City have not been “exposed”. But all managers study their opponents for weaknesses and while Nicolás Otamendi, in particular, has improved under Guardiola he was also reduced to a cartwheeling funk every time Mohamed Salah ran in his direction.Hence those dribble stats. Hence Manchester United’s controlled, driving aggression in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. Perhaps there was a clue in Crystal Palace’s performance at Selhurst Park on New Year’s Eve, when Roy Hodgson sent his team out to press aggressively and isolate Wilfried Zaha against City’s defenders, producing their biggest test to date.Again there is nothing in this that requires anyone to be shamed or retrospectively stripped of their achievements. Guardiola’s excellence brought some studied excellence in response from Hodgson – and now from Klopp and Mourinho. The league is improved by this process, our entertainment improved and given shape.The most interesting question now is how Guardiola will respond. Elements of English football have been desperate for him to fail and to fail in exactly this way to be exposed as lazy and vain, an Improper Football Man, all foreign-accented short cuts and dossier-fondling privilege.Let’s face it, he ticks some pretty hot boxes, from the basic offence of being both foreign, successful and arrogant, to deeper issues of method and attitude, of a notably academic, theorising approach.The easy response would be to go out and buy players good enough to implement those ball-playing tactics without weaknesses, players so good the system will always work. It will be fascinating to see how he plays it, whether he tinkers with his own setup or looks to surprise his opponents in turn, as he did in varying methods at Bayern Munich, or simply coaching what he has to more and better of the same.Defeat will always leave Guardiola open to the taunts of the bald-fraud squad. In reality, to lose this way, still hammering at the same door, lost in his own methods, is simply a part of his appeal, those draining, quixotic defeats another layer to the pleasure his teams can bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e4245e683c703eb722af6978719efdb671cdf/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d6db19fddb35dd028bc204a07afcc5f 2600w","title":"ultra processed truth 10 bestselling foods cherry bakewell fray bentos pies","story":"From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands? Nutritionists assess them – and just what they might mean for our healthAs the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today.We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go.Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although inidually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term.The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says.A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”.His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.”We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating?Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment.Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process.Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.”Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.”A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick.Young’s said it would not be able to comment.There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.”Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other.Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment.“As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing.The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.”A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.”There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil.McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says.A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.”Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott.Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins.Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate).“There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.”Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.”Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate. It also has emulsifiers and flavourings – as well as cheap palm oil – that you wouldn’t have in the kitchen cupboard. These are engineered to give the right silky mouthfeel for a chocolate bar.Cadbury did not respond to requests for comment.“In this environment, it’s really not surprising that we’ve ended up in the situation where half of our calories are coming from ultra-processed foods,” Scott says. Like other food campaigners, she wants TV advertising bans before 9pm and a clampdown on promotions – and some way of making healthy food as cheap as the factory-made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75f1c934bfec790405664616d6b3a8882439849/546_292_6662_3998/master/6662.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b2b724b8cb9537117a073f9e6459fcc8 1240w","title":"new safeguards for british holidaymakers who book online","story":"EU travel rules will give internet deals the same levels of financial cover as traditional packagesBritish holidaymakers will benefit from greater protection when booking online under new EU rules that come into force this summer. Updated UK package travel regulations, part of an EU directive due to take effect for holidays booked from 1 July, aim to create a level playing field by making online retailers as responsible for consumer protection as traditional travel agents.An estimated 45m overseas holidays are taken each year by Britons, of which 20m are conventional package holidays with flights, coach or rail travel which are primarily protected by Abta. But 3m so-called “flight-plus” arrangements which have until now had lesser protection will be brought into the safety net. Flight-plus is a holiday booking where a flight departing the UK and accommodation andor car hire are booked at the same time or within a day, but where the way in which it is sold means it is not a package holiday. These will no longer exist under the package travel regulations and instead could form part of a package or a linked travel arrangement.“When we book a package holiday we expect it all to go according to plan, but if a company goes bust it can ruin more than just the holiday, leaving people out of pocket or even stranded,” said the consumer minister, Andrew Griffiths. “These new rules mean that internet explorers can book their holidays online, secure in the knowledge they will be compensated in the same way as someone who booked their holidays through a travel agent if something does go wrong.”Mark Tanzer, the chief executive of Abta, said: “More holiday travel arrangements will be classified as packages, meaning greater protection for these types of holiday. “Package holidays offer the best form of protection not only are you entitled to a refund or to be brought home should your travel company go out of business, but you also benefit from additional legal protection – for example, the right to a refund if bad weather means your holiday can’t be provided.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23b33e0c1d46b82eb2bba02406f570bf6230b6fd/0_149_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6d8d2cc5557d5b6b709a9aa7454e3df4 2600w","title":"bernie sanders jeremy corbyn labour for the many","story":"A visit to one of the US socialist’s rallies inspired former Labour strategist Steve Howell. In an exclusive extract from his new book, he writes about the power of storytelling and the eureka moment behind the party’s 2017 campaign sloganAs Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to be Labour leader for the first time in 2015, something unprecedented was happening in the US: a democratic socialist was emerging as a serious contender for the presidency. Never in US political history had someone labelling themselves with the “S” word been more than a fringe candidate.Hillary Clinton had name recognition, huge resources, and the backing of the entire Democrat establishment. However, she had alienated many grassroots Democrat supporters with her backing for regime-change wars and trade deals that had decimated entire industries and destroyed thousands of jobs.Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, had voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and was challenging her with a campaign platform that – like Corbyn’s – zeroed-in on growing wealth inequality. Sanders reiterated that core message in rally after rally through the summer and autumn of 2015. And it soon became clear he was striking a chord with voters.By 2016 I wanted to see what it was like to #FeelTheBern. And I was not disappointed. The rally I attended – on 4 June, on the concourse of the Los Angeles Coliseum – was slickly organised. Staff and volunteers managed security as more than 13,000 people queued patiently to pass through the barriers. There were three hours of music and speeches by Hollywood A-listers – among them Rosario Dawson, Shailene Woodley, Max Carver and, my own favourite, 90-year-old Dick Van Dyke “giving a young politician a hand-up” by leading a “we love you, Bernie” sing-along. By the time Sanders made his entrance, the event was all over Twitter and the anticipation was huge. Flanked by his wife, Jane, and his children and grandchildren, he spoke from a lectern decorated with a US flag and the campaign’s “a future to believe in” strapline, and stuck to a text that embodied the arguments he had been repeating at every single rally for months. There was no message-creep and no need for him to shout – every word would be of broadcast quality for mainstream media and live streaming online.Afterwards I was not alone among Corbyn’s supporters in reflecting on what Labour could learn from the Sanders campaign. Not only was there considerable common ground on policy, they were both “anti-establishment” politicians who had the authenticity and credibility, on the one hand, to counter the rightwing populism of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and, on the other, to inspire and mobilise young people on a scale not seen for a generation.However, importing ideas from another country, even one with a nominally common language, is a hazardous business. Some ideas do not travel well. Sometimes good ideas are dismissed because of where they have come from.When Bill Clinton emerged to win the 1992 presidential election, the Labour modernisers fell in love with American politics. They saw Clinton’s “new” Democrats, with their focus on appealing to middle-class aspiration, as the model for New Labour. The one thing they expressly did not acquire from Clinton was his liking for campaign rallies. Bill is a charming and engaging orator who loves a big crowd, but New Labour had a strong aversion to political rallies, dismissing them as preaching to the converted. Which is all very well if the media is on your side, but for politicians challenging the status quo, every opportunity to speak to large numbers of people directly is like gold dust.Sanders had made a virtue of necessity in building his campaign around big rallies that were welcoming to people new to politics. Looking back on it afterwards, he wrote: “A rally of thousands of people standing together … is something unforgettable and extraordinarily powerful. It is not something that a television ad can accomplish.”The rallies were a generator that powered all the other elements, creating virtuous circles of highly charged activity. Videos would be shared far and wide on social media. New volunteers signed up at rallies would be trained to go out canvassing. Contact details collected would be used to disseminate campaign materials and raise money online.Mass fundraising from small donors was one of the stand-out features of the Sanders campaign. At the outset, he had decided that “you cannot take on the establishment if you take their money.” Sanders was also adept at using social media, despite personally being a novice.But he was not dismissive of conventional methods. He had used paid-for radio, television and print advertising in numerous previous election campaigns and believed it still played an important role. In his bid for the presidency, as his support grew, he was able to compete with Clinton on paid advertising. By the end, the Sanders campaign had spent more than $100m on media buying. What distinguished his use of a conventional medium, however, was the way his ads – in both their imagery and words – were mainly about people and their stories. While the Clinton campaign was running traditional candidate messages, focusing on her political record, the Sanders ads were – as marketing agency executives put it – “tapping into what people are feeling” and offering “a deeper sense of idealism”.At Westminster, as the end of March 2017 approached, the inspiring Sanders rally I had gone to felt very distant. The local elections were looming. Campaign materials had to be produced within a matter of days, and our plans to get a policy bandwagon rolling had been delayed by the horrific Westminster Bridge attack. In the discussions with Southside, Labour’s head office near Victoria, during that period, there was much rolling of eyes when I offered some thoughts on how we should campaign in the local elections. I had half-expected my references to the Sanders campaign to be dismissed, and they were (“he lost,” I was told), but I had not bargained for the amusement use of the phrase “narrative arcs” would cause.Storytelling has been used in marketing communications for years, simply because it is how most of us talk to each other most of the time – we tell people about things that have happened to us or others and then we might discuss what we feel or think about them. Conversation is mainly storytelling. And so is the best political communication, which is why some of the Sanders videos were so effective, and why the leader of the opposition’s office – known by the acronym Loto – had already accepted a kind offer from the film director Ken Loach to use his skills.But this goes wider than how you produce a video. The whole campaign needed to tell the same story – an overarching narrative that voiced people’s fears, frustrations and hopes, and described a road to a better future. In a dishonest way, the big personalities of neo-liberalism, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, were ahead of the curve on this. Their narrative triumphed for a generation because they convinced enough people that public spending and trade unions were to blame for the economic woes that hit capitalism in the 1970s, and that the private sector, set free to operate in de-regulated global markets, would create wealth and affluence.But, if I was ever frustrated by some of those early discussions, one thing that would always lift my spirits was the irrepressible activity of what were known in Loto as “Jeremy’s outriders”. There were dozens of them on Twitter and Facebook who, day in and day out, were pumping out great material exposing the Tories and putting across many of our arguments. I include in this organised groups such as JeremyCorbyn4PM and Momentum, but mostly they were people acting on their own initiative out of sheer personal commitment. When the election was called a month or so later, they would play a crucial role. The Tories had nothing like it. Since the election, they had produced a “digital toolkit”, but Peter Stefanovic – a lawyer who had given up his day job to spend a year campaigning, and one of the outriders I had most contact with – thought it lacked a crucial ingredient: “The difference is that we believe passionately in what we’re doing, in the manifesto, in the principles behind it and how it’s going to change the country. You can’t manufacture that belief.”Stefanovic is a natural communicator with a knack for finding the right words to make a point or, dare I say it, tell a story. If this was easy, more people would be good at it. But language is a complicated thing. And the Sanders campaign was not so helpful in this respect. Some of their terms could be imported – a “rigged” system was one we used – but George Bernard Shaw was right when he said the US and Britain are two countries disunited by a common language. Corbyn could not say he would “stand up for Main Street against Wall Street” and “fight for the shrinking middle class” without confusing everyone.Among British political terms, I felt the phrase “left behind” presented some problems. In a note to Seumas Milne, the director of strategy and communications, before I started as his deputy in the leader’s office, I said I thought it was isive. Ukip and far-right newspapers such as the Daily Express were using “left behind” to pit predominantly white working-class communities against a so-called liberal metropolitan elite. In using “left behind” we were actually reinforcing the false idea that the only people left behind are in Brexit-leaning areas where traditional industries have been decimated. Who is most “left behind”: a young person in Islwyn who can’t get a job, or a young person in Islington who can’t afford the rent on a bedsitter, never mind buy their own home? Globalisation destroys jobs in some parts of the country and inflates house prices in others. “Left behind” pits its victims against each other. Which, of course, is why Farage and co use it.Milne and I were agreed on this, and he had already started discussing these narrative issues with two consultants, Marc Lopatin and Jem Bendell. In a blog a few months earlier, they had argued that Theresa May had “put her tanks on Labour’s lawn” by kicking off her premiership with “a spot of cross-dressing” in her pitch to ordinary working-class families. To respond, Labour needed to create a “permission space” with voters who weren’t listening to us because the Tories had been successful in blaming us for the deficit. Arguing that tactics and language had to be “fit for purpose,” they had said: “And that purpose is securing votes. So, while Corbyn’s ultimate vision involves stirring a lost spirit of solidarity and community, Labour must embrace voters as they find them and design conversations accordingly. Because the prize is bigger than reconnecting with former Labour heartlands. When Mrs May references working-class families as ‘just getting by,’ she also knows that millions of families higher up the income ladder identify themselves in the very same terms.“So, when Labour speaks, it needs to explain how government has been failing families across the board and how this can be fixed ... If Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership can lift its gaze beyond the food bank, the government will have a fight on its hands.”I did not see austerity as only being about food banks – or its other extreme manifestations, such as homelessness – but was that the impression we were giving?Jon Trickett, meanwhile, had prepared a paper for the Loto strategy group that overlapped with these discussions. Trickett is one of Corbyn’s closest allies and brings to the table not only the insights of an MP from a northern seat – Hemsworth in West Yorkshire – but also a searching political mind that looks beyond what’s going on in the trenches. Trickett’s paper emphasised the need for Labour to create “a majoritarian coalition” around a “transformational” offer rather than use “retail” politics to appeal to different interest groups. When a general election came, we should make it about the kind of country we wanted to build and why it would serve the interests of the great majority of people, not only those experiencing the most acute symptoms of Tory policies.In time, Lopatin and Bendell would propose replacing “left behind” with “held back”. “Held back” could be applied to a whole range of ways in which most people’s lives are limited by a society run for the rich. We saw it as majoritarian and unifying – it spoke to both sides of the Brexit ide. More than that, it implies a call to action: whereas “left behind” encourages people to think of themselves as victims, “held back” suggests an obstacle to be removed. It prompts questions: what is holding me back, why and how can I do something about it? There was a story emerging here – and, like the best stories, a contradiction that required resolution. Looking back on it, we were all inching towards an approach that would gel around “for the many, not the few” – a suggestion that did not surface until the first full day of the general election campaign.The pressure on Milne and me to make a decision was intense because leaflets were going to print and artwork was needed for the campaign bus. That afternoon, Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) was due to gather for a scheduled meeting and would expect our presentation to answer this most basic of questions. The strapline we had used for the local elections – “standing up for you” – was designed to position candidates as champions of their communities, but it was not applicable to a campaign aiming to win power at Westminster and deliver fundamental change. The idea of people being “held back” was already built into our narrative, as was juxtaposing “a society rigged for the rich” against “one in which people could lead richer lives”. But the two campaign co-ordinators, Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne, were still deeply unhappy about any use of “rich” or “richer”, which had been misinterpreted by some of the participants when tested at focus groups, and almost everything else we toyed with seemed lame and unoriginal.As I pressed on with writing the presentation for the NEC, Milne went to see Gwynne and Lavery to listen to their concerns and discuss other options. The meeting was inconclusive, but Gwynne came back to Loto to continue the brainstorm with Milne by running through past Labour straplines and discussing which ones had worked and which hadn’t. They agreed the 2005 motto “Britain forward, not back” was the worst they could remember, with the 2015 effort “better plan for a better future” not very far behind.As they delved deeper into the past, the words “the many, not the few” from the party’s constitution came up. The phrase was part of a new version of clause IV proposed by Tony Blair and adopted at a special conference in 1995 to replace Labour’s longstanding commitment to “common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. The dropping of the old clause IV was opposed by those of us who saw it as a New Labour move to distance the party from the idea of public ownership. However, the new clause contained phrases that are common ground for all its members, among them the words adapted from Shelley’s poem Masque of Anarchy. It was written in 1819 following the Peterloo massacre at St Peter’s Field, Manchester, when cavalry charged into a crowd of tens of thousands who were demanding the right to vote. For Milne, it felt right to use them again in a different context, and Gwynne agreed.By now it was nearly midday, and my NEC presentation still had a big hole in it. When I scurried into Milne’s room, he said: “What do you think of ‘for the many, not the few’?” It was one of those FFS moments when you realise there’s a good reason why some things stand the test of time – in this case, nearly 200 years. With the word “for” added, the phrase encapsulated the idea of building a society that serves the great majority and not accepting one that is run by and for a privileged elite. It went beyond modifying the way the country is run by making it “fairer” or “better” and implied a transformation to a wholly different way of doing things.Of course, the fact that Blair had used the words complicated this interpretation. Would some people consider it sullied? How could the same slogan apply to a “centrist” platform – whose proponents were “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” – as well as our much more radical one? We hardly had any time to debate these doubts, but would the vast majority of voters know or care about them anyway? My instinct was that most people would not be aware of how “the many, not the few” had been used before and those who did would realise Corbyn – of all people – truly meant the message it embodied.• Extracted from Game Changer: Eight Weeks that Transformed British Politics, published by Accent Press on 18 April (£15.99).

All he’d ever wanted in life was to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony but one thing had led to another and he’d been devastated to wake up one morning to find he was one of the richest people on the planet and that various evil people were doing beastly things on his beloved Facebook.He was trying to stamp it out, he added, attempting the expression his operators had assured him could be interpreted as sincere, though it was a challenge.The first few questions came from committee chair, Greg Walden. Was Facebook a media company? Oh no! It was just a total coincidence it had livestreamed 25 Major League Baseball games. Was Facebook a financial institution? Oh no! It was just a total coincidence people could send each other money through it. Had he ever thought to monetise people’s data? “We don’t sell people’s data,” Zuckerberg said, sounding hurt. There was no need when he could flog so many advertisements instead.Just when it looked as if we might be getting somewhere, Walden called himself to heel. Every questioner was just going to get four minutes each and it was too bad if they had to bail out half way through a promising line of inquiry. The Zuck began to relax and the first hint of a smile crossed his face. This was going to be a doddle after all. Just ramble on in vague generalities to wind the clock down. And if things felt like they were getting a bit tricky either say, “I respectfully disagree” or “that’s too complex to answer here, let me get back to you”.It also turned out that some Republican representatives weren’t even that interested in asking him anything about the data scraping scandal involving Cambridge Analytica that had prompted the hearing in the first place.Joe Barton merely wanted to know why a couple of Conservative bloggers had been shut down on Facebook, while Fred Upton reckoned that more regulation might make life too tricky for start-ups to compete with Facebook. As if they stood a chance.A third Republican used his four minutes to share pictures of his dad while another almost sobbed as he described the amount of money he had raised for charity through Facebook. It was all the Zuck could do to prevent himself from running across the chamber to give these guys a hug. He’d never expected to be asked such intelligent and perceptive questions.The Democrats were a little more forensic but they too were stymied by the four-minute rule. Anna Eshoo tried to narrow things down by asking some yes or no questions, but rather blew it by wasting half her allotted time in a pointless preamble. And even when it looked momentarily as if Zuck was close to being put on the spot all he had to do was drag out his answers. Yes but no but yes but no but yes but no but what was the question again?Just occasionally a few nuggets did come out. We learned that the Zuck’s own data had been mined by Cambridge Analytica, though we didn’t discover what ads pop up for socially awkward, secretive billionaires. We learned that Facebook was thinking about suing Alexander Analytica. Most bizarrely of all, we learned that the Zuck thought there was a huge team of Cambridge University academics hell-bent on undermining Facebook. Needless to say we ran out of time before he was able to expand on that.But mostly we learned exactly what Zuckerberg wanted us to learn. Which was not very much. Just that he was this misunderstood dude who was more sinned against than sinning. This dude who was devastated to find that some people had taken advantage of him but hadn’t quite got round to doing anything about it. This dude who just happened to be CEO of one of the most profitable companies in the world and was giving his best impression of someone who didn’t have a clue how it was run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a822e593b6b96aa9be8f79cf8a0ebf60628f3f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0db320f4516d9d52ed5c771f8302b373 1240w","title":"labour announces plan for under 25s to have free bus travel","story":"Councils opting for publicly owned bus services to get funds partly arising from road taxUnder 25s would have free bus travel under a Labour government, the party said, proposing a scheme that would be paid for by ring-fenced cash arising from road tax.The party said local authorities who moved to introduce public ownership of bus services or franchising would be given the funds to provide free travel. The scheme would incentivise councils to create municipally owned bus companies.The party said its research could help up to 13 million young people save £1,000 a year, based on the average price of a bus ticket in England. The policy would cost £1.4bn a year by the end of a five-year parliament, with franchising or municipalisation of services likely to be staggered. Labour said the funds would use about a fifth of the income from vehicle excise duty revenues, forecast to be £6.7bn in 2021, which is currently allocated to road building. The party said it would widen the hypothecation and use the pledge of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, for a £250bn National Transformation Fund to pay for road building, to be paid for by government borrowing.Jeremy Corbyn will launch the policy at a visit to a sixth form in Derby on Thursday, and is expected to say: “Young people deserve a break. Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working-age households without children. Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel. Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives.”The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the funding would provide an incentive for councils to bring services back into public ownership companies often chose to operate only the most profitable routes, leaving councils to fund the less popular rural routes that were still a key lifeline for communities.“Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long private bus companies have run our services for profit not people,” he said.But the transport minister, Nusrat Ghani, said Labour had “no real ability to deliver” the promise of free travel, suggesting it could cost up to £13bn, which Labour has denied. Ghani said Labour were “bribing young people again with yet another empty promise”, after first promising to abolish tuition fees. “Our balanced approach to the economy means that we are able to help people with the cost of travel by extending railcards to everyone under the age of 30, while councils also have the power to offer cheaper travel for young people.”The Conservatives also criticised the pledge to fund road building from the National Transformation Fund, saying it would mean funding a day-to-day spending commitment with borrowed money.A Labour source said it was nonsense that the policy would cost £13bn, a sum it said was based on the assumption that every person under 25 in the UK would use a bus 10 times a week. Labour’s costs were based on a lower price with services taken in-house and modelled on the free bus passes for elderly people.

From flattened ears to affectionate bum-flashing, a cat behaviouralist reveals what it all meansAs the first cat was domesticated more than 4,000 years ago, you’d think we’d have them figured out by now. But no. We still expect them to fit in with our modern lives with zero compatibility issues, despite the fact that cats are fundamentally solitary hunters so naturally they behave differently – it’s in their DNA. To hone your animal instincts, animal behaviourist, cat expert and author Anneleen Bru decodes cat behaviour for beginners.What they do: rub around your legsWhat it means: ‘I feel good’“Often a cat will do this if you are preparing their food,” says Bru. “It means: ‘I like this person, I feel safe, I’m happy.’”Cats use pheromones in a very clever way – think of it as leaving scented Post-It notes around their core living space. Rubbing against certain furniture is reinforcing a message that it’s their happy place.What they do: flash their bumWhat it means: ‘I like you’When a cat flashes its derriere to another cat they are being really welcoming.“It’s their way of saying to another cat: ‘Hello, I like you,’” explains Bru. “So, when they do that to us, their humans, it means the same thing.”What they do: purrWhat usually means: ‘I’m happy and chilled’What it sometimes means: ‘I’m stressed and in pain’“Mostly, purring is pure contentment, but sometimes it can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or illness. Cats don’t show pain, but they exhibit subtle changes in their behaviour instead. In these instances, purring offers relief to an anxious or stressed cat, in effect they are trying to self-soothe.”Tip: If your cat has always purred and stops, see a vet as it could indicate a health issue. Equally, if it doesn’t normally purr, but starts, see your vet. Any sudden behaviour changes could be a sign your cat needs veterinary treatment.What they do: sleep in weird placesWhat it means: ‘I’m keeping myself safe’“As a solitary hunter, cats like to sleep up high so they are safe and aware of their surroundings,” says Bru. “Sleeping up high, or in hidden places, like cardboard boxes or in cupboards or drawers, is in their DNA. It’s how they survive. Let them do it.”What they do: padWhat it means: ‘I’m chilling and really enjoying myself’“This is real self-soothing behaviour that goes back to kittenhood,” says Bru. “It’s the action that kittens do to release the milk at their mother’s teats, often this action can send them into a real trance and cats will do this until their final years. It’s the epitome of a happy cat.”What they do: close their eyes, while sitting close to youWhat it means: ‘I love you’“This is the equivalent of a cat’s kiss,” says Bru. “If you open your eyes wide and close them while looking at your cat, it’s telling them you love them back. It’s cat whispering. Try it.”What they do: flatten their whiskersWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’Whiskers are super-sensitive radar devices for cats as they struggle to focus on anything an arm’s length from their face. Their long, coarse whiskers have highly sensitive nerve endings at the roots – they can determine if prey is close by and what space is around them.What they do: stare at other catsWhat it means: ‘I hate them’“This is the feline equivalent of giving the other the middle finger,” says Bru. “Don’t ever think that two cats staring at each other is going to lead to anything gentle. It won’t.”What they do: drop their tailWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’“A straight up tail, or one held in a question-mark shape, is the sign of a happy cat,” says Bru. “This is the complete opposite.”What they do: flatten their earsWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’ (sensing a pattern?)The most obvious sign you have an unhappy cat. Combine it with an arched back, bushy coat, flattened ears, erect bushy tail, deep moaning and you have a very, very grumpy cat.What they do: pee in your trainersWhat it means: ‘You need to sort out my litter tray situation’“In the wild, cats will pee and poo in different places,” explains Bru. “A cat is programmed to bury its poo to hide from predators, its pee is less of an issue so it will do that elsewhere. Also, cats prefer to use a litter tray that is high up and hidden so they feel less vulnerable. Look at your litter tray setup and change it accordingly.”What they do: spray urine on vertical areasWhat it means: ‘I’m worried about something in this place’“If not neutered, your cat, male or female, will spray as a sexual marking,” says Bru, “If neutered, this is a stress sign – look at what may have changed in the environment, such as the threat of other (unfamiliar) cats who may be able to enter or stare into the house.”What they do: yawnWhat is means: ‘I’m chilled’Usually a yawn is a relaxed signal of your cat releasing stress and relaxing. This is another chance for you to communicate with them. Yawn back and see what happens.What they do: gently bite you during petting What it means: ‘This is gooood’A gentle nibble means serious appreciation a harder one may suggest your cat is a little over-stimulated, so perhaps give them some space.What they do: bring you dead animalsWhat it means: ‘You’re a terrible hunter’Bringing home a kill is often more common in females than males, some research suggests by bringing home the kill, the cat has adopted you as part of its family and its DNA says it has to feed you and teach you how to hunt. However, it’s also just what they do, cats are hardwired to hunt – some more so than others. Bringing home a kill actually has nothing to do with you, says Bru. “Cats will stalk and kill prey, even when they don’t have the intention of eating it. They will bring it to their core area, because this is where they feel safe.”You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

She reflects on the hard-won highs that come with sharing a home – and a heart – with a felineIf cats are capricious, the humans who love them are worse. To be a cat lover is to embrace confusion, rejection, austerity, frustration and chaos. To share your home with a cat is to seek comfort, beauty, affection and joy, but accept that such delights will be tightly rationed, allocated seemingly at random, and frequently withheld altogether. Cat lovers are philosophers, poets and perverts, and I wouldn’t be anything else.Contrary as they are, cat lovers mistrust the undiscerning affection and allegiance of dogs. Naturally it’s possible to appreciate all animals, and I genuinely love dogs, but when a labrador bounds up to me like I’m some sort of human holy grail, I’m reminded of the words of Groucho Marx: “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.”My cat, Elvis, by contrast, makes me feel like I have something to prove. Elvis keeps me on my toes he holds me accountable for my actions. My cat makes me want to be a better human. And, like all pack animals, I respond well to being kept in check by my tiny furry overlord.It’s been six months since Elvis came into my life, as an eight-month-old black longhair rescue. Speaking to the shelter, I explained that I didn’t care about colour, age or gender, but specifically requested a “dog-cat”. Dog-cats share some of the genial qualities more regularly attributed to a dog, by being social, confident and affectionate. Throughout my childhood, my mother excelled at selecting dog-cats: non-skittish, friendly little moggies who could handle the aggressive adulation and clumsy affection of three small children. Gingie, Coke and Parsley were all dog-cats. Now I’m an adult, I made certain that the first cat I chose was a dog-cat.Elvis waits by the window when I return home from work in the evening. He thoughtfully inspects every new visitor to my flat, as if they are a second-hand Volvo he’s considering purchasing. He’s every inch the alpha, striding confidently into the room, announcing his presence with a succession of meows.Green-eyed, long-haired and graceful, at times Elvis resembles a moving sculpture, and he is quite the prettiest object in my home. He’s also a breathing, purring hot water bottle, and his weight, warmth and rhythmic breathing make my shoulders slacken and my pulse slow at the end of a frantic day. He frequently makes me laugh out loud, play-fighting with my left foot, lolling voluptuously on the sofa, or playing football with purloined biros across the wooden floorboards. Sometimes he glares at me with barely disguised contempt and disapproval, when I come home late, smelling of another animal. It’s nice to know that he cares enough to be cross.But Elvis allows me my independence. I’m permitted my frequent work trips, providing that I supply a temporary giant slave woman during my absence. When I come back, I stretch out on the sofa and he falls asleep on my chest, and then I know that the cat-sitter has not replaced me in his affections. One of the joys of owning a cat is building these little rituals together. Rituals that nobody else understands but Elvis and I.Adopting a rescue cat like Elvis makes the owner-cat journey even more of an emotional melodrama. I watched him grow from being a slightly cagey kitten to a confident, strutting alpha cat.

The treatment is expected to cost $300 for 12 weeks, or $3.50 per day, in Malaysia, where trials were conducted along with Thailand – a fraction of the cost of other hepatitis C medicines produced by major drugmakers, which often run to tens of thousands of dollars. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), a not-for-profit organisation, is working with the Egyptian drugmaker Pharco Pharmaceuticals to bring a combination treatment of two hepatitis C tablets, ravidasvir ­(a new drug)­ and sofosbuvir, to countries that cannot afford to pay the high prices charged by US companies Gilead and AbbVie. This is taking longer than expected but has moved a big step closer with the latest results. The interim results of the phase IIIII trial of 301 people will be presented in Paris on Thursday. It has been funded by Médecins Sans Frontières, one of DNDi’s founding partners which also include France’s Institut Pasteur. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer and death. It affects more than 71 million people worldwide and causes 400,000 deaths a year. Although highly effective medicines have been available for several years, their high cost means that less than three million people are on treatment.US drugmaker Gilead has lowered the price of its Harvoni tablet and other medicines in lower and middle-income countries, but it is still too high for governments to roll out mass hepatitis C treatment programmes.Harvoni now costs about $48,000 for a 12-week course in Malaysia and $12,000 in Chile. Gilead’s previous Sovaldi treatment cost $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 over 12 weeks. Prices vary around the world and tend to be highest in the US.Gilead has come under pressure from US rival AbbVie, which launched a new hepatitis C medicine, Mavyret, last year with a shorter, eight-week treatment course priced at $26,400. Bernard Pécoul, executive director of DNDi, said: “The results indicate that the sofosbuvirravidasvir combination is comparable to the very best hepatitis C therapies available today but it is priced affordably and could allow an alternative option in countries excluded from pharmaceutical company access programmes.” The treatment is expected to be available in Malaysia within one to two years. DNDi has also signed deals in Latin America to make it available for $500 for the 12 week course, with a provision to bring the price down to $300.The trial using medicines produced by Pharco was run by DNDi and co-sponsored by the Malaysian Ministry of Health.DNDi has licensed rights for ravidasvir in low and middle income countries from the Californian firm that developed it, Presidio Pharmaceuticals. The UK has an estimated 215,000 hepatitis C cases, while the US has 3.4m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7dea38daebd0978bf15990a184adb46ac81b4e6/0_162_3328_1998/master/3328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bb1e80aaa93c3dc35c18367945673cce 1240w","title":"grand national meeting foxhunters test soft ground","story":"• Foxhunters’ Chase will give clues for Grand National day• Nicky Henderson likely to retain title as champion trainerThe Grand National meeting at Aintree will open on Thursday with four consecutive Grade One races and several of the sport’s best chasers and hurdlers in action, but it is the fifth event on the card – a hunter chase – that may be studied most closely by the punters ahead of the biggest betting race of the year on Saturday.The word ‘heavy’ no longer appears in the going description for the Grand National course after a dry night on Tuesday and the track was “quietly drying out” on Wednesday according to Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course. How quietly should become apparent when 22 runners are due to go to post for the Foxhunters’ Chase a few hours after the final declarations are made for the National itself.A slow-motion finish will be taken as final confirmation that the National on Saturday will be the most demanding test since the famous fences were modified with plastic cores before the 2013 renewal.“It’s still a bit soggy down at the Canal Turn,” Tulloch said on Wednesday. “That’s always the wettest bit on the course. It should be mainly dry on Thursday, just overcast and cloudy all the way through with some drizzle in the morning.Thursday’s field for the Foxhunters’ is well short of the race’s safety limit of 30, which should take a little of the edge off the race’s potential for drama and mayhem. But it still seems sure to be a fierce examination both for the horses and their amateur riders, and one in which the huge experience of Derek O’Connor could prove vital aboard Balnaslow (4.05).O’Connor is an amateur jockey in name only, as his winning ride on Edwulf in this season’s Irish Gold Cup demonstrated. He has completed the course on all three of his previous starts in this race, finishing runner‑up twice including a one‑and‑three‑quarter length defeat on his mount 12 months ago, and has an obvious chance to finally add the “amateurs’ National” on his record.The only disappointment after the Cheltenham Gold Cup last month was that the extended duel between Native River and Might Bite had to have a loser. The two horses staged a magnificent spectacle as they fought out a private battle from the off, and with Native River in summer quarters Might Bite (2.50) should have a straightforward path to victory in the opening day’s feature chase, the Grade One Betway Bowl.Nicky Henderson, Might Bite’s trainer, is all but certain to retain his title as champion trainer, a feat he last achieved 31 years ago, and he has several more runners with clear chances in the day’s remaining Grade One events.His perennial rival Paul Nicholls has several live runners on the card too, however, and both Cyrname (1.45), in the Manifesto Novice Chase and Malaya (2.20) in the Anniversary Juvenile Hurdle have realistic opportunities to give their trainer his first Grade One success of 2018.The gamble on Katie Walsh’s mount Baie Des Iles for the Grand National continued on Wednesday, and the grey is now top-priced at 16-1 (from 20-1) having been available at 66-1 last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e37c0d37fbf1bb62c3512ecef96bda0f864d1b/0_0_3500_2172/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=533abb8c21f54dd1a21478ca7010f4c4 1400w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day eight beach volleyball gymnastics and more live","story":"Wow, some finish, with McHugh and Schumann taking victory. Jubilant scenes around the court. Ice running through their veins in what was a mightily nervy, tense finish. That’s gold number 59 for the Aussies ...Another magic moment as Schumann nips over the net to pull Australia back into it, before rifling an ace over to get the scores back to 12-12 in the third set. It’s going to be a nervy finish, with both nations locked on points in this gold medal match on the sand. A reminder that England won their first ever Commonwealth Games medals in the women’s mountain biking this morning, with Annie Last taking gold. “This an amazing feeling,” she said. “Thank you to everybody who has helped me along the road.”That beach volleyball clash between two heavyweights, Australia and Canada, is still unfolding. Canada take the second set 21-18 with Chris McHugh struggling to deal with a smashing forehand. His partner, Schumann has played a blinder, though, and it’s level at 1-1. There’s a toss of a coin to see who will win the serve, and decide the ends. Hello. What’s coming up in this bumper day eight? The main focus is again, like yesterday, in the track and field, with 10 medals to come at the Carrara Stadium alone, including the men’s 200m and 800m finals. There’s also more ing, with the 3m springboard and the 10m platform final, with Jack Laugher, of England, the Olympic champion returning in the former after victory yesterday in the 1m. Plus, beach volleyball and wrestling.Talking of the sand, here’s a dispatch from Martha Kelner:Well look, it’s all too much for your humble correspondent here. Richard Parkin signing off to go bathe my typing fingers and enjoy a nice crisp glass of milk.You’ll be in excellent hands though as the indefatigable Ben Fisher takes over the joystick. Thanks for your company today from the lawn bowls to the mountain biking and now to the beach volleyball – what a day of close encounters it has been!A huge night (in Australia) still in store, so keep that sly browser open and your alt-tab fingers at the ready in the office this morning wherever in the world you’re following this coverage.Well, it’s the type of encounter you’d hope for with gold on the line, so far. We’re halfway through the first set and it’s Australia leading 11-10, in a contest that’s ebbed and flowed.Sam Pedlow has been really firing in his serves today, cracking 80+km on multiple occasions, but the Aussie duo are scrambling well.A bit of verbals here with Canada challenging the umpires call, with the score blowing out to 15-12 to the host nation. The reply shows Pedlow was absolutely correct, it’s just touched the tape – how crucial could this prove?!The point is revoked, and then Canada move to lock it up at 14-14. And they’ve got a bit of momentum here, taking the lead 16-15. Australia respond with a tactical time out.It’s a vocal home crowd, but McHugh and Schumann need to make sure they don’t get too overwrought by the energy on the Coolangatta beachfront.Very delicately poised here now as Damian Schumann conceals a delicate drop shot, before Chris McHugh fires an unstoppable serve. They head back into the lead, 18-17!Wowee – what a point that was Australia leading 19-18 and the teams have produced the rally of the game! It ends with a Schumann spike, and Australia go 20-18.Pedlow then saves one set-point but it’s there! To the delight of the home crowd, Canada have conceded their first set of the tournament, and Australia go to their seats for a well-earned drink, grabbing the first 21-19.Back at the Coomera Indoor Sports Centre where Cyprus’ Evripidou has navigated her third rotation with aplomb in the rhythmic gymnastics. A slight fumble with the clubs, but not obvious errors and the Cypriot has come through with a very credible 13.850. She won’t top the round, but she doesn’t cede too much ground to Canada’s Uchida, with one apparatus left to complete.Some fascinating choices of music in this round too – Canada’s Sophie Crane with the classic styles of the Can Can, as performed by London’s Philharmonic Orchestra, Singapore’s Aiko Tan feeling a little bit more Pitbull \u0026amp J-Lo inclined. No deductions from the judges for that error though, you’ll be relieved to hear.Well, they started strongly and they finished in similar fashion, the brothers from Aeteroa have ended the run of England’s Sheaf and Gregory, 21-13, 21-15.Some terrific fight from the English duo who at one stage looked like they were out of answers, as Messieurs O’Dea wracked up 6-7 unanswered points, to finish more respectably.Sam O’Dea leading the way from the net with eight blocks – the 6 ft 6 and taller of the two has led the tournament for blocks, so a sense of reprieve for the Kiwis after a disappointing loss in the semi-final with Canada.Canada are on the sand now as they take on Australia’s Chris McHugh and Damien Schumann in the gold medal battle. Watch this space!Well, what a routine that was! Already sitting nicely after the hoop routine, Cyprus’s Diamanto Evripidou has blown away her opponents with a stunning performance with the ball. She impressed in qualification and came in as the favourite but it’s one thing doing it away from the cameras and doing it when it matters.It’s an apparatus the Cypriot favours but the judges have awarded her a 15.100 – for context the next best was Wales’ Laura Halford with a 13.300 – so at the halfway point Evripidou sits with 28.900, with Canada’s Uchida a full 1.650 points behind and Malaysia’s Sie Yan Koi in third.We’re nearing the end of the first set in the men’s beach volleyball, where English duo Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf have a battle of their hands in the form of Kiwi brothers Ben and Sam O’Dea.If you missed Martha Kelner’s piece, there’s been quite a remarkable road to get here for the English team, and there are definitely plenty in the crowd here roaring the popular duo on.It’s 12-19 to the Kiwis however who are looking to round out this first set. New Zealand miss a chance or two to close it, but a big block by Ben O’Dea at the net and they’ve clinched it 21-13. A big twenty minutes coming up here on the sands of Coolangatta.Around the grounds – and a Bolt from the blue!So, a quick skirt around what else is currently going down. We’re down to the round of 16 clashes in the badminton, Wales has edged Ghana for 9th place in the women’s hockey after a 2-0 shoot out victory, South Africa has shaded England for the bronze in the triple’s para lawn bowls 16-13, 5th-10th places have been resolved in the netball with South Africa ending the tournament of surprise packets Uganda to claim 5th, Malawi have grabbed 7th over Northern Ireland and Scotland have just downed Barbados to finish 9th.In the rhythmic gymnastics Canada’s Katherine Uchida is the provisional leader at the conclusion of the hoop element, with the Cypriot duo of Viktoria Skittidi and Diamanto Evripidou in second and third. England’s Hannah Martin and Australia’s Enid Sung are in 5th and 6th respectively, with a plethora of squash and table tennis events still on the go.In terms of medals, the only breaking news is a gold to Singapore’s appropriately named Martina Veloso who made quick work of her opposition in the women’s 50m rifle prone final. India’s Tejaswini Sawant and Scotland’s Seonaid McIntosh claimed silver and bronze, but it was Veloso with a Games record score that won the day, backing up her earlier win in the 10m rifle to deliver Singapore its second gold of the Games!Oh, and breaking news that half of the Games journalists have been seen abandoning their posts with news that Usain Bolt has made an appearance at the media centre. We’ll await to see if our eyes at the scene, the redoutable Mike Hytner, will be able to secure a selfie or at least ask a question like “Mr Bolt, where did you learn to run so fast?” etc. You do not want to go to the bathroom any time soon.Women’s heptathlon – disaster for Stainton, KJT leadsAn update now from the track where we’re two events down in the women’s heptathlon.Gold medal favourite England’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson has taken an early lead with the conclusion of the 110m hurdles and high jump elements.Australian Celeste Mucci led after the hurdles from Canada’s Angela Whyte with Johnson-Thompson finishing fifth, but disaster for her compatriot Katie Stainton, whose entire event was over inside five seconds after a very nasty fall.A distraught Stainton was comforted by KJT as she discovered that she’d been subsequently disqualified for not finishing.KJT then cleared 1.87m in the high jump to take the overall lead from Canada’s Nina Schultz, with Mucci in third.What a battle this has become. We were all waiting for the fireworks between the defending champion and the silver medallist from the Glasgow Games, but it took a very unexpected turn, with Sam Gaze suffering a mechanical!The last thing you want as three cyclists close at the medals end of the race. Cooper attacks, he sees the opportunity and he drops Hatherly to see if he can ride to the finish there’s still about a circuit left to race.Gaze loses about 30 seconds, and he’s staring at now having to come through the South African to get back on the tail of Cooper.It looks Cooper’s from here but would you believe, Gaze is going for this! Hatherly very sportingly allows his opponent past him – he could have used the narrow section of the course to block and frustrate, but he’s left him past. Nervous times for Cooper now as Gaze is absolutely mowing him down. What a ride this is turning into!They’re into the velodrome now, it’s elbow-to-elbow, the two Kiwis are really throwing their machines about, who has the top end pace to finish this? Gaze is the quicker of the two, but has he expended too much energy with that remarkable catch up ride!They’re on the final stretch and it’s Gaze, it’s Gaze with the jump! What a remarkable ride he’s mown his compatriot down and now he’s grabbed the gold!What an awkward busride home that’s going to be – but it’s New Zealand gold and silver, with South Africa’s Hatherly grabbing the bronze. High mountain-biking drama in Nerang!Wowee. What a spectacular finish to the gold medal antipodean clash over at Broadbeach!We left it with the Kiwis deliberating long and hard but would you believe with the very last bowl of the match Australia have snatched the result!It was the veteran, Ken Hanson, on the 15th end with a clutch bowl. Sixty-eight years young he’s become Australia’s oldest ever Commonwealth Games gold medallist!Commiserations to the Kiwi trio, they fought so valiantly, but they’ll have to settle for the silver. High bowling drama!We’re back with the men’s cross-country mountain biking, where it’s turned into a three-horse race with third of the Kiwi triumvirate Oliver off the back. Ciao, Lepidus, it’s time for Octavian and Mark Antony to battle out the rest of this one.South Africa’s Hatherly continues to be the fly in the ointment on a New Zealand 1-2-3, he’s lurking with intent with the medallists from Glasgow appear to be more concerned with marking each others’ attacks.Australia’s McConnell appears to have slipped off the chasing pack, so the Glasgow bronze medallist is out of the reckoning here. England’s Clacherty and Canada’s Bouchard remain locked around a minute back as they joustle for fourth and fifth.It’s Cooper still leading, with Gaze on his shoulder, Hatherly sitting back, patiently watching them both.We’ve got a humdinger over at Broadbeach Bowls Club as well, as two other tiny islands with great sporting antagonism are locked in a classic. With only one end to play it’s Australia 12, New Zealand 13 here.The Kiwis took an early lead, before Australia pushed out to a very comfortable lead, 10-3 after seven ends. A remarkable five-point end brought New Zealand charging back into this contest, and they’ve really quietened this parochial home crowd snatching the lead, right at the death! How will this one unfold?! There’s some tense tactic talk happening between every bowl. Do the Kiwis drive? Do they bowl close? Do they protect the shot ball?And we’re about half-way through the event over at Nerang, where it’s New Zealand poised nicely at this stage to dominate the medals.South Africa’s Alan Hatherly is the odd one out with a Kiwi trio of Anton Cooper, Sam Gaze and Ben Oliver hunting as a pack.There’s almost a minute between our leading pack and the rest of the field, with England’s Fraser Clacherty, Australia’s Dan McConnell and Canada’s Leandre Bouchard leading their nations’ hopes respectively.Tasty little Guernsey v Jersey subplot here by the way, with the battle for the channels taking place about 3 minutes back in 10-12th place.Some great names on some of the technical elements of this course, by the way, let’s hope none of the riders come unstuck on ‘Grumpy Wombat Hollow’ etc.Cooper and Gaze battled it out for gold and silver at the Glasgow Games, will we see a repeat of that battle here today?And to take stock of where the overall medal tally is presently at:It continues to be a brighter than perhaps even expected showing for the host nation, with local reporters crowing over Australia’s dominance in the pool, even against the various countries of Great Britain when combined.Over thirty nations have now got among the medals, but there are plenty of intriguing battles within battles. Which of the channel islands, you ask, will breakthrough first, as Guernsey and Jersey resume their ancient hatred. Don’t expect any assistance on that front from Sark – they didn’t even front for the games, the slackers.Still, plenty more action to come – and as we’ve seen already, dramatic upsets are never far away, such is the drama of the Commonwealth Games.Kia ora koutou! It’s another day of radiant sunshine Down Under and there’s plenty more gold to go around today.If you missed some of the overnight action it was a terrific night led by Australia’s field athletes, a strong night for England’s ing team, with Tracey Neville’s netballers also daring to dream of gold.Martha Kelner’s also got a lovely write-up of England’s beach volleyball duo Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf and the adversity they’ve overcome even just to make the Games, plus Kate O’Halloran’s terrific feature on how these Games have strived for LGBTI inclusivity.Here’s what’s still to come on day eight. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.Our first gold of the morning has gone to England in the women’s cross-country mountain bike, and right now (very now) their male counterparts are taking to the course over in Nerang.Rhythmic gymnastics is underway from 2pm local, and Chris Gregory and Jake Sheaf (see above) will be fighting for bronze in the men’s beach volleyball from 3.30pm, with the gold-medal clash between Australia and Canada starting around 4.30pm.There are netball and hockey classification games to resolve with table tennis getting to the pointy end as well, before a flurry of gold is up for grabs in the men’s and women’s wrestling.So plenty going on, and as always we’ll cover"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d7a75b0b8074d44df62bf71e983a14117b6ba4/4_731_3220_1933/master/3220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=511308c783131ec20610b9ae766e5203 1240w","title":"chicago review cuba gooding jr phoenix theatre london","story":"Phoenix theatre, LondonKander and Ebb’s show about crime and celebrity is faithfully recreated but is beginning to resemble an animated corpseIf this Kander and Ebb musical feels as if it has been with us for ever, that is because it has. It premiered in 1975, directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, and was given a more minimalist revival by Walter Bobbie that bowed on Broadway in 1996 and came to London a year later. It is that version, now starring several Chicago veterans as well as Cuba Gooding Jr, that has been faithfully recreated and, while it is done with great professional skill, it is beginning to resemble an animated corpse. That image is appropriate since the show is all about death: speaking of Chicago in the 1920s, it argues that “in this town murder is a form of entertainment”. Using the form of a Brechtian vaudeville, Kander and Ebb follow the story of Roxie Hart, a small-time hoofer who shoots her lover and exploits her mythical pregnancy to escape the rap. Fame, however, is fleeting and Roxie soon finds that she is yesterday’s news. Her solution is to go into partnership with another headline-seeking killer, Velma Kelly, and form a touring sister act. The show is harsh, cynical and funny and chimes well with an age that understands the psychotic nature of celebrity. I’m all for reviving old musicals, but this one has not been imaginatively rethought. Tania Nardini and Gary Chryst are credited, respectively, with recreating the 1996 direction and dance. But even in 1996’s revival, the choreography by Ann Reinking was “in the style of Bob Fosse”. His trademarks are still visible: the men sport tilted bowlers, there is much jutting of the bum and thrusting of the pelvis, and chairs are dragged backwards across the stage. He was a highly inventive choreographer but here the dance begins to feel not so much Fosse-ised as ossified. Even if the production is a carbon copy, performers bring iniduality. Sarah Soetaert invests Roxie with the elfin mischief of a naughty schoolgirl who, eyeing up the rippling muscles of the male chorus, coos: “These are my boys.” Josefina Gabrielle, another Chicago regular, plays Velma as the more hard-bitten of the two and does some impressive spins, twirls and high-kicks. As the self-seeking lawyer, Billy Flynn, Gooding Jr displays too much surface charm and sings modestly but hoofs energetically. Meanwhile, Ruthie Henshall, who played Roxie in London in 1997, now zestfully executes the role of the jail den-mother and Paul Rider inevitably scoops up the sympathy as Roxie’s discarded husband in a number, Mr Cellophane, celebrating his invisibility. The lead actors all do their stuff, the ensemble is lively and the onstage band, under the direction of Ian Townsend, is exceptional: the evening’s best moment comes when the brass are given the spotlight at the start of the second act. But, while it is pleasant to renew acquaintance with numbers such as All That Jazz and Razzle Dazzle, everything is exactly as I remember it from 1997: that includes the chilling moment when a rope descends from the flies as a Hungarian girl dies protesting her innocence to remind us of the reality of judicial murder. For all the cast’s commitment, this is as much a piece of museum theatre as those old Soviet shows that went unchanged through the decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b60f66a2528f3e4ad5d96e422a547acba0e026f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3100eabec0dd32a5326760c102b3b453 1240w","title":"best films standup king comedy funny bones maxine peake funny cow","story":"As Maxine Peake takes the mic to play a club comic in Funny Cow, here are five movies that capture the lacerating, soul-baring world of live comedyThere’s something so intimate, exposing and ruthless about their artform that standups make perfect symbols for the battle we all wage to assert ourselves against an unappreciative world. So most movies about standup focus on failures rather than successes – none more so than King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro’s less celebrated follow-up to Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.Here is a film that spotlights the idea of standups as tormented souls, walking personality disorders in spinning bow ties. De Niro is the gag man in question, whose career frustrations, mental ill-health and obsession with TV talkshow host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) lead him to kidnapping and bribery-at-gunpoint. De Niro reportedly powered up for the film by gigging in New York comedy clubs – which is dedication, when you’re obliged only to attain mediocrity. Because Rupert Pupkin (when we finally see him in action) is a very mediocre standup – albeit one whose hunger for fame is oddly heroic (“Better to be king for a night than schmuck for a lifetime!”). The antihero of The King of Comedy is the patron saint of anyone who ever tried to heal their psychic wounds (or book a seat on Graham Norton’s sofa) by picking up the mic.In the UK at least, the centre of the live comedy world is the Edinburgh fringe – and no one even tried to capture it in a feature film until Annie Griffin made Festival. While it looks at the world’s biggest arts jamboree through a wide-angle lens, this ensemble black comedy – Robert Altman is the usual point of comparison – focuses on comedy, and comedians, in particular. Stephen Mangan is the neurotic star standup, revisiting Edinburgh to judge that year’s comedy awards. Chris O’Dowd is the Irish journeyman who’ll stop at nothing to get nominated. Lucy Punch is the wannabe, given to road-testing her Jewish mother character act at the least opportune moments.Nothing about the film adds lustre to the comedy profession: it’s a jaundiced take on how the fringe has surrendered to corporate comedy, by a director whose sympathies clearly lie with arty theatre-makers and Canadian improvisers. But there’s no denying the potency – or veracity – of its account of fringe comedy as a viper’s nest of anxiety and cut-throat competition. What does it mean to be funny? Can you inherit, learn or buy it? Peter Chelsom’s cult 1995 curio teases out these questions, and pays eccentric tribute to the halcyon days of British music hall while doing so. The film tells the story of Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt) – whom we meet bombing on stage in Vegas in the humiliating presence of his dad, the superstar comic George (Jerry Lewis, again). Tommy duly flees to his childhood home of Blackpool to rediscover his “funny bones” – by hook, crook or (more likely) chequebook.There follows an eccentric celebration of vaudeville, featuring an array of eccentric cabaret acts, and a movie debut from the young Lee Evans, as Tommy’s long-lost half-brother Jack. Like many cine-standups, Jack is both extraordinarily gifted and deeply troubled. He also has “funny bones”, as per the description advanced by Lewis’s George in the film’s key confrontation. “There are two types of comedian,” he tells his son: “There’s a funny bones comedian and a non-funny bones comedian. They’re both funny. One is funny, the other tells funny.” I’m arguing for a broad definition of standup by including Milos Forman’s biopic of US comic (or should that be performance artist?) Andy Kaufman. As he says in the film: “I’m not a comedian, I don’t want to go for cheap laughs.” Some – Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw among them – would say I’m overindulging a too-reverent and conventional movie. But from a field that includes Bob Fosse’s Lenny and Richard Pryor’s thinly veiled autobiography Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling, Man on the Moon – starring Jim Carrey as Kaufman – is probably the most successful biopic of a real-life comedian.And what a comedian! The story of Kaufman’s life can’t help but be interesting, because of the sheer oddity of what he did on and offstage. It’s all represented here: the faux-naive Foreign Man the obnoxious lounger singer Tony Clifton the stint as a wrestler. (Fans of Clifton are referred to Rick Alverson’s 2015 movie Entertainment, featuring his anti-comedy inheritor Neil Hamburger.) Every standup movie has a moment when an uncomprehending audience withholds its laughter. But Forman’s film makes a symphony of those awkward silences that soundtracked Kaufman’s career. For a study in comedy as an attritional artform, in how unfunny – when dialled far enough around the scale – can be the funniest thing of all, Man on the Moon has plenty to offer. “What’s so great about you,” the standup heroine of Obvious Child is told, “is that you are unapologetically yourself on stage.” But is that such a great thing? How honest about your emotional life – and those who populate it – is it appropriate to be with a microphone in your hand? Those are hot topics at a time when the comic Louise Reay is being sued by her ex-husband for using material about their marriage in a show. And they’re very much at the heart of director Gillian Robespierre’s indie flick – although the chat surrounding this movie on its release concerned its status as “the abortion romcom”.Like last year’s Stand Up Girl!, starring the Belgian-Muslim comic Nawell Madani, it’s a rare instance of a film about a female comedian. Lead character Donna is an autobiographical standup who mediates her personal life through the stage. And its star Jenny Slate is herself a standup. From the opening scene, when Donna alienates her boyfriend by broadcasting relationship intimacies from the stage, to the later scene when she announces her planned abortion to a paying audience, here is an unaffected study of how comedy isn’t just a means of reporting your emotional life, but of living it."},{"url":null,"title":"zuckerberg hearing facebook tracking questions house back foot","story":"In his second day on Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg says his own data was handed to Cambridge AnalyticaThe Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, was given a rougher ride on his second day of congressional testimony on Wednesday as he faced sharp questions about the tech giant’s ability to track its users’ movements, shopping habits and browsing histories and was at one stage compared to J Edgar Hoover.During five hours of testimony, the billionaire entrepreneur revealed that his own personal information was among that handed over to the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their permission. The Democratic congresswoman Anna Eshoo, reading questions from her constituents at a hearing of the House energy and commerce committee, asked Zuckerberg whether his data was “included in the data sold to the malicious third parties”. After a brief hesitation, the Facebook CEO replied: “Yes.” Eshoo called Facebook’s terms and conditions around privacy a “minefield” and asked Zuckerberg one of many blunt questions put to him on Wednesday: “Are you willing to change your business model to protect users’ privacy?”Zuckerberg, 33, gave one of many evasive responses: “Congresswoman, I’m not sure what that means.”On Tuesday, Facebook began notifying millions of people around the world that their private information may have been given to Cambridge Analytica in the worst privacy debacle in his company’s history. Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper.The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by the Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan. The Democratic congressman Eliot Engel of New York asked if Facebook planned to sue Kogan, Cambridge University or Cambridge Analytica.Zuckerberg said legal action was being considered and added: “What we found now is that there’s a whole programme associated with Cambridge University where … there were a number of other researchers building similar apps. We do need to understand whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us.”Zuckerberg was presumably referring to Cambridge University’s psychometrics centre, which media reports have suggested worked with Cambridge Analytica on ways to predict human behaviour, although the university denies this.Zuckerberg was widely considered to have emerged more or less unscathed from his near five-hour appearance before a joint Senate committee on Tuesday in what had been billed as a moment of reckoning for Silicon Valley. He was rarely thrown off his talking points by middle-aged senators who frequently displayed their lack of tech expertise.But on Wednesday members of the House were more punchy and willing to interrupt his flow as they asked questions on privacy, surveillance, censorship and politics, regularly asking for yes or no answers which he struggled to provide. Republican Marsha Blackburn said: “I can’t let you filibuster right now.” John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, said: “Facebook is becoming a self-regulated superstructure for political discourse. Are we, the American people, going to regulate the political dialogue or are you, Mark Zuckerberg?”The Democrat Frank Pallone asked Zuckerberg to make a clear commitment to change all Facebook’s default settings to minimise the possible collection of personal data. The Facebook founder declined to give a simple response, saying: “Congressman, this is a complex issue that I think deserves more than a one-word answer.” Pallone replied: “That’s disappointing to me.”Mike Doyle, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, raised the Cambridge Analytica matter and asked: “When the Guardian made the report, was that the first time you heard about it?” He accused Facebook of “turning a blind eye” to developers’ abuses, adding: “There is a real trust gap here. This developer data issue is just one example. Why should we trust you to follow through on these promises?”Zuckerberg answered: “Respectfully, I disagree with that characterisation. We’ve had a review process for apps for years. We’ve reviewed tens of thousands of apps a year.”The Florida Democrat Kathy Castor told the CEO: “A devil’s bargain has been struck. Americans do not like to be manipulated. They do not like to be spied on. Facebook now has evolved to a place where you are tracking everyone. You are collecting data on just about everybody … I don’t think the average American really understands that. You’re following Facebook users even after they log off that platform.”Zuckerberg tried to reply, “Broadly, I disagree with your characterisation,” but was frequently cut off by Castor. She demanded: “You are collecting personal data on people who are not Facebook users. Yes or no?”Zuckerberg failed to give a yes or no response and was again interrupted. Castor said: “You watch where we go. Isn’t that correct?”He said: “Everyone has control over how that works.” But again Castor interjected: “Are you saying you don’t gather data on where people travel?”She added: “It’s practically impossible these days to remain untracked in America. And that’s not part of the bargain.”Several other members of the House committee pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook was transparent about much information it collects on users and even non-users. Some tech analysts following proceedings from afar picked holes in his testimony, accusing him of conflating different points on the issue of whether users own and control their data.The technologist and reporter Ashkan Soltani tweeted: “Zuck’s answer to Rep McNerney’s question re: ‘Facebook’s collection of browsing history’ was disingenuous. Facebook *does* track browsing behavior via social widgets. However are not stored as inidual websites but instead as ‘interest categories’.”The Republican David McKinley presented screenshots of opioids available to buy on Facebook without a prescription. “Your platform is still being used to circumvent the law,” he said: “Facebook is enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people … You said before you were going to take down those ads, but you didn’t do it.”Zuckerberg repeated his belief that artificial intelligence was needed to help police activity on Facebook.The Democrat Jan Schakowsky of Illinois also gave Zuckerberg an uncomfortable moment by reading aloud various apologies he had issued in the past for mistakes. “You have a long list of apologies,” she said. “This is proof to me that self-regulation simply does not work.”Indeed, questions of greater regulation of the tech industry have run through the two days of hearings. Zuckerberg acknowledged: “The internet is growing in importance around the world in people’s lives and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation but I also think that you have to be careful about regulation you put in place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

This is Martin Farrer. If you’re just getting up, or have been on the go for hours, the morning briefing is just for you. Theresa May will discuss possible British military action against Syria with her cabinet today after summoning ministers for an emergency meeting. She has not ruled out committing Britain to joining the US and France in a show of force without consulting MPs, but says the weekend chemical attack on Douma “cannot go unchallenged”. The standoff between the western allies and Russia worsened yesterday after the US president, Donald Trump, ramped up the rhetoric by tweeting that Russia should expect an American missile attack on Syria. “Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ ” he said. Russia responded by saying it does not conduct diplomacy by Twitter. Our diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, says that Trump’s remarks are a dangerous development and “unlike anything seen from a US president in modern history”. In another possible escalation, Mike Pompeo, the CIA director set to become the next US secretary of state, will signal later today that years of soft US policy toward Russia are “now over”. In prepared remarks to the Senate, he will say the Trump administration considers Russia “a danger to our country”.Back in Syria, our correspondent Martin Chulov reports that US intelligence operatives have been racing to smuggle corpses out of Douma in order to establish what kind of chemical agent was used along with chlorine in the attack which killed 45 people.Brexit housing woe – The fall in the housing market could hurt the wider economy and influence the Bank of England to hold off on increasing interest rates, according to the latest survey from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. In its gloomiest assessment for five years, the estate agents’ group says demand from buyers fell for the 12th month in a row and the national price balance was the lowest since 2013. One agent said “stamp duty and Brexit” had killed fluidity in the London market, while another said the rental market was also suffering from a glut of properties.‘Thanks but no thanks’ – Yulia Skripal, the Russian woman targeted in a poison attack in Salisbury, has said she doesn’t need any help from her country’s embassy in the UK. Skripal, who was poisoned with her father, a former double agent, made the comments in a statement issued through the police as she continues to recover from the attack last month. She also asked her cousin, Viktoria, not to try to visit her after the woman indicated in the Russian media that she might travel to the UK. The political dimension of the case will take another step today when a summary of a report into the case by the international chemical weapons watchdog will be published.Zuckerberg on the back foot – US congressmen and women must have had the Capitol Hill equivalent of Alex Ferguson’s halftime hairdryer treatment after they dropped Tuesday’s softly-softly approach and started asking Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg much more searching questions on the second day of his grilling in Washington. Although the billionaire founder remained evasive – at one point claiming he didn’t understand a straightforward question about his business model – he was put on the spot about privacy and forced to admit that his personal information was among that farmed by Cambridge Analytica. He was also compared to the notorious FBI boss, J Edgar Hoover, who spent decades spying on American politicians, celebrities and ordinary citizens.‘Stop the harassment’ – Susan Fowler, the former Uber software engineer whose blogpost about sexual harassment sparked a wider movement for gender equality, is using her accidental cachet to campaign against a practice known as “forced arbitration”. This allows companies to push employee complaints into secretive hearings about workplace disputes, silence victims and often protect serial offenders. In an interview with the Guardian, Fowler, whose fame extended to featuring on the cover of Time magazine, says: “This would be the biggest thing you could do to stop the cycle of harassment, discrimination and retaliation in the workplace.”Miracle baby – A remarkable story from China where a baby boy has been born four years after his parents died in a car crash. Shen Jie and Liu Xi were in the middle of IVF treatment when they were killed, leaving their parents to fight a long legal battle for the custody of the remaining embryos.

The centre left’s decision to embrace the discipline of the global marketplace since 1990 has been “disastrous”, he writes, leading to an “intellectual vacuum” when the global financial crisis struck. Voters have been left to cope with the harsh effects of austerity while the financiers who created the crisis continue as before. The cold war years showed that managed capitalism did a better job of providing people with hope and the things they want: a job, a pension, a home and a future. In the cold war years the mainstream parties made sure to provide these things, but no longer. The result is that they are turning to populism.A late penalty by Cristiano Ronaldo for Real Madrid prevented a remarkable comeback by Juventus in their Champions League quarter-final, the Spanish giants going through 4-3 on aggregate over their old rivals after almost blowing a 3-0 lead from the first leg. An equally fierce rivalry has seen Sunderland decide to have no cash turnstiles for their remaining home fixtures in order to prevent Newcastle fans filling the Stadium of Light to gloat at the old enemy’s expected relegation to League One.

There’s no doubt about the main story today with most leading on the Syria crisis. The Telegraph has an extravagant display of Trump’s missile tweet and the splash headline “Trump warns missiles are coming”. The Times – “May prepares Britain to launch assault on Assad” – and the Mail – “May’s great gamble” – both focus on the domestic angle to the story. The Guardian reports that the Met has run out of leads in the Stephen Lawrence case, but its main story is also the Middle East under the headline “Trump warns Russia to get ready for US missile strike on Syria”. The Express reckons we’re “One tweet from war” while the Mirror thinks we’re “On Brink”.The FT goes with “Tesco seals comeback with profits topping £1bn”.For more news: www.theguardian.comThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Photograph: Fabrizio BenschReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will today unveil proposals for closer Irish-German ties when Germany’s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, visits Dublin.The plan is expected to involve a new consulate in Frankfurt, a joint Irish-German economic council, closer political and ministerial exchanges and a greater arts push co-ordinated by a new cultural director in Berlin.The Irish Embassy in Berlin has since December been consulting on proposals to boost Ireland’s profile in Germany ahead of Brexit and next year’s 90th anniversary of the first Irish diplomatic mission to the country. Germany is not just first among equals in the EU: it is Ireland’s second-largest source of inward investment, third-largest source of foreign guests, fourth-largest trading partner and fifth largest food export market.Bedded down in the Government’s wider plan to double Ireland’s global footprint by 2025, proposals raised during German consultations include an award recognising people who contribute to Irish-German relations and greater outreach to emigrant Irish families and second- and third-generation Irish.The Department of Foreign Affairs plan is an attempt to adapt to new post-Brexit realities but also to catch up with Irish people voting with their feet. In the six years to 2016, the Irish community in Germany grew by 40 per cent to 14,000 and continues to expand.The plan is likely to make clear that a reboot of Irish relations must engage closely with Angela Merkel’s federal government but also with the decentralised Germany beyond Berlin: 16 federal states, many with populations and economies dwarfing most EU members, which have huge autonomy in everything from investment to education policy.It is expected to propose regular German visits by Irish officials to co-ordinate bilateral and EU policy.Closer ties will hinge on Irish officials identifying and implementing useful projects with Germany – from cybersecurity co-operation to arms control and development co-operation in Africa.A key factor in realising the policy review is funding. An embassy survey flagged culture as the single most visible platform for Ireland in Germany. Yet, even as Ireland’s economy recovers, its annual cultural spend in Germany is a quarter that of Denmark and a fifth of Finland’s, two similarly sized countries.While those countries have dedicated cultural spaces, the report is likely to recommend rebranding the existing Embassy space as an “Ireland House” for cultural events.Frankfurt has emerged as the likely home of a new permanent consulate, given it is home to the European Central Bank, major European banks, the IDA and Tourism Ireland.The plan also underlines how selling Ireland, its products and services to Germany cannot happen unless those doing so speak German. With that in mind, the plan identifies a need for a new German language-learning push in Ireland and renewal of German-Irish education links.German officials have welcomed Ireland’s strategic review as timely. Mr Maas will use his first visit to Dublin – before heading on to London – to underline Berlin’s backing for Ireland’s Brexit position.Berlin officials see the Republic as a litmus test for Brexit: if it can be made work with minimum disruption on the island, it will work for the EU27.While Mr Maas is in Dublin, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will hold his first meeting in Berlin with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz. As well as discussing post-Brexit EU budget planning, Mr Donohoe will sound out the Social Democrat minister on whether to expect continuity or change from Berlin on the EU tax debate which, in Germany, has focused on Ireland.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458482.1523467615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit is no excuse to start misunderstanding the eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit: the UK’s departure has led to a renewed spirit of togetherness among the remaining EU members. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGettyThere’s an inescapable link between the discussion of Brexit and that of the future ethos and shape of the EU of 27. But does that necessary link make it an opportunity to be embraced? Should we be seizing the moment to refashion and redesign the architecture of the European Union?We’ve got to change the treaties, if only to take the United Kingdom references out. So why not a full reworking, to recognise and institutionalise the “reality” that the UK has articulated, the need for a different kind of union, a vision shared by others? How about two unions in one? Concentric circles, with the most committed integrationists in the middle, and others, like the UK, in an outer association of those interested only in economic ties?Or so argues Federico Fabbrini, professor of European law and head of Dublin City University’s Brexit institute.But mention treaty changes – even the word referendum – to Irish officials or politicians and you see them age. Treaty changes necessitated by the specific requirements of Brexit are one thing an opening of the whole can of worms entirely another.Fabbrini was in Brussels on Monday to host, with the Irish representation to the EU, a well-attended Brexit seminar that heard assessments of the state of play in negotiations from commissioner Phil Hogan, a member of the EU task force, and a senior Irish diplomat.Fabbrini’s lively contribution rehearsed an argument he has made in several articles. It’s not Euroscepticism but a “realist” Europhile’s concern that the European integration project may be stalled irrevocably. And primarily by failing to address profound differences about the finalité, or end state, of union integration. Unanimity means the slowest mover can determine the pace of advance.But giving credence to the British line that “we never joined up to political union, only a common market”, and the suggestion other states share that analysis, provoked several members of the audience to demur forcibly.For one thing the distinction between “economic” and “political” union is somewhat artificial, and, as Fabbrini admits, the British position is a “misunderstanding” – some would say a deliberate obfuscation – of the reality that the EEC was founded as an explicitly political project. Economic integration was the means to an end indeed, as one member of the audience pointed out, but for a parliamentary mix-up in France the EEC was almost founded as a defence union.Fabbrini is right to say that the new model of “future relationship” being negotiated between the EU and UK, a trading partnership with much access to the single market and EU programmes, could become a template for other “association” relationships with “third countries” – although there are already good templates in the arrangements that countries like Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and Turkey have with the EU.But the idea that such a formalised framework of concentric circles could also accommodate some of the “difficult” member states as second-class members is far more problematic.In recent years the EU has embraced a new form of integration , “differentiated integration”, in which it tries to accommodate those who want to move forward more quickly and those reluctant to do so – but without creating a hierarchy of members, or unpicking the basic institutional structure of the EU, a bargain in which all member states preserve equality in ultimate decision-making.“Europe has developed in variable geometry,” Fabbrini points out in a recent paper. “Two countries (the UK and Denmark) have a derogation from adopting the common currency two countries (the UK and Ireland) have an opt-out from Schengen and three countries (the UK, Poland and the Czech Republic) have obtained a protocol that seeks to exempt them from the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.“Moreover, 25 member states have embarked in the process of enhanced co-operation to set up a unitary patent court, and 10 euro-zone countries are discussing the introduction of a financial transaction tax.”And he could have mentioned the 25 member states that signed up in December to the military co-operation project Pesco.But preserving the essential equality of members, even if they are proceeding at different speeds, is vital. It is precisely the most “difficult” member states, like Poland and Hungary, so loath to share in common tasks like easing partners’ refugee burden, that are most resistant to any institutionalisation of a multiple-speed EU.They fear being treated as second-class members, and see in it an opportunity for the wealthier states to step back from their willingness to help poorer states catch up through cohesion and structural funding. “Solidarity, brothers,” they say, “is the backbone of the EU.” Although it may sound strange from those quarters.The UK’s declaration of intent to depart was seen by some as likely to herald a rush for the exit door. Instead, as many observers have noted, it led if anything to a renewed spirit of togetherness and determination not to see the project undermined by an always-reluctant member.Hard cases make bad law, and it would be mistaken to see Brexit as a rationale for institutionalising a profound “misunderstanding”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000159114527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british cheese now status symbol us japan","story":"British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroadBritish cheese exports are booming in a boost for the UK economy, thanks to a growing demand for smelly cheeseboards in US and Japan.British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas.

Operating profit increased by 80.6 per cent from £1.02bn to £1.84bn, while profit before tax was up 795 per cent at £1.3bn, from £145m. Group sales rose 2.3 per cent from £49.9bn to £51bn, as the supermarket added 260,000 more customers.  Tesco and Morrisons fastest growing big supermarkets, data showsThe company said it would pay a idend of 3p per share, the first idend it has announced since embarking on a strict cost-cutting strategy in the wake of an accounting scandal almost four years ago.  Shares in the group rose as much as 3.9 per cent in early trading, after the results were published on Wednesday. In September 2014, Tesco admitted to a £250m overstatement of profits for the first half of that year. The UK supermarket watchdog later found that the group had been deliberately and repeatedly withholding money owed to suppliers to boost its sales performance artificially.On Wednesday, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, who was parachuted into the top spot after the scandal in a bid to turn things around, said the business was making good progress.“We are generating significant levels of cash and net debt is down by almost £6bn over the last three years,” he said. “All of this puts us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions, and create long-term value for every stakeholder in Tesco.”The company said it is set to meet its target, outlined in October 2016, of reducing costs by £1.5bn and improving operating margins to between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent, by the 201920 financial year. Tesco also said the integration of wholesaler Booker, which it bought last year, is “well underway” and is expected to generate a “synergy benefit” of £60m within the first year.Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets, said investors were pleased with the supermarket’s expectation-beating performance, and added: “The competition is still fierce as discounter outlets such as Aldi and Lidl are holding the strong position in the market, and this remains the nightmare for Tesco. However, the new CEO who took the helm back in 2014 has simplified the product line, and he is determined to cut the cost.”Meanwhile, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesco was enjoying a “renaissance”.  “Its turnaround plan is literally paying idends to shareholders,” he said. “The outlook is now looking more positive for the grocery sector after a pretty challenging year in 2017. The inflationary squeeze looks to be easing on consumer purses, as is the exchange rate pressure on the cost of stocking shelves.” Mr Khalaf added: “Competition in the grocery market is still fierce, with the discounters Aldi and Lidl piling on the pressure, alongside the likes of Morrison and Sainsbury. “Tesco has responded strategically to the tough trading environment by purchasing the wholesaler Booker, overcoming competition concerns and some shareholder grumbling to do so.  “Overall Dave Lewis will be pleased his strategy is starting to gain traction, with sales and margins heading in the right direction, and the Booker acquisition in the bag.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The allegations centre around online strategies for the manipulation of voters deployed in the US 2016 Presidential election and the UK’s European Union referendum. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has given evidence to parliament. Meanwhile, across the pond, Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify in front of the US Congress. The backlash has been brutal with the #DeleteFacebook movement taking off. Markets have responded accordingly with Facebook’s share value plummeting.Writing in The Observer last year, Carole Cadwalladr posited that Britain (and one may as well add the US) are increasingly looking like “a ‘managed’ democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.”However, the real story is much bigger than the fallout from the Trump election and the Brexit vote. It is a story that extends beyond a limited set of players in Silicon Valley and the billionaire super class. It encompasses governments, the military and intelligence agencies intent on exploiting the internet and social media for surveillance, control and manipulation of citizens and societies. Facebook removes hundreds of pages controlled by Russian organisationThe concept of managed democracy stretches back a hundred years. After the introduction of universal suffrage, the establishment was concerned about the outcome of elections. During the 1920s Edward Bernays was one of the pivotal figures who helped to develop the concept of managed democracy. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the father of modern-day public relations. He understood that advertising could subliminally tap into the unconscious of repressed animal instincts, such as sexual desire. Bernays’ clients included some of the largest US corporations. Bernays transplanted the same techniques into politics as outlined in Adam Curtis’s 2002 BBC documentary The Century of the Self. This could be achieved through propaganda in various guises, such as the use of mass media in order to manipulate populations. The US military and CIA deployed psychological operations (mass propaganda induced through emotions) across the world in various theatres ranging from the wars in Korea and Vietnam to Central America during the Cold War. The only difference today is that the internet has become the new playground for 21st century psychological operations. How Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlHow Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlDonald Trump, Mike Pence and technology company chiefs at a meeting at Trump Tower in New York, 2016Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to testify before the US Congress following pressure from politiciansThe 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease around technologyGoogle’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in IraqChristopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica and now a whistleblower who exposed how the data firm harvested data from millions of Facebook usersAccording to The Observer, billionaire Robert Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10 million stake in the company Cambridge Analytica.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, prior to the US 2016 election, online automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Whisteblower Edward Snowden\u0027s files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook.Silicon Valley – from heroes to villainsFor a long time, Silicon Valley presented itself as the shiny, happy face of capitalism. It sold the promise of new technology that could connect the global village. Facebook’s mission statement was, “Making the world more open and connected”. The internet even held out the utopian possibility of liberating societies. Networks amplified political activism and bypassed the monopoly of the corporate media. The internet provided a cloak of anonymity for whistleblowers fighting state andor corporate power. Wikileaks and Julian Assange would even attempt to take credit for catalysing the Arab Spring through the Cablegate leaks revealing the corruption and vulgar excesses of tinpot dictators. Yet as with all technology, it has proved to be a double-edged sword. Disturbing revelations have exposed a darker side of exploitative, highly secretive and even sinister practices. Public sentiment has turned from infatuation to outrage. The 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease.The marriage of big data and neoliberalism enabled the metrics of the market to be extended to every sphere in society. A Black Mirror episode “Nosee” imagined the dystopian vision in which this process is taken to its logical conclusion. Every emotional experience, lived moment and interaction is exploited, mined, recorded and measured with constant recalibration interfacing with one’s personal score and therefore social status. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is one of those credited with creating the profession of public relations (Getty)From here it is a short step to Foucault’s concept of the panopticon in which each person is scrutinising and scrutinised by everyone else. The mass collection and retention of data became linked in with surveillance – big brother meets big data. Simultaneously, big tech managed to carve out a libertarian philosophy while being integrated with the national security state. In fact, Silicon Valley has increasingly become part of the military-industrial complex selling its technologies to US military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Google, for example, has a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) allowing the agency to use Google Earth Builder. Google’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in Iraq, while Google and the NGA purchased GeoEye-1, which is the world’s highest-resolution satellite. Lacie, the protagonist in the ‘Black Mirror’ episode ‘Nosee’, rating her social interactions on her phone (Getty)In fact, Google has a revolving door with the national security state employing managers with backgrounds in military and intelligence work and it partners with defence contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman focusing on drones and robotics. Similarly, Amazon has developed a $600m (£426m) cloud computing system for the CIA that also services all 17 US intelligence agencies. Data-mining tech company Palantir was co-founded by Trump donor and backer Peter Thiel. Palantir’s advisers include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. Its customers include the NSA, FBI and CIA due to the fact that it is a leader in the field of mining massive data sets. It has been deployed by the Marines in Afghanistan and in the Mexican drug war. Its commercial clients include Bank of America, JPMorgan, News Corp and pharmaceutical firms. Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley tech billionaire, who also co-founded PayPal as a system of electronic payment. He went on to give Mark Zuckerberg the first outside investment in Facebook consisting of a half-million-dollar loan later converted into a 7 per cent ownership stake and a seat on the board. Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital Management had assets of more than $7bn before the financial crisis. His venture-capital firm Founders Fund has an online manifesto that begins, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” – summing up his pessimistic stance on the demise of technological utopianism.Thiel has cultivated a libertarian persona outlined in a 2009 essay titled The Education of a Libertarian. This fleshes out the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy since the 1920s. He argues that capitalism is “not popular with the crowd”. Thiel disparages the “unthinking demos”, which has made greater demands for social democratic concessions thus constraining capitalism. Thiel is apparently obsessed with economic stagnation diagnosing that, “without a new technology revolution, globalisation’s discontents would lead to increased conflict and, perhaps, a worldwide conflagration”. He is contemptuous of the failure of imagination of disconnected elites with the danger being that people will turn against capitalism. This is supported by a 2016 Harvard study, which found that a majority of American millennials reject capitalism with a third supporting socialism. It is also in keeping with the demographic shifts driving the Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn phenomena, in turn fuelled by intergenerational injustice. Is Trump right to say Amazon is costing the US Post Office billions?Trump’s biggest campaign donor was Robert Mercer – a reclusive American hedge-fund billionaire and computer scientist. Mercer began his career at IBM working on breakthroughs in language processing integral to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). He went on to become joint CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which applies algorithms to model and trade on financial markets. One of its funds – Medallion – is reportedly the most successful in the world. All of which has enabled Mercer to coordinate with the Koch brothers donating tens of millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns and ultra-conservative organisations. As The New Yorker investigative journalist Jane Mayer relates, both Mercer and oil tycoon William Lee Hanley had commissioned polling from Patrick Caddell ahead of the 2016 election, which showed “mounting anger towards wealthy elites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class.” The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”.Caddell and partners later went public with the Candidate Smith project based on the idea that the public wanted an outsider Mr. Smith Goes to Washington figure as president. Worryingly, the data also revealed that the public was yearning for a strong man to fix the country. Thiel (pictured with Donald Trump in 2016) is contemptuous of disconnected elites who he believes are turning people against capitalismAccording to The Observer, Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10m stake in the company Cambridge Analytica. It managed to build a 230-million-strong US voter database collecting up to 5,000 pieces of demographic, psychological, consumer and lifestyle information about each inidual with Facebook proving vital to this data profiling. The company is focused on the manipulation of psychographics – the study of personality traits – although its officials claim that this was not deployed in the 2016 US election. The power of the computer algorithms in question is such that 150 Facebook likes can be modelled to predict a person’s behaviour better than a family member. Three-hundred likes effectively means that the algorithm knows you better than a spouse. The effectiveness of this manipulation remains disputed although the power to micro-target iniduals and to induce mass effects at a population level points to sinister implications. Some authorities, such as Emma Briant (author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change), have stated that Cambridge Analytica has the technological capability to effect behavioural and psychological change.Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told a conference in New York his company was able to predict the personality of every adult in the US (Getty)Cambridge Analytica’s parent company is British corporation SCL Group – formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories. SCL Group works on psychological operations and foreign propaganda campaigns. It collects large amounts of data about an audience in order to identify “persuadables” and target them with tailored messages.  Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, declared at a 2016 conference in New York that, “by having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America”. SCL has worked in more than 60 countries including Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Pakistan. It “offers military clients techniques in ‘soft power’”, specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”. It has worked for Nato, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US State Department amongst others in “changing the behaviour of large groups”. In 2012, Facebook conducted studies involving secretive psychological testing of approximately 700,000 of its users. This was through reducing exposure to positive or negative emotional content in order to measure the effects. The study concluded: “Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks.” This study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while another Facebook project looked at how users consumed information on Twitter.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, one-third of all traffic on Twitter prior to the EU referendum was generated by automated “bots”, which were all pro-Leave and prior to the US 2016 election, the same automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Similarly, there were hundreds of automated websites pumping out pro-Trump messages crafting a mass consensus or political climate. Reportedly, there are thousands of dormant “sleeper” bots presumably waiting to be activated during a future crisis. The war on terror has enabled the state to amass authoritarian control over iniduals. The Washington Post’s 2010 Top Secret America investigation painted a terrifying vision of the US morphing into an Orwellian big brother state.Militarisation of homeland security is now extensive. General Atomics’ Predator drones monitor the Mexican and Canadian borders through real-time, full-motion video cameras. The Department of Homeland Security collects pictures, videos and other data on American citizens. It even helped Memphis police set up a crime-analysis fusion centre fitted with walls of streaming surveillance video capable of matching army command controls, while Maryland Police have infiltrated and labelled political activist groups dedicated to human rights, anti-war and bike lanes as terrorists.This conflation of the war on terror with political activism means that the definition of terrorism is widened to include any enemy of the state andor corporate interests. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange can thus be viewed as political prisoners or exiles. The US Department of Defence has been funding research into the use of the internet for 21st century psychological operations. The Pentagon’s military research arm – the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) – has been conducting experiments on the internet in order to study social connections, propagation of messages and influence behaviour. In fact, Darpa invented the precursor of the internet – Arpanet, Darpa’s social media in strategic communication (SMISC) programme is developing algorithms for the “formation, development and spread of ideas and concepts (memes)” on social media. SMISC is channelling millions in funding for projects to corporations and academic hubs. This has included studies analysing how Occupy activists used Twitter, Twitter users’ opinions on fracking and interactions of Twitter users in the Middle East. Recent revelations suggest that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users (Getty)The journalist Glenn Greenwald has revealed that both the NSA (National Security Agency) and its UK sister GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) have been working on exploiting social media. According to the Snowden files, this entails “propaganda”, “deception”, “mass messaging” and “pushing stories”. While GCHQ described its intentions to seed “state propaganda” across the internet. GCHQ’s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is focused on “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world” including “information ops (influence or disruption)”.US defence corporation General Dynamics is also involved in information operations. This includes contracts with the Special Operations Command’s psychological operations unit to design websites in order to persuade foreigners to align views with US interests.In-Q-Tel – the CIA’s venture capital firm – has been investing in companies engaged in social media mining and surveillance. Dataminr streams data from Twitter to spot trends for law enforcement agencies and hedge funds. Geofeedia collects social media messages in order to track activists for police departments and corporations. Pathar is used by the FBI to mine social media in order to determine networks and signs of radicalisation. Netbase is capable of scanning billions of sources online and Recorded Future monitors the worldwide web to predict future events. Bruce Lund wrote in a 2012 paper that “monitoring social media” is increasingly essential for government tracking of “erupting political movements, crises, epidemics, and disasters, not to mention general global trends”. Such strategies can be exploited for counterterrorism but are also being turned against citizens by law enforcement and against activist groups by the private sector. Palantir was thus exposed in negotiations to track trade union activists and other critics of the US Chamber of Commerce. Various police departments and corporations such as McDonald’s have contracted with Geofeedia, which markets its research into student demonstrations, Greenpeace and other political movements. In 2008, an Obama adviser, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote a controversial paper advocating the use of covert agents in order to cognitively infiltrate online groups, sites and activists. The Snowden files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook, attempt to “control, infiltrate, manipulate and warp online discourse” and remarkably even carry out “false flag operations” in order to discredit targets.In a wide-ranging New Yorker profile, Peter Thiel told author George Packer that the failures of the establishment have rekindled his optimism pointing the way either towards libertarianism or, conversely, Marxism, although he was forced to concede that unfettered capitalism is not acceptable to ordinary Americans.Peter has cultivated a libertarian persona – a 2009 essay fleshes out what he regard as the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy (Alamy)His thinking essentially represents the extreme manifestation of a growing consensus amongst elites that the status quo is unsustainable. This could lead potentially to instability, systemic collapse and civilizational crisis. In turn, this could pave the way either towards progressive, radical post-capitalist transformation that would necessarily damage vested interests – or conversely an authoritarian order designed to cement those interests. In fact, the status quo is liable to exacerbate inequality, poverty, climate change and social isions ensuring that authoritarian measures are necessary in the face of increasing rioting, disruption and social unrest. Indeed, economist and writer Joseph Stiglitz, who was previously chief economist at the World Bank, has piquantly asked how long it will be before the scenes witnessed during the Arab Spring will be replicated on the streets of America. As Thiel has put it: “The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of iniduals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” It appears that Thiel conceives of himself as this John Galt-type heroic figure lifted straight out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The battleground of politics has expanded to include the virtual world of the internet. This is in keeping with media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s prediction that World War Three would be a guerrilla information war with no distinction between military and civilian participation. Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many messaging platforms are encrypted in order to guard user privacy. It\u0027s hard to guarantee that a given classical source is really unpredictable, said Dr Peter Bierhorst, one of the National Institute of Standards and Technology mathematicians behind the work. Largest known prime number discovered with over 23 million digitsOur quantum source and protocol is like a fail-safe. We\u0027re sure that no one can predict our numbers.Conventional random numbers are generated using software and devices that come with inevitable flaws meaning their output cannot be truly unpredictable.Machines generating “unpredictable” numbers will do so using an algorithm. While this method can be sufficiently random so as to give the impression of randomness, ultimately it will always be governed by carefully defined and consistent algorithms that could be predicted.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.The everyday examples of flipping a coin or rolling a dice are useful analogies. While both appear to be random, these too could be predicted if enough information were available.Something like a coin flip may seem random, but its outcome could be predicted if one could see the exact path of the coin as it tumbles, said Dr Bierhorst. “Quantum randomness, on the other hand, is real randomness.” Quantum mechanics is better at generating randomness as measurements of quantum particles in a superposition have results that are fundamentally unpredictable.The scientists used photons – or light particles – from a laser to generate their random numbers in a process known as a “Bell test”.If you can solve one of these 6 major math problems, you\u0027ll win $1mThis method uses an intense laser fired at a special crystal that converts light into pairs of entangled photons – a quantum phenomenon. Measuring these photons provided the researchers with their numbers.The scientists trialled their Bell test over 55 million times, each time producing  two digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons.For the first time, Dr Bierhorst and his colleagues were able to close any “loopholes” that would allow seemingly non-random numbers to seem random. The results of this work were published in the journal Nature.“We\u0027re very sure we\u0027re seeing quantum randomness because only a quantum system could produce these statistical correlations between our measurement choices and outcomes,” said Dr Bierhorst.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Operating profit increased by 80.6 per cent from £1.02bn to £1.84bn, while profit before tax was up 795 per cent at £1.3bn, from £145m. Group sales rose 2.3 per cent from £49.9bn to £51bn, as the supermarket added 260,000 more customers.  Tesco and Morrisons fastest growing big supermarkets, data showsThe company said it would pay a idend of 3p per share, the first idend it has announced since embarking on a strict cost-cutting strategy in the wake of an accounting scandal almost four years ago.  Shares in the group rose as much as 3.9 per cent in early trading, after the results were published on Wednesday. In September 2014, Tesco admitted to a £250m overstatement of profits for the first half of that year. The UK supermarket watchdog later found that the group had been deliberately and repeatedly withholding money owed to suppliers to boost its sales performance artificially.On Wednesday, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, who was parachuted into the top spot after the scandal in a bid to turn things around, said the business was making good progress.“We are generating significant levels of cash and net debt is down by almost £6bn over the last three years,” he said. “All of this puts us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions, and create long-term value for every stakeholder in Tesco.”The company said it is set to meet its target, outlined in October 2016, of reducing costs by £1.5bn and improving operating margins to between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent, by the 201920 financial year. Tesco also said the integration of wholesaler Booker, which it bought last year, is “well underway” and is expected to generate a “synergy benefit” of £60m within the first year.Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets, said investors were pleased with the supermarket’s expectation-beating performance, and added: “The competition is still fierce as discounter outlets such as Aldi and Lidl are holding the strong position in the market, and this remains the nightmare for Tesco. However, the new CEO who took the helm back in 2014 has simplified the product line, and he is determined to cut the cost.”Meanwhile, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesco was enjoying a “renaissance”.  “Its turnaround plan is literally paying idends to shareholders,” he said. “The outlook is now looking more positive for the grocery sector after a pretty challenging year in 2017. The inflationary squeeze looks to be easing on consumer purses, as is the exchange rate pressure on the cost of stocking shelves.” Mr Khalaf added: “Competition in the grocery market is still fierce, with the discounters Aldi and Lidl piling on the pressure, alongside the likes of Morrison and Sainsbury. “Tesco has responded strategically to the tough trading environment by purchasing the wholesaler Booker, overcoming competition concerns and some shareholder grumbling to do so.  “Overall Dave Lewis will be pleased his strategy is starting to gain traction, with sales and margins heading in the right direction, and the Booker acquisition in the bag.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An estimated 4.1 million customers will see their bills increase by an average of £60 per year.The price hike was immediately criticised by MPs across the political spectrum. The Government said it was “disappointed” with the “unjustified” decision, while Labour accused ministers of failing to introduce the price cap quickly enough.Centrica, which owns British Gas, blamed the increase on rising wholesale energy prices and said government policies were also responsible.In response, Claire Perry, the minister for energy and clean growth, said: “We are disappointed by British Gas’s announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to.“This is why government is introducing a new price cap by this winter to guarantee that consumers are protected from poor value tariffs and further bring down the £1.4bn a year consumers have been overpaying the Big Six.

She is the first female Black Rod in the 650-year history of the role and will be known as the Lady Usher of the Black Rod.“While we are in favour of free markets, we will always take action to fix them when they are broken”, she said. “We will always take on monopolies and vested interests when they are holding people back.“The energy market punishes loyalty with higher prices and the most loyal customers are often those with lower incomes, the elderly, people with lower qualifications and people who rent their homes.”The legislation introducing the cap is still working its way through parliament.Labour accused ministers of having “done nothing” to stop energy companies hiking prices before the cap comes into effect.Alan Whitehead, the shadow business minister, said: “This price hike is yet another example of the Tories failing consumers and not addressing the broken energy market. British Gas is rushing out an increase before the price cap comes in and the government has done nothing to stop this happening.“That is why Labour would do much more, introducing an immediate cap on bills so that there is no return to the kind of behaviour we are seeing here, and bringing key parts of our energy system back into public ownership to deliver energy that is fairer and more accountable.”Energy price cap triggers mixed reactions from consumer groupsGovernment introduces legislation capping energy prices to parliament\u0027Energy price cap needed to protect customers from \u0027rip-off\u0027 tariffs\u0027UK energy price cap could come into effect by Christmas 2018Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett, called the rise “a slap in the face” for the 4,000 households in his constituency that live in fuel poverty “and for those who struggle with extortionate energy bills”.There are over 4000 households in fuel poverty in my constituency. This is a slap in the face for all of them, and for those who struggle with extortionate energy bills. Yet another example of a Conservative Government for the few and not the many https:t.co1qzerJUQg8Defending the price increase, Mark Hodges, chief executive of Centrica Consumer, said: “We fully understand that any price increase adds extra pressure on customers\u0027 household bills. This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control.“We continue to work hard to reduce our own costs and keep our prices as low as possible. We have seen other suppliers raise prices and Ofgem increase the level of the prepayment tariff cap largely due to increasing wholesale energy and government policy costs.“He added: “Government policies, intended to transform the energy system, are important but they are putting pressure on customers\u0027 bills.“We believe the government should level the playing field so the customers of all suppliers pay a fair share of energy policy costs. We continue to encourage government to consider moving these costs out of energy bills altogether and into general taxation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities.“Labour wants to help young people make the most out of life by investing in them, which is why today we are pledging the next Labour government will provide the funds to cover free bus travel for under-25s, to support them to travel to work, to study and to visit friends.He will add: “Our policy provides help where it is most needed. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working age households without children.“Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel. Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

She is the first female Black Rod in the 650-year history of the role and will be known as the Lady Usher of the Black Rod.The pledge is estimated to cost £1.4bn a year, although the Conservatives claimed Labour’s own sums reveal the true cost could be up to £13bn a year.It would be funded by using around a fifth of the revenue generated by Vehicle Excise Duty, which is forecast to be £6.7 billion per year by 2022.The money is currently due to be spent on building new roads, but Labour said it would instead earmark a chunk for its bus fares policy and fund road building through increased government borrowing.It claimed the plans would encourage young people to use public transport instead of driving, thereby reducing congestion and pollution. The party hopes the policy will encourage people to get into the habit of using cars only when necessary.Speaking alongside Mr Corbyn, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, will say: “Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long, private bus companies have run our services for profit not people.How UK rail fares have risen against the cost of living since 1995“The public purse already pays 42 per cent of the costs of providing local bus services, but deregulated private companies choose to run only the profitable services and leave councils to plug the gaps left for non-profitable but vital routes.“That’s why we’ll encourage local authorities to take back control of their buses so they can provide a better and more sustainable service to young and old alike, wherever they live.”The announcement follows a worrying fall in the number of people using buses, which is now at its lowest level in ten years.In London, the reduction has prompted fears among Transport for London (TfL) executives over the state of the organisation’s finances.This, coupled with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s decision to freeze some fares, means TfL is facing a deficit of almost £1bn next year.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Eight of the UK\u0027s 10 best-selling albums of 2017 were by homegrown talent, with Drake and Pink being the only outside entries. Sheeran\u0027s third album Divide was the most popular record across all formats last year and broke several industry records.Best albums of 2017Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards, said: The changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit with rapid revenue growth in 2017.We are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness among consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of subscriptions, such as the launch of YouTube\u0027s premium music service and the growing popularity of smart speakers in the home.\u0027How did we do all that?\u0027: Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart on EurythmicsFollowing predictions that streaming would overtake physical sales in the UK last year, Taylor said that while the British music sector was in rude health, the government should prioritise creative industries in a post-Brexit world. It means making sure that UK artists can tour freely in EU markets and that UK businesses can access the best talent. It means taking firm action against illegal websites that deny artists a living, and it means making clear in UK law that huge online platforms must pay fair royalties for the music they use.If we do this, the future for British music, which is already one of our leading exports, will be very bright, he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And authorities there say they are now considering the feasibility of developing an entire district of such homes.Architects propose 3D-printed pods to shelter NYC\u0027s homeless“Is this the future?” asked Benoit Furet, a University of Nantes professor who worked on the year-long project.“It\u0027s a solution and a constructive principle that is interesting because we create the house directly on site and, in addition, we are able to create walls with complex shapes.”While this is not the first building to have been created using printing technology, those behind the scheme - including academics, engineers and manufacturers  - say it will be the first to be permanently habituated.
