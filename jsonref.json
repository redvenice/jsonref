staggeringly high losses for any Catholic families at the time.For 300 years, the Bedingfeld family were subjected to heavy taxation, exclusion from public office and education, costing them both politically and financially.The National Trust believes the new discoveries may have been concealed from Elizabeth I\u0027s agents, such as spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham.Other findings were also estimated to have been dated later, with a chocolate box dating to the 1940s having also been uncovered amongst the thousands of objects at the National Trust property. Some of the findings will shortly go on display at Oxburgh Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"Belaruss opposition leader taking dictator Europe","story":"Share this article   Tikhanovskaya has accused Lukashenko of showing blatant disregard for the people during the coronavirus epidemic, which the president has dismissed as a hoax. The Village, a Minsk-based news site, called her \u0027an accidental Joan of Arc,\u0027 invoking the French peasant who helped achieve a pivotal military victory against the English in the 15th century. Tikhanovskaya has also been helped by two women with more political experience: Veronika Tsepkalo, whose ex-diplomat husband Valery Tsepkalo was barred from standing, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign chief of ex-banker Viktor Babaryko who was also dropped from the polls and is in jail.The two women have flanked Tikhanovskaya at campaign rallies, earning them the nickname of \u0027Charlie\u0027s Angels.\u0027Tikhanovskaya has started wearing her hair down and swapped severe dark clothing for pastels colours. The women wear t-shirts with a design featuring their signature gestures: Tikhanovskaya\u0027s punched fist, Kolesnikova\u0027s fingers in a heart shape and Tsepkalo\u0027s victory sign. After Lukashenko claimed a disputed victory last week, Tikhanovskaya indicated she had left Belarus to be with her children.  \u0027Children are the most important thing we have in life,\u0027 said the 37-year-old after leaving for Lithuania. However, she has continued to rally her supporters and said today she was willing to assume the presidency if Lukashenko was forced out.    \u0027I did not want to be a politician,\u0027 she said. \u0027But fate decreed that I\u0027d find myself on the frontline of a confrontation against arbitrary rule and injustice.\u0027  Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: from \u0027Chernobyl child\u0027 in Ireland to political limelight | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Chronic stress caused Covid 19 pandemic lead generation babies born smaller","story":"Share this articleThey found that \u0027all types of direct exposure at the site and PTSD were associated independently with low birth weight\u0027 in births two years after the event. Professor Bogin and Dr Varea concluded the \u0027fundamental message from this review is maternal stress lowers birth weight\u0027. One of the studies analysed was their own, which identified a similar trend during the 2008 to 2014 financial crisis in Spain. The number of small babies born to first-time mothers increased from 5.12 per cent in 1996 to 6.87 per cent in 2008. And among women who were already mothers, the prevalence of low-birth-weight babies increased from 3.96 per cent to 5.2 per cent. Professor Bogin said: \u0027We reported a decline in birth weight across virtually all maternal social-economic groups in Spain in the years leading up to, and especially, during the financial crisis.\u0027Our findings are supported by studies reporting reduced birth weight in Portugal, Iceland, Japan, and Greece during the 2008 banking system crisis, which was a global financial pandemic.\u0027Professor Bogin and Dr Varea explain in their commentary how chronic stress can cause biological changes in the body, altering hormone levels and cell behaviour. Maternal stress and its impact on the baby may also be due to indirect actions such as a poor diet, addictive behaviour such as smoking and failing to go to antenatal appointments. The experts defined \u0027chronic stress\u0027 as insecurity related to money, housing, social support. It includes worry about job loss, loss of benefits, loss of a partner, or loss of housing.Talking about stress due to Covid-19, Professor Bogin and Dr Varea said: \u0027Fear of pandemic disease spreads as fast and as deep as the disease itself.\u0027The fear plays‐out in in many ways, from extremes of paranoia and violence, to xenophobia, closed borders, economic lockdowns, and social distancing.\u0027The fear pervades every level of society. The fear causes emotional stress. Chronic emotional stress—from insecurity that lasts for months or years—has biological impacts on people.\u0027The researchers noted recent events prove the pandemic is causing emotionally-driven behaviour.For example: \u0027During the first week of April, 5G cellular communication towers in Birmingham, Liverpool and Melling, UK were burned by people claiming that 5G technology is the cause of Covid-19.\u0027They wrote: \u0027Pregnant women, their foetuses, and young people of all ages will suffer if exposed to chronic, toxic emotional stress.\u0027Chronic toxic stress takes a toll on human health, including the physical growth of people, as much as do food shortages and infection.\u0027The consequences of low birth weight include an increased risk of poor learning and school performance, psychological problems and reduced adult earnings.In relation to health, it could lead to infection, adult obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and, on average, an earlier age at death, the researchers noted.The paper will feature in a forthcoming special issue on the Covid-19 pandemic in the American Journal of Human Biology.      "},{"url":null,"title":"Major U turn levels GCSEs based teachers assessments","story":"Share this article   The Liberal Democrats have called for Mr Williamson to quit. \u0027The shambolic handling of A-level results has left many young people in crisis,\u0027 Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said. \u0027Despite the warning signs from Scotland, the Education Secretary pushed ahead with plans which ignored teachers\u0027 advice and have disproportionately affected pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.

But sneezes can give off up to 100,000 particles.The researchers estimated that a person standing two metres from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10,000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing half a metre away wearing a basic single layer mask.  When the mannequin wore any of the two face masks, less than one in 1,000 particles escaped into the environment. In contrast to the mannequin tests, there was a large variability in the number of droplets expelled by the people without a mask. \u0027However, for all subjects, we did not find a single droplet when a mask was worn,\u0027 the paper said.\u0027Between 10s and 1000s\u0027 of particles were measured for speaking and coughing without a mask, but zero particles were seen when using a surgical mask, the scientists claimed.  Professor Paul Digard, of the University of Edinburgh\u0027s Roslin Institute, said: \u0027The simple message from our research is that face masks work.\u0027Wearing a face covering will reduce the probability that someone unknowingly infected with the virus will pass it on.\u0027According to the scientists, their results contrast with previous research that suggested masks are less effective.However, those studies also measured smaller droplets — known as aerosols — which can remain airborne for hours and don\u0027t immediately fall.It is still unclear if aerosol transmission of Covid-19 is a main transmission route, and therefore a study for large droplets is useful. The team cautioned that if aerosol transmission is found to be significant, then it changes the results of their findings. Their results may overestimate the effectiveness of masks and coverings, which will not necessarily protect against aerosol transmission.  Nevertheless, for bigger droplets, masks are extremely effective in reducing spread to the immediate surroundings, researchers said.  The researchers added their findings, which are presented in a preprint paper and not in a medical journal, could have implications for social distancing measures.Face Coverings and Respiratory Tract Droplet Dispersion | medRxiv"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b6b6880cc7974df5822df7559fa021bffce20/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec23219e5295951bc102e3c3158f4c7","title":"the big picture shadow play in 1930s germany","story":"Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their ownIn 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine Die Dame. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

Bolloré will take over next month from Sir Ralf Speth, who has run the carmaker for a decade.

I am not just talking about A-level results nor were the kids who were shouting: “Fuck the algorithm!” on the streets. This entirely predictable, man-made fiasco was not an accident.It was a combination of negligence and malice. Although the algorithm has now been ditched in favour of teacher assessments and the mess left for universities to clear up, it will be chaos. This is not just about the phenomenal uselessness of particular ministers, but a mindset in which children somehow are always someone else’s problem.This has been apparent from the onset of Covid. Schools were closed. The children of key workers could attend whatever the risk everyone else had to muddle along. “Work at home and homeschool your children,” was the advice. This job inevitably fell to women as, let’s face it, women just sort of do this stuff. It’s in our genes, apparently, like making packed lunches and remembering people’s birthdays. Women will pick up the pieces. The pieces that are actual people – kids who have been stressed, over-tested and told they must work extra hard, then had their exams whisked away.A generation that has been constantly scolded for spending too much time on screens and ruining its own social development is told … guess what. Spend more time on screens. That is where you will get your education now, even if you do get into the university of your dreams.The world became distant and online. During lockdown so many kids withdrew completely, many parents worried if their kids would ever get back out there again. Some worked diligently and some did sod all and thought that come exam time they would smash it. A Boris Johnson strategy, no less.In the early days of lockdown, I felt that not only had children been downgraded but also teachers. The long, slow undermining of the teaching profession – remember when Dominic Cummings was propelling Michael Gove as the education secretary to take on “the blob”? – continued. Austerity forced teachers to become social workers, handing out breakfasts to kids arriving hungry at school. Covid then reduced them from gifted, hard-working professionals running complex institutions to, basically, childminders. I say that with nothing but love for childminders and nursery workers, by the way I just note that such work is considered low-skilled and remains low-paid and is mostly done by women. Again, children are just something that women take care of.It is incomprehensible to me that this government somehow forgot the kids, not even in the David Cameron “left one down the pub way”, but in policy terms. It is almost as if none of them ever actually had responsibility for them.How did it come to this? Why do we despise young people, removing job, housing and educational opportunities and in the end a planet worth living on? As I said, it’s malice, a breaking of a fundamental social contract in which we do the best we can not just for our own children but for everyone’s.There was a peculiar sadism in saying to a child from a low-achieving school: “You will be judged by the record of those who went before you.” It was cruel to say to teenagers who have had none of the rites of passage of leaving school, and have been isolated and anxious, that they must suffer for fear of “grade inflation”. Would it have really mattered in the long run if an entire year got three A*s? Post-Covid adjustments could have been made. How was none of this thought about?Education has been in trouble for a long time. Creativity has been slowly erased from the curriculum in a dumb attempt to make us compete with South Korea. Let’s just say South Korea won.Education is about more than just grades, but this week it has been about grades – and the trampling of dreams. The PM had an urgent glamping trip. Priorities?The contempt with which these kids have been treated is something that even your basic Tory can see. What has been created for young people amounts to a hostile environment. As unemployment rises, jobs, particularly in retail and hospitality, have evaporated. Some of these teenagers are wise beyond their years, shouldering their disappointment with huge maturity. This was a call to arms.The right has always despised the “All must have prizes” aspect of child-centred education and this was the apotheosis of that attitude. All those who can be punished will be.This was not an algorithmic fluke – it was deliberate. The pandemic has shown us who is expendable: old people in care homes, nurses, migrant workers, working mothers and now children.Someone will now have to pick up the pieces, sure. Many kids will still miss out on places. It’s a huge mess even after the U-turn the work has simply been handed on to others, yet again. The grifters who think that their huge parliamentary majority means they can do whatever they like, with no consequences, will one day realise that the future will be not be U-turned. A generation has been taught a lesson that it won’t forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bbcb0265fd73737584f40b906bb5f175c4b347e/0_95_5240_3145/master/5240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eb15d23310d0de26950c3370e75d3dd","title":"the guardian view on belarus the perilous road to democracy","story":"The authority of president Alexander Lukashenko is draining away. Belarusian civil society must be allowed to control the future course of eventsOne of the great lessons of the revolutions of 1989 was that regimes built on lies are astonishingly fragile. In the German Democratic Republic, presided over with grim determination by Erich Honecker from 1971 until the fall of the Berlin Wall, there used to be an old joke: despite its name, the state was neither German, nor democratic, nor a republic. The humour expressed a popular awareness that East Germany was not just a bullying state. It was also, in a crucial way, a bogus one. When the opportunity to do something about that arrived, structures of power disintegrated overnight. Literally, in the case of the Wall.Three decades on, it seems that something similar is taking place in Belarus, the country that 1989 forgot. In the eight days since a rigged election awarded him a sixth term as president, authority has drained away from Alexander Lukashenko, the former collective farm director who has ruled since 1994. Suddenly, Mr Lukashenko’s traditional deployment of veiled threats and preposterous claims to mass consent has lost all power to intimidate and coerce.A nation energised by speaking truth to power is asserting itself. The brutal violence unleashed on protesters in the days after the election was answered at the weekend by huge columns of flower-waving women, all wearing the red and white colours of the opposition movement. On Monday, as Mr Lukashenko attempted to address factory workers in Minsk, most of his audience chanted: “Leave now!”. As calls for a general strike gathered momentum, morning newsreaders for Belarus’s state television company left their seats empty. The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia has taken the side of the protesters. Other members of Mr Lukashenko’s state apparatus will also be wondering how to place themselves on the right side of history.There is, however, no guarantee of a benign outcome to these extraordinary events. Mr Lukashenko’s menacing response to the factory workers was to say: “There won’t be any other elections until you kill me.” He also spent a good part of the weekend on the phone to Vladimir Putin, upon whom much now depends. Belarus is not Ukraine, and its citizens are largely pro-Russian. It is to be hoped that a humiliated strongman’s requests for eventual military assistance fall on deaf ears. Playing a role in a peaceful transition of power may suit Moscow’s interests better than acting as enforcer for an ally no longer fit for purpose.The west, and the European Union in particular, must play the crucial days and weeks to come very carefully indeed. Speaking from Lithuania yesterday, the opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, declared herself ready to lead Belarus through a transition period to a new election. EU leaders will meet in an emergency summit on Wednesday. They should calibrate their approach in consultation with Ms Tikhanovskaya and other opposition figures still in Minsk. The absolute priority should be to avoid the ramping up of EU-Russia tensions, and to give Belarusian civil society the best opportunity to control the course of future events.There is good reason to believe that this is the end of the line for Mr Lukashenko.

I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents, but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve.”The move had looked inevitable after Wales said it would revert to teacher assessments for A-levels, and Northern Ireland said it would do so for GCSEs, following a similar U-turn in Scotland last week.“The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver credible, strong results. It’s a robust system, it’s a fair system, it’s making sure that young people get the grades that they’ve worked so hard towards”“Most young people … will get the grade that the teacher sent in to the exam board that they thought they would get.”Q) “Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will not be forced into the embarrassing U-turn that John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon were in Scotland?”A) Absolutely“Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results that we’ve got today are robust. They’re good, they’re dependable for employers. It’s very important that for years to come people should be able to look at these grades and think these are robust, these are dependable”Hundreds of pupils took to the streets of London, demonstrating outside the Department for Education to express their anger, while others took to the airwaves and social media to describe their sense of devastation. Lawyers had began to consider taking action on behalf of affected teenagers.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed what he called the “screeching U-turn”, saying: “This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. However, the Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.“Incompetence has become this government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson’s failure to lead is holding Britain back.”Ministers had been under increasing pressure to act with GCSE results due to be published this Thursday for more than 600,000 year 11 pupils in England and 100,000 older students aiming for crucial passes in maths and English to qualify them for further training or study.The algorithm used by Ofqual for both A-levels and GCSEs was mainly based on a school’s past results and inidual pupil attainment. Teachers and schools were asked to submit grades, known as centre-assessed grades, but in the end these were influential in only a small number of cases.Ofqual argued that the algorithm was essential to ensure results were standardised across the country and in line with previous years, but hundreds of inidual stories documenting disappointment and an overwhelming sense of injustice among those affected proved too much to ignore.Ofqual confirmed its decision to award centre assessment grades (CAG) to A-level, AS-level and GCSE students, adding that where a moderated grade was higher than a CAG, students could keep that grade.Roger Taylor, Ofqual’s chair, acknowledged the standardised system had caused widespread anguish and damaged public confidence, and apologised to those affected.“We understand this has been a distressing time for students, who were awarded exam results last week for exams they never took. The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible, and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks,” he said.“After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS- and A-levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.“But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals, we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence. Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.“The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone else affected by this issue.”The Worth Less? campaign group, which represents hundreds of secondary school headteachers, welcomed the U-turn.“It’s a relief that this whole unedifying mess has some form of closure,” said Jules White, a secondary school headteacher and leader of Worth Less? “Students will get a much fairer deal and everyone can be pleased with that.“Major questions remain, though: why has it taken the DfE so long to resolve matters? Why have Ofqual and the DfE just spent time blaming each other rather than acting on behalf of children, their families and schools?“And crucially, how can we move confidently to wider school reopening when our political masters don’t understand how schools actually work?”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union, said: “The government has decided to rely on centre assessed grades for A level and GCSE results this year, agreeing that these are the most reliable measure of student performance.“School leaders and teachers worked with professionalism and integrity to submit these grades for all of their students. Having taken so long to make a decision, this was the only option that government had left to deal with the unfairness.“This decision will mean students expecting their GCSE results can have confidence that they will not experience the same unfairness or disadvantage as their older peers.“The big question remains as to why this decision has taken so long to come, as it may already be too late for some A level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. Every day of delay is going to have loaded more and more difficulty onto universities and their capacity to meet all of the demand for places that will now inevitably come their way. For them, the problem is far from over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a761286675bae3380edbcbb6e504b24052d6d007/0_254_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=413d971ccdbf757e295f7b0135529aaf","title":"a rollercoaster of emotions students describe sharp end of exams fiasco","story":"Dylan Irish and Leah Glenday both had their plans for university upended by the grading algorithmIrish, 18, is from Tottenham, north London. He attended Barnet and Southgate college, and had his assessed grades of A*AA reduced to BCC, meaning he was unable go to Warwick, his firm choice of university. Following the government’s U-turn, however, he is elated to be going there to study law.“I’m just feeling very grateful they’ve done the U-turn because I’ve worked so hard for two years, studying all the time, and the algorithm completely messed up my grades. I felt like that two years of hard work had gone down the drain because an algorithm disadvantaged me and pulled all my grades down … I felt disheartened, confused and upset, so I’m so happy change came. It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions. My friends are so happy as well, they got the grades they needed too.“The last few days, I’ve felt uncertain, nervous and edgy because I never knew if I’d get the results I deserve. My future was in the government’s hands after I was downgraded. I don’t think it was fair how they did it as every cohort and every student has different qualities and capabilities. You can’t base a schools’ performance on their history.“I studied so hard, I was always in the library and had been going to bed at 3am to make sure I got the grades I wanted. Education means a lot to me. My parents tell me ‘work hard and you can achieve whatever you want’. My mum was brought up in Jamaica and had a hard life, but she’s my role model and inspires me to be the best I can be as a person.“Now I’m going to call Warwick to secure my space to study law after they said they would accept me if my grades change. I’m looking forward to being able to go to a Russell Group university. It’s a privilege not many people in my family have gone to university. Still, I’m going to miss my mum’s cooking.”Leah Glenday, 18, is from Essex. She was the first pupil from her school to be offered a place at Cambridge. Fostered from a young age and late to learn to read or write, she wanted to become a barrister specialising in family law. She wanted to help people going through experiences similar to hers when she was younger, but lost her chance when her predicted grades were downgraded. It is still unclear whether she she will be able to go to Cambridge or not.“It’s been so good to see no-one accepted the grades and that everyone fought back because they know what they deserve. It shocked the government, they didn’t understand we’re the generation who won’t sit back. If we don’t think it’s right we will fight back. Still, I’m just surprised they actually U-turned. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t make such a change. It’s been very, very stressful.“I’m still so confused, all my teachers are very unclear about what they’re allowed to do regarding how our grades were assessed. My predicted grades were A*AA but my assessed marks were AAB. Should I get excited again to finally go to the university I’ve always dreamed of, to risk it being thrown back in my face? I’m not going to get my hopes up and be let down like before. My teachers have said they’ll let me know about my grades as soon as they find out.“Even if I get the grades, people are saying there may not be any accommodation left which is worrying me. I was only preparing myself to go to Cambridge … I never really looked into my insurance choice, what they have to offer in terms of financial support for accommodation is very, very different. I’ve been speaking to my social worker to try and get my maintenance grant changed.“But I’ve just got to be positive now and hope for the best, that I can get to where I want to be. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, not just me but the thousands of other people who had their grades downgraded. I’m feeling so many types of emotions right now, I don’t know what to feel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4b95fc730bcb32ab9a20794ec371f500f1556a/0_26_3631_2179/master/3631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f709c855326a8a93f1e28c9ce11b5e1a","title":"delaying a year wont be an option for many a level pupils says penny mordaunt","story":"Delaying a year ‘won’t be an option’ for many students, says Cabinet Office ministerPenny Mordaunt has become the first serving government minister to go public with concerns about the exam grades crisis, as a growing number of Conservative MPs call for a change of tack.With details of the A-level appeals process still unavailable four days after the results were published, many Tory MPs have become increasingly exasperated with the government’s handling of the issue.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has made no public comment since an interview on Saturday in which he said there would be, “no U-turn, no change”.At least 20 Conservative MPs had made their concerns known publicly by lunchtime on Monday.Mordaunt, the paymaster general and a Cabinet Office minister, tweeted that she had “been in touch with a large number of students and parents re exam results. Seeking a further meeting today with the minister.“I will be supporting colleges in their appeals, working to ensure those who have the grades on appeal can go to uni this year if that is what they want. This group of young people have lost out on so much already, we must ensure that bright, capable students can progress on their next step. Delaying a year won’t be an option, and it shouldn’t be an option. For many it will mean falling out of education.”She added: “I have also made my views on GCSE results known to DfE. Will be posting updates later today.”Mordaunt became the most prominent of a string of Tory MPs who have called for the government to get a grip on the crisis.Stephen Hammond, a former minister and Conservative party vice-chair, told Sky News that the A-level results process has been a “shambles” and that the exam regulator, Ofqual, must come up with a clear appeals process for students by 5pm on Monday.“It’s gone very rapidly from some clarity to a shambles and I think what is clear now that by the end of the day there needs to be an appeals process that is fair, resolves matters quickly, simple and transparent to understand so that we can help all those who feel distressed, frustrated by the grades they have been given.”The Conservative MP Bob Neill, the chair of the justice select committee, agreed that the government and Ofqual must provide a clear appeals process by the end of the day. He said teacher-assessed results should also be given for GCSEs on Thursday to avoid another A-level-type fiasco.Stubbornness could have been behind the decision not to follow Scotland’s lead by announcing a U-turn and using teacher-assessed grades instead of the algorithm, he suggested.“They have got to give teacher-assessed grades. It is the lesser of evils. This is an exceptional year and they ought to realise that.“The harm potentially done to a signifiant number of people outweighs the academic niceties of maintaining this approach.“We shouldn’t be afraid to change our minds – sometimes it’s not a sign of weakness. Just because Nicola Sturgeon has gone down that route, is not necessarily a reason not to do it. We shouldn’t allow that to get in the way.”The equalities committee chair, Caroline Nokes, said her committee would be keen to become involved in investigating what she called the A-levels “debacle”.Other senior Conservative MPs including Tim Loughton and Iain Duncan Smith have also expressed concerns about the anomalies created by Ofqual’s grading algorithm.The former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who was recently given a peerage by Boris Johnson, warned her colleagues publicly on Sunday that the issue “needs gripped”.“This is not just one of these bubble issues. This is something that cuts through everything. MPs should be telling the chief whip, including conservative MPs, that this will absolutely be one of the things that, even people who don’t even pay attention to politics, will be all over because this is their child’s future,” she told Times Radio.Tracey Crouch, a former sports minister, told constituents in a Facebook post: “Now that it is clear that Ofqual think it is a flawed algorithm, we should revert to the teacher grades.”The former Liberal Democrat schools minister David Laws, now the executive chair of the Education Policy Institute thinktank, joined the former Tory education secretary Lord Baker in calling for this week’s GCSE results to be delayed.“It is essential that GCSE grades are not published until Ofqual is confident that they are fair and robust and will not lead to further speculation or uncertainty and a requirement for mass appeals,” he said.“Ofqual has tried hard to maintain the overall credibility of the exams system this year, but this seems to have come at a very high price to fairness to inidual students. In making a choice between guarding exam standards and fairness to inidual students, it is much more important to prioritise fairness to students.He said it was “difficult to avoid the conclusion” that the best approach would be to use teacher-assessed grades for GCSEs, as the Northern Ireland executive has announced it will do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5da49ac587c55fd293cfb2db66bc76e514190926/0_133_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a866445b726044c8d099c6712d55d1eb","title":"how have you been affected by the exam results u turn in england","story":"We would like to hear from young people, parents and teachers on how they feel about the scrapping of the standardisation modelThousands of students, parents and teachers are celebrating after the government made a spectacular U-turn on this year’s A-Level results, reverting to teacher-assessed grades.We want to hear from students who missed out on their first choice university due to the results they received last Thursday, but because of the U-turn have now met their offer.

She has since apologized.Opponents’ fears are justified. Gwinnett county has reported more than 20,000 Covid-19 cases, with local infections rising over the past few weeks. Worried teachers have been holding caravan protests against in-person school reopenings.“The district’s plan sends a clear message that any risk we incur for face-to-face learning is worth it, even if it could mean death,” said David Battle, a middle school teacher in Lawrenceville, Georgia. “Who are we willing to sacrifice for face-to-face instruction?”The Orange County Teachers Association has declared an impasse in negotiations with the district over reopening plans and is suing the district to keep virtual learning in place.“Based on the numbers in Florida it is simply not safe to open,” said Gail Weston McDonald, a middle school teacher outside of Orlando. She has severe asthma and was able to receive a doctor’s note to be approved to work from home. “Sadly the students who will be forced to go to school will be students from lower-income families, putting their lives in danger.”Jeffrey Barrois, an elementary school teacher in Jefferson parish outside New Orleans, Louisiana, said his school already had a positive coronavirus case reported while teachers are attending development and training sessions ahead of in-person classes resuming on 26 August.“They didn’t tell us who the person was. They said there are protocols involved, how they determine who has and hasn’t had close contact, an answer to how, I’m not exactly sure,” said Barrois. “The word ‘strike’ has been used, but we haven’t had an official position taken by our union local.”“I’m trying to make things as safe as possible. I’ve personally been stocking up on different masks. We only received one mask. Teachers are buying their own stuff,” said Batten. “My biggest concern is are we going to lose a student or teacher? That’s what scares me the most.”School districts in most major cities and metro areas around the US are beginning the 2020-2021 school year with virtual learning for at least the first few weeks of school pending the state of coronavirus cases in their areas.But several school districts have begun or plan to resume in-person learning. The openings come after pressure from the Trump administration to open up. “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” Donald Trump declared on 6 July. He has threatened to take away funding from schools that don’t open and called teachers’ union leaders “disgraceful” for opposing his plans.Nearly 100,000 children around the US have tested positive for coronavirus. And as some schools around the US have begun reopening in person, coronavirus cases have spread with quarantine orders already reported in schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Indiana and North Carolina.He explained teachers were concerned over medical accommodations not being permitted to teachers and staff for at-risk household members, how hybrid learning will work, and concerns over lack of ventilation in schools that have traditionally suffered a lack of cleaning supplies such as soap. In March 2020, schools were not closed until 16 March, as 74 public school employees in New York City died of coronavirus.“In March, when they shut down schools, it left a lot of teachers scarred. A lot of educators died and a lot of our students had family members die and it was clear the virus was spreading because schools were open, and schools were left open longer than most jurisdictions in the US,” said Andrew Worthington, a high school teacher in Manhattan and union chapter leader at his school.Worthington explained teachers were struggling to plan for the school year because there is no set school calendar yet and it remains unclear how many students will be opting for virtual learning over in person and how lunches for students in classrooms will work. Teachers in New York City conducted sickouts in March before schools were shut down and are considering using sickouts again to protest against school reopening plans.The New York State Nurses Association issued a statement calling for New York City to postpone in-person school reopenings, citing the ongoing risks of coronavirus and lack of infrastructure to handle super spreading events.“Our government at a federal level and local level hasn’t done enough still to get the pandemic under control, and make it safe for us to be in school buildings with our students,” said Monique Dols, an early childhood special educator in the Bronx. “Our biggest concern is that the school buildings become an avenue for the coronavirus to spread again like what happened in March.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53840a3d44fcb1766161a2f372574dbb730ed85/0_147_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c847ef98e0643ad28549a461f17dcd","title":"from farm to factory the unstoppable rise of american chicken","story":"How industrial chicken farming transformed an ‘alternative’ meat to the most consumed meat in the USA century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy.How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat?The story starts with corn.At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing.“Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand.“It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry.During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place.Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out.“In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat.Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird.These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits.For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken.But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling.Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat.The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white  rock.The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions.The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants).The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds.White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers.Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly.Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach.With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifes, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date. Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry.“If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken.As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering inidual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross.Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store).In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world.“Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.”Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.”Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961.But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end.The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the .While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown.Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices.“We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw.The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers.People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts.Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines.Meanwhile, farmers who had ersified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips.While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.”He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common.“When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK.Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a62c1343957b9847d799736335acc8d290e73e/0_124_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ae0db0863055309cae72ff8250e400","title":"us chickens literally sitting in each others waste says rspca brexit","story":"Chlorination of hens and use of pig sow stalls among disparities highlighted by charity ahead of post-Brexit trade talksUS hens have half the living space of UK birds and are dipped in chlorinated water after slaughter to kill bacteria growing on them as a result of the birds “literally sitting in each other’s waste”, according to a new video being launched today by the RSPCA.Aiming to highlight the welfare differences between US and UK farm animals as trade talks resume between the two countries in September, the UK’s largest animal welfare charity is taking the unusual step of releasing a video that “exposes the realities of animal welfare” and warns consumers against US dairy, egg and meat imports.The RSPCA believes lower welfare agri-food imports will weaken the UK’s animal welfare standards and hurt farmers. Its video comes with a petition asking the government to include legal guarantees in the post-Brexit agricultural bill that will ensure “imports produced to lower animal welfare standards than our own will not enter the UK”.September’s fourth round of US trade talks is preceded by this week’s EU-UK talks. The RSPCA additionally fears a no-deal Brexit would increase pressure on Britain to sign a US-favourable trade agreement.“And it’s not just about this government or this trade deal,” said the RSPCA CEO, Chris Sherwood. “We need to be future-proofing our agriculture systems here for the next 10 or 20 years. To do that, what we need to see in the agriculture bill is a cast iron commitment, clause number one, that protects our farmers and our animals from lower welfare imports.”RSPCA Assured is the charity’s food labelling scheme, and operates independently of the main organisation.Farmer and director of the UK’s Sustainable Food Trust, Patrick Holden, said though he supported the RSPCA’s actions, more needs to be done. “It’s no good being slightly better than the US. We need to be much better. If we are going to transition to a sustainable food system then we need to stop producing cheap pork and cheap chicken in the UK.” He acknowledged that would increase food prices, but said cheap food has hidden costs for the environment and public health.Commenting on the RSPCA’s video and petition a UK government spokesperson said in an email: “This government will not sign a trade deal that will compromise our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards. Our food regulators continue to provide independent advice to make sure all food imports comply with our high standards. Decisions on these standards are separate from any trade agreements. We are focused on getting a deal that works in the best interests of the UK.”Jim Monroe, from the US National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said: “Over the last 10 years, the United States, on average, has been the top exporter of pork in the world. In any given year, the US pork industry ships products to more than 100 countries. That’s because we produce the safest, most nutritious and most affordable pork in the world. We do so while maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare. Any characterization to the contrary is preposterous.“NPPC supports a stronger trade relationship with the United Kingdom, but will only support a US-UK free trade agreement if the UK is willing to eliminate all tariff and non-tariff barriers and embrace Codex and other international production standards.”Dr Ashley Peterson, seniorvice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council said: “Poultry processors consider the welfare of the birds a top priority. Not only is it the right thing to do ethically, but it does not make economic sense to mistreat the birds.”“The US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has guidelines and directives addressing appropriate handling of birds under the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act, and chicken processors strictly adhere to their animal welfare guidelines. This whole process is routinely audited internally, by independent third party auditors and by customers. It is monitored on a continuous basis by FSIS inspectors.”Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

It’s a great celebratory exclamation. It just makes everyone happy. It’s got to be one of the most famous lines in film history.I grew up in Goldthorpe, Yorkshire. Every Saturday, we’d go to the Empire to watch Flash Gordon with Buster Crabbe. He was a wonderful, sensitive Flash Gordon. It had marvellous music and special effects with dragons, lion men, walking bombs and the Clay People who lived on Mars and spoke backwards. You’d get one half-hour episode each week. Flash would always end up looking like he was about to die, leaving you wondering how he would escape. We’d come out of the cinema and run down the disused railway embankment to play dares. I’d jump over the bushes pretending to be Vultan. I never dreamed that one day I’d play him as a grown man in my 40s.I was invited to Elstree to meet the producer Dino De Laurentiis and the director Mike Hodges. There were all these paintings of me on the walls. I thought: “The sods are having me on – they’ve already cast me.” So I said: “That’s me.” They said: “No.” I just happened to be the spitting image of the character from the comic. Dino said: “We can’t think of anyone else for the part.” I said: “If you offer it to anyone else, I’ll strangle the bastard.”I’m very critical of people who say it’s a camp film. It’s not. It’s perfection. Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Stewart and Derek Jacobi all agree with me: it’s a masterpiece. It was the first time space wasn’t just a black sky. And Queen’s music is amazing, like when Flash and Dale go up in the rocket and collapse into each other’s arms to the sound of Queen’s In The Space Capsule (The Love Theme).The sets are marvellous, too. Everyone’s perfectly cast. It’s a masterpiece of colour, design and acting, with a wonderful comic-strip style. They must never, ever entertain redoing it. There’s always some tosser who wants to repeat things, but they won’t ever better it, so they’d better keep their bloody hands off.Because they were going to be building such massive sets, Dino De Laurentiis wanted to plan a sequel right at the outset, and I was offered the job of directing Flash Gordon 2. “I am the wrong director for this,” I said. “I don’t know about special effects or Flash Gordon or any other American comics.” I was brought up on the Dandy and the Beano. We left it at that, but then Dino fell out with the first director and came after me again to direct the first film. He flew me out to New York on Concorde with a bumper fun book of Flash Gordon. I met Danilo Donati, the costume designer, and with fear and trepidation, I said: “OK. I’ll do it.”We had a problem with the skies, until the special-effects team came up with a way of forming clouds by injecting colours into saline water and slowing the footage down. We largely cast to match the looks from the 1930s strip cartoon. The acting just followed. Flash had to have a chiselled jaw, the all-American boy. Dino’s mother-in-law saw Sam J Jones on the TV show Hollywood Squares, so we flew him over. I know he’s got Rotten Tomato reviews, but Flash isn’t supposed to be the sharpest knife in the drawer. He’s genuinely innocent and you can believe he’s a football player.Dale had to be the perky, New York girl. I don’t know who decided that the Hawkmen should have beards. I remember watching Wales beating the hell out of England in the rugby and the phone rang and it was Dino who said: “The team in red. Number nine. Number five. Number four. Number one. Hawkmen.” I said: “They’re not going to want to hang on wires for six months while we film them.” He hung up and the Welsh rugby team were never mentioned again. Brian Blessed comes at the beginning of the film but disappears until nearly the end. He played the role with such enormous energy that I was extremely grateful.The film works on two levels. It’s a Saturday morning action movie for children but, on another level, I think it had a serious effect on some men’s sexual fantasies. They loved the voluptuous Princess Aura.Forty years later, the eight-year-olds who watched it as children can now watch it with their own children. The children will see the innocent side and the adults will see the sexual side and the circle will start again.• Flash Gordon: The 40th anniversary 4K edition is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44dfbdeeb512fa3e4973027014dd2e9c259cd1b9/0_457_4580_2747/master/4580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba267b842f82299f97ba8689996a019","title":"nigel slaters work from home lunch recipes","story":"Get away from your desk to enjoy pastrami sandwiches, crispy-fried kefir chicken, and raspberry burrata focacciaI work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember. Lunch neither refreshes nor recharges unless I am several feet from my place of work. Even if this, often the shortest of all meals, only takes 10 minutes, I always move to another room to enjoy it.It is all too easy not to stop for a break. To pick at something as you type or talk. But I believe we should stop, even if just for a few minutes. It is crucial for our wellbeing and probably good for our work too.OK, I need little excuse for a bite to eat. A sandwich perhaps, a hastily thrown together fridge-raid piled on a piece of thick bread. As such it is fine, but I think we can do better. You can toss a few prawns in a quickly made marinade, or some pieces of chicken into a bowl of buttermilk, and they can sit calmly doing their thing, until you are ready to cook. The hard part is partially done by the marinade as you work.The prawns can be grilled or fried in a wok, they can be wrapped in lettuce and eaten in the hand or tossed into a deep bowl of noodles. That chicken, now tender and ready for you, can be dipped into paprika-seasoned flour and fried, and eaten hot or given time to rest. I also think such a recipe works cold, each piece of crumbed chicken dipped into a bowl of mayonnaise.The sandwich can be a classic affair of pastrami on rye spread with cream cheese and cucumber. But it could also be something new, like the one I made with focaccia dipped in maple syrup, toasted and topped with berries.With the clock ticking, it is unlikely lunch will be a drawn-out affair. But it will, in my house at least, be taken away from the desk. I shall not share my lunch with my laptop.I have a fondness for the cardboard-wrapped delights of the takeaway sandwich shop. Those layers of soft bread and peeping fillings have more appeal to me than that of simply convenience. At home I am more likely to make an open sandwich, adding a curl of smoked salmon or a fold of ham or whatever comes to hand in the fridge. What appeals to me is having something more interesting than butter or mayonnaise to spread on the bread. Ricotta with mint and chopped radish a spicy apple chutney stirred through mayonnaise grated beetroot folded though cream cheese with poppy seeds and a sprinkle of cider vinegar, perhaps.For an open sandwich of pastrami I made a spread of cream cheese and grated cucumber. I could have added chopped gherkins and capers too. If mascarpone isn’t around, try ricotta or a full-fat cream cheese.Such a recipe, light, well-seasoned and spreadable, is suitable as a dip too. A bowl of soft cheese and herbs in which to dip a freshly picked, pencil-thin carrot or a blistered curl of pork crackling.Makes 6 small open sandwichescucumber 300gdill a small bunchmascarpone 250ggrain mustard 2 tbspsalt and pepper to tasteradishes 8dark rye bread 6 thin slicespastrami 200g, thin slicesSlice the cucumber in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Coarsely grate the cucumber, place in a sieve balanced over a bowl and leave for 15 minutes.Finely chop the dill. Put the mascarpone in a bowl, add the dill, mustard, salt and pepper and mix briefly. Slice the radishes into rounds.Squeeze the grated cucumber with your hands to remove much of the water, then stir the cucumber into the mascarpone. Spread this thickly onto the slices of rye bread, then lay a slice of pastrami on to each one. Add a few radishes and a twist of ground pepper.I like having something partially prepared, waiting calmly until I’m ready to take a break from work. Chicken, soaking in a marinade, will sit quietly in the fridge until you feel like tossing it in seasoned flour and frying it till the inside is juicy, the skin crisp as ice. I make a batch, eating some hot and setting the rest aside to eat cold. Chicken, marinated in buttermilk, is an American classic, but buttermilk is less than easy to find. Thwarted once again, but with my mind set on fried chicken, I decided to use kefir. The resulting batter was light, crisp and deliciously fragile. Blessed with the same tang as the traditional recipe, I would do it again. Kefir is certainly easier to track down than buttermilk nowadays. (If neither can be found, you could add a squeeze of lemon juice to a tub of natural, unstrained yogurt.)The chicken can marinate overnight. The flouring and frying and subsequent baking will take 45 minutes. You can have most of the chicken for dinner and keep a couple of pieces back for lunch the following day. I make a salad of shredded white cabbage to go with this, seasoning it lightly with white wine vinegar and dill while the chicken crisps. We used large free-range thighs, finishing them in the oven to cook them right through, keeping the batter crisp. This has the advantage of making them less greasy too. If you have small chicken thighs, then you may find they are cooked after the initial deep frying. Keep the oil at 170C-180C and check carefully that the chicken is thoroughly cooked to the bone.Serves 3chicken thighs 6, bone in, skin onkefir 500mlgarlic 4 clovesolive oil 3 tbsprosemary leaves 1 tbspsea salt 2 tbspsunflower or groundnut oil about 200mlplain flour 150gsmoked paprika 2 tspground chilli 2 tspred or orange peppers 2, largePut the chicken thighs into a deep bowl and pour the kefir over them. Roll the thighs over to completely coat them, then cover and place in a fridge for anything up to 24 hours.Peel and thinly slice the garlic, warm the olive oil in a sauté pan, then add the garlic and fry for 3 or 4 minutes till it starts to colour, then add the rosemary and continue cooking for 1 minute. Lift the garlic and rosemary out with a draining spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Add the sea salt and wipe the pan clean.Set the oven at 160C fangas mark 4. Warm two-thirds of the sunflower or groundnut oil in the pan to come halfway up the thighs. Put the flour into a shallow bowl and season with the smoked paprika and ground chilli. Remove the thighs from the marinade and press into the seasoned flour, making sure it clings generously to each piece. Lower each piece into the hot oil, no more than three in the pan at once. The oil should fizz and bubble immediately.Fry the chicken for about 4 minutes until the underside is golden, then turn carefully and cook the other side. Secure a rack or cooling tray over a roasting tin. Lift each piece of chicken from the pan with a draining spoon and place on the rack. Continue frying the remaining chicken, then place the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes till deep golden and cooked right through to the bone.Cut the peppers in half and remove the seeds and core. Warm the remaining oil in a sauté pan, add the peppers and fry them for about 10 minutes till soft and giving. Lift out, set aside and discard the oil. Lay the peppers on a serving dish then place the chicken on top and season with the salt and garlic mixture.If you toss together a marinade in the morning, your seafood, meat or vegetables can steep quietly while you work.We did this with prawns this week, letting them sit in a mixture of fish sauce, mirin, vinegar and lime juice. I could have thrown a handful of them on the grill and stuffed them into a soft, flour-dusted bun with some curls of cos lettuce, but used them instead to liven up a bowl of noodles.A marinade has often done its work once the meat or fish is removed. This time, the liquid was simmered down to a few spoonfuls, which we used to dress the transparent angel hair noodles and green herbs. I used mint and coriander but also basil. I’m growing a pot of Thai basil at the moment, so a handful of its purple-stained leaves went in as well.Serves 2For the marinadefish sauce 2 tbspmirin 2 tbsprice vinegar 1 tbsplime juice 100ml (about 2 limes)red chilli 1, medium raw prawns 16For the noodlescucumber 100gmint leaves 12coriander a handfulangel hair noodles 100ggroundnut oil 2 tbspCombine the fish sauce, mirin, rice vinegar and lime juice in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

Cut the cucumber into short lengths and then into large matchstick-sized pieces, then put them in a bowl with the mint leaves and coriander.Put the noodles in a heatproof bowl, pour a kettle of boiling water over them and set aside while you cook the prawns.Warm the groundnut oil in a shallow pan. When it starts to sizzle, add the prawns and let them cook for 2 minutes. Remove the prawns, then pour in the marinade and leave it to bubble for a couple of minutes until it has reduced by about half.Drain the noodles and add to the cucumber and herbs. Add the prawns, then the marinade and toss everything together.Of all the useful things to have around for a casual lunch, a bowl of aubergine puree takes first prize in my house. A spread for warm flatbread the heart of a pasta sauce a condiment for grilled lamb cutlets or something in which to fold chopped tomatoes, coriander leaves and fried onions.You bake an aubergine or two, scoop out the silken, honey-coloured flesh within, and mash it with a fork. It is a blank – though delicious – canvas to which you can add your own seasonings. For which, read: a drop or two of olive oil, a fistful of mint, some pomegranate seeds or a scattering of toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Shredded basil and a crumbled block of feta chopped cherry tomatoes and sautéed courgettes brandy soaked golden sultanas and soft fried onions are all good too.A roasting tin of aubergines takes about an hour to cook to melting softness. It’s a quick task to slit the skins open and scoop out the centre with a spoon. And there it can stay, in a bowl in the fridge, until you are ready. This time, we used it as a spread for toasted baguettes, scattering the surface with crisp, spiced chickpeas and a handful of toasted seeds.Serves 4aubergines 3 mediumolive oil 4 tbspgarlic 1 headchickpeas 500g, tinned or bottledras el hanout 3 tsptomatoes 200g, assortedbaguette 1 largeFor the toppingpumpkin seeds 1 tbspsesame seeds 1 tbspsunflower seeds 1 tbspdried thyme 2 tspsea salt 1 tspSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Put the aubergines in a roasting tin, pour over the olive oil, then tuck the head of garlic among them. Bake for about 35 minutes then remove the head of garlic and continue cooking the aubergines for another 30 minutes or until they are completely soft.Separate the head of garlic into cloves then squeeze each one in turn to remove the soft, creamy flesh within.Remove the aubergines from the oven, break them open and scoop out the soft centre of each into a bowl and discard the skins. Reserve the oil in the roasting tin. Stir the garlic cream into the aubergine.Rinse the chickpeas and add them to the reserved aubergine oil in the roasting tin. Stir in the ras el hanout, then bake for 20 minutes, till the chickpeas are sizzling.Finely dice the tomatoes. Remove the chickpeas from the oven and mix with the tomatoes.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds for 5 minutes or so over a moderate heat till fragrant, shaking the pan regularly as they cook. Add the thyme and salt, then set aside.Split the baguette in half lengthways, then cut each half into two pieces. Toast the cut sides. Spread the aubergine mixture over the toasted surfaces, top with the chickpea and tomato mixture, then finally the toasted seeds.I am not sure whether this is sweet or savoury – or even if it matters. The idea was inspired by the classic treatment of sheep’s cheese, apricots and honey I have eaten all over Greece and the Middle East. Soaking the bread in honey (I have used maple syrup too) produces simply gorgeous toast: deep gold and crisp on the outside, saturated with syrup within. You should probably make sure it’s a plain or herb version rather than one studded with olives or sun-dried tomatoes. If you have no raspberries, use apricots or blackberries, or, as I did the other afternoon, deep red cherries.Cut the focaccia in half horizontally and then into 4 squares. Put them on a baking sheet, cut side uppermost, and trickle with the maple syrup or honey. Place under a heated overhead grill for 8 minutes or so, until they are golden and lightly crisp.Break or slice the burrata and ide between the focaccia, then cover each with raspberries. Dust the surface with ground pistachios and serve.

Every time it caught my eye, which was often, I admired it, then thought “must-put-in-fridge-before-it-wrinkles”. It had started to wrinkle by the time it reached the fridge. I also suspected a soft spot, which I hoped would go away in the fridge drawer. Strangely, it did not go away, and the next day I picked up the pepper and put my thumb through its side. Fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, dry: the five stages of decomposition, one of the few things I remember from biology lessons at school. They are the stages of vertebrate animal decomposition, I know (I feel them all), but surely they can be applied to fruit and vegetables, too? As hard as I try to be vigilant, I usually have something at all five stages of decomposition in my kitchen, especially at this time of year, when the window between firm and ripe with a halo of fruit flies is not a big one. Tomatoes, apricots and peaches are the trickiest: the kitchen counter in August is a sort of incubator, but the fridge numbs out flavour, and in the case of tomatoes alters their flesh so you get that soft, mealy texture when they’re brought back to room temperature. Again, I feel this. I also know the red pepper should never have been in the fruit bowl it was careless, and now here I am with my thumb inside a soft, gaping hole.Active decay requires action. “It won’t hurt you, Just wash or scrape it off, cut it off or out.” I’m glad to have learned these lessons young from every woman in my family, and to have had them fortified by Vincenzo, who is his grandmother’s grandson and even more ruthless than me – only not as careless. Cutting off the rotten bit felt like amends for my carelessness. As did slicing what was left and cooking it slowly in olive oil with sliced red onion and, after a while, ene, then treating it all to a handful of pine nuts, currants, sugar and vinegar for what turned out to be a Sicilian-tasting sweet-and sour-mixture to have with potatoes.I have used ene, escarole and romano lettuce in this dish, and they all worked beautifully, wilting down into floppy rags but retaining their sturdy midribs. I’m sure rocket or radicchio would work, too. The thing to remember is to let the onions and peppers cook until they have lost their raw, sunny crunch and softened completely. This takes time, so don’t rush or be afraid to let the edges of the peppers and onions catch ever so slightly: in this, you catch flavour. It turns out that slightly wrinkled peppers actually do this more effectively and willingly than fresh, muscly ones.Not that I am advocating carelessness or decomposing vegetables: simply noting that if you did happen to encounter active decay, use it to your advantage: sweet and sour.2 red onions1 large red pepper6 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove1 pinch red chilli flakes1 tbsp pine nuts or chopped almonds1 tbsp currants (optional)1 tbsp sugar1 tbsp red wine vinegar1 small head ene or lettuce, cut into thick ribbons800g waxy potatoesPeel and halve the onion, then cut it lengthways into slender new moons.

Setién meanwhile met with sporting director Eric Abidal in a city restaurant as the club looked to reach an agreement for his departure.The 57-year-old has a release clause that allows him to leave the Netherlands national team for Barcelona. Koeman has made no secret of his ambition to take charge but he must decide if he wants to do so in far from ideal circumstances exacerbated by the humiliation of their 8-2 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich.The former Southampton and Everton manager was approached by Barcelona in January but did not want to walk away from the Netherlands five months before Euro 2020.Koeman is understood to have been offered a two-year contract but there will be presidential elections at the club by next summer at the latest. His continuity would be in the hands of whoever succeeds Josep Maria Bartomeu as president and the leading opposition figure and the favourite to win, Víctor Font, has made it clear that if he is elected his manager would be Xavi Hernández.Bartomeu’s preference has been the former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and he had been backed by Ramón Planes and Eric Abidal, in charge of the technical secretariat. But it is likely that Abidal, the fourth sporting director that Bartomeu has had, may also be sacked in the coming days and other board members urged the president to rethink owing to Pochettino’s identification with city rivals Eyol.Pochettino had previously said he would prefer to go and work on his farm in Argentina than manage Barcelona, although he distanced himself from that remark in an interview with El País last week, insisting: “you never know.”Faced by pressure from his directors, some of whom have called for him to walk away amidst the crisis and pave the way for new elections immediately, Bartomeu called Koeman to take over. On Sunday night, he departed the Camp Nou and admitted that Setién was “out” and a 14-person board meeting – eight of them at the Camp Nou, six joining online – ratified that decision the following morning although there was still no announcement by mid-afternoon.The board also discussed the post of sporting director, the restructuring of the squad, with mass departures necessary before any signings can be made, and the possibility of bringing forward presidential elections – with early 2021 among the options. Bartomeu does not plan to face the media but a statement is expected shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2f67182a178a8c5a5d663b651ab530c0248a247/0_106_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f51af5f78067d9a5e1c4d5205e0f490a","title":"womens champions league last eight team guides no 2 atletico madrid","story":"The team have strengthened but five recent Covid-19 cases have put a huge cloud over their preparationsAtlético Madrid qualified for their first-ever WCL quarter-finals in October, but it is probably fair to describe that as the only bright spot in their most inconsistent season since 2016. The team may have finished second in Primera Iberdrola but they were nine points behind Barcelona and failed to reach the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.Having had three different coaches during the 2019-20 season, Atlético have been unstable and unreliable. First, the coach Sánchez Vera surprisingly left in October. Pablo López was appointed as his successor and although he managed to take them into the last eight of the women’s Champions League for the first time, his contract was terminated in January following a spell in which Atléti drew four out of seven games.So now they are preparing for the WCL quarter-final with a coach, Dani González, who has been in charge for only seven games. He has a lot of new players at his disposal, so their playing style and formation under him is still a bit of a mystery.Sánchez Vera was happy for his team to sit back and soak up pressure while Pablo López’s team focused more on possession, which is something Dani González favours too. “I’m discovering other ways of working with him,” the goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin told L’Équipière last month. “We’re really working on the Spanish game: the passing, the possession. There’s also a lot of physical work.”The team have changed a lot in the past few months. In May, the Spain international Virginia Torrecilla discovered she had a brain tumour and began treatment. Nine players, including several previous starters, also left during the summer.There are also concerns over whether they will even be able to play their quarter-final against Barcelona on Friday after five players tested positive for Covid-19 last week and they had to cancel all training sessions. Uefa has said Atlético will need a minimum of 13 players, including one goalkeeper, to play.This Atlético looks very different from the one that finished nine points away from Barcelona in March. Some high-profile players have left, including the goalkeepers Lola Gallardo and Sari van Veenendaal as well as Kenti Robles and Elena Linari, but the club have acted to sign good replacements.Hedvig Lindahl and Pauline Peyraud-Magnin are an extremely strong goalkeeping duo while Meryl van Dongen and Alia Guagni will both add depth to the defence. Turid Knaak, Emelyne Laurent and Grace Kazadi have all arrived to bring new energy to Atléti’s attack.Dani González did not have much time to shape the team to his own possession-based playing style before the coronavirus outbreak. González, who played for the men’s team in 1995-96, has been part of the club’s staff since 2010. In June, the club renewed his contract until 2021. “The goals for this season are to continue to grow as an organisation and to solidify a way of working that allows us to reach an optimum level in all the competitions,” he said when he extended his contract.During the last three years, Ángela Sosa has scored 27 goals and in the 2018-19 season she won the league’s MVP title. Surprisingly, her performances were not enough to be included in Spain’s Women’s World Cup squad. She has great vision and an eye for goal, but there are rumours of her leaving the club, and her participation in the last eight is not yet guaranteed.During the coronavirus crisis Atlético’s Silvia Meseguer, who is about to finish her medicine degree, volunteered to help at Madrid’s temporary hospital, IFEMA. Meseguer has been trying to balance her education and football career for years and last season she retired from the Spanish national team to be able to focus more on her medical career.Leicy Santos joined on a loan from Santa Fe at the beginning of the season. Although the Colombian has only played 170 minutes in the WCL, she has proven to be the team’s best signing this year and a key part of Atléti’s midfield. This summer, the club signed her permanently on a contract until 2024.Barcelona are the favourites in the quarter-final, even more so after Atlético had to suspend training due to the Covid-19 cases, but their new signings also make this team unpredictable. But even if they could get past Barça then Wolfsburg – who should defeat Glasgow City comfortably – are likely to be too strong. The German side have already beaten Atlético twice in this competition, making it hard for the Colchoneras to dream beyond the semi-finals.This is Atlético’s fourth participation in the Women’s Champions League and the very first time they have qualified for the quarter-finals. They have been knocked out in the Round of 32 once by Wolfsburg (in 2017-18), and in the Round of 16 twice, by Lyon in 2015-16, and Wolfsburg in 2018-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f6cae4aa30ad66dae5f17aa41a79fccca8945/0_187_1368_821/master/1368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24da72c75293e2b5ba43b34aa824b61f","title":"how we met he just grabbed me and gave me a big snog","story":"Lynn and Kim Davies, 53 and 54, found love on stage after their characters shared a kiss. They live together in a small Worcestershire villageLynn Davies moved to Worcestershire from Bristol in October 1999, trading in city life for a country village. “I was working as a freelance television writer. I wanted the chance to explore a rural lifestyle and find a real community,” he says. He had only been there for a few days, when a shopkeeper suggested he go to the village hall for a drama club meeting. He didn’t realise until he got there that it was an audition for a play.When he arrived, he spotted Kim Cresswell, who worked as a housekeeper at a country estate and had joined the group to meet new people. “I thought she was striking. But I couldn’t start chatting someone up the minute I’d arrived.” He submitted a form to join the group, and Kim noticed that he had trained at Lamda, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re having him. We won’t see anything like that in this village again.’”Before they knew it, they had both been cast in the play. “I’m not sure we’d even exchanged names before we had to rehearse this scene together,” Lynn recalls. It was a romantic scene, where the characters kissed. “He just grabbed me and gave me a big snog,” laughs Kim. “The characters clearly liked each other so I figured we should probably do it properly,” Lynn adds.Later that evening, there was a party and the pair got chatting. They snuck into the village hall kitchen to share a bottle of wine. “I knew by the end of the evening that I was going to marry him,” says Kim. “I told my best friend and she said I was utterly mad. I had to take him to see her so she could make sure he was good enough.” Luckily, Lynn aced the interview.The couple took things slowly over Christmas and began dating properly in the new year. By March 2000, Lynn had moved into Kim’s house, where she lived with her five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. “They adored each other from the start. On one of the first nights he put her to bed, I remember them getting out her drum kit. I had to laugh,” Kim says.They married in September that year on Iona, a remote island in Scotland. “Lynn suggested it and I thought: ‘Why not?’ It was organised over the phone.” They didn’t tell anyone about the wedding, but persuaded the local vicar and his daughter to travel up to perform the ceremony. “We asked the landlady and landlord of the bed and breakfast we stayed at to be our witnesses. It was just us, them and a tourist who was visiting the church at the time,” says Lynn.They took pictures on the beach before heading out for a meal together. “We wanted a small private wedding and Iona is an incredibly spiritual place,” says Lynn. Kim trusted his judgment. “I’d never been on any adventures before we met and now we’ve had so many.”The couple say they complement each other well. “I’m a country mouse and he’s a town mouse,” Kim says. “I’ve introduced him to all the community activities he came looking for, and he holds my hand when we go to the city.”Over the years, they have been involved in many small productions, from village plays to special events like the local asparagus festival. Although they don’t perform together as much now, they still share a love for drama. “We go out to different historical sites and always end up raiding the dressing-up box,” says Kim. “We just enjoy taking silly pictures and having fun together.” They also try to travel to Iona every year for their anniversary.Lynn supported her recent career change, and Kim now works for a mental health crisis line. “He makes me laugh all the time,” says Kim. “And I’ve learnt more from him than I ever did at school. He’s pushed me to be better and I owe him a lot.” Lynn describes his wife as the most thoughtful person he has ever met. “She’s the only thing that keeps me sane. We don’t have to do anything to be happy together.”• Want to share your story?

It’s been a sanctuary to return to from countless trips around the region, a place where the rigours, and sometimes dangers, of Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere could be set aside for a while.In Lebanon, I could get things done. For all its faults, it’s a can-do place, where resourcefulness has got its people through. And it’s needed to be. Almost nothing works as it’s supposed to here: just getting by requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and a handyman.Few of the things we would take for granted elsewhere – electricity, clean water, waste disposal, the internet – are a given here. I’ve become proficient at each, just as I have in overlooking the country’s profound flaws. The dysfunction that underwrites Lebanon is part of the pact of living here. But no one could have guessed that it would end up destroying Beirut – literally.The explosion that thundered through the city on 4 August was clearly not normal. Since the end of the civil war, there had only been a few explosions here – car bombs that assassinated people. But this cataclysmic event was of a different magnitude. Whole streets of buildings were wrecked the closer to the port, the greater the chaos. I’d experienced explosions in Baghdad, Aleppo, Gaza, Mosul and southern Lebanon, but always during war and never on this scale. What on earth had just happened?As the dust cleared that fateful night, as the cascading of glass from high-rise towers slowed, the panicked aftermath of the blast turned to cold anger this had probably been very preventable. It wasn’t a hostile act, but a disaster borne of staggering incompetence and indifference to the welfare of the city’s residents.Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, one of the more lethal explosive compounds, had been stored in a shed at the entrance to town for six years. Within days of the blast, we learned that fireworks had been kept in the same shed, and a welder may have started a fire that ignited it all.The chain of events was unfathomable, as was the sheer scale of the damage. All the places where my formative memories of Beirut took shape were destroyed. Many of the people who helped shape them were wounded, some of them badly. I’ve made a career in the Middle East trying to keep a dispassionate distance from the events I’ve covered and people I’ve met. But that nominal barrier didn’t apply this time. This was personal.Everything that had blighted Lebanon – the corruption and incompetence of its leaders, the indifference of officials, nepotism, non-state actors, the widespread abuse of power – had come together in an apocalyptic storm that had shocked the world. How on earth could it have been allowed to happen?More than a week later, a broken city is still wrestling with the aftermath, as it is with the truly existential question of whether a functioning country can emerge from the ruins. Paying for the damage is beyond the capability of a bankrupt state already brought to its knees by three decades of industrial-scale corruption.International aid will help with the first stages of recovery. Life will go on for the Lebanese who decide to stay, or can’t leave. But what sort of an existence will it be here? If this isn’t the impetus to put the state on a more credible and sovereign footing, could anything succeed in turning things around?My house is repaired (I was 1.2 miles from the centre of the explosion), as are those of friends and colleagues who were closer to the port. If there is a “normal” left in Lebanon, I’m somewhere near it. But life here is unsettling now, more so than at any point in Lebanese history this is the moment of reckoning.I moved to Istanbul from Beirut 18 months ago, and I’ve been back a few times since. Every trip it’s been obvious how quickly Lebanon is sinking into intense poverty because of the financial crisis. It’s been sad to watch it unfold from afar. I was actually supposed to be travelling to Beirut for the first time since Covid-19 lockdowns lifted the week of the explosion anyway, and had already braced myself to see a much changed country. I didn’t expect to be frantically making phone calls and sending messages to check on the whereabouts of friends in the aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded.When you’re flying into Beirut, one of the easiest landmarks to spot from the plane is the port, with its giant grain silos towering over the eastern, Christian side of the city. I used to use it as a marker to figure out where my old apartment was from the air. The night after the explosion, the whole docks area was ablaze with rescue teams’ floodlights, and the hipster-ish neighbourhood of Mar Mikhaël behind it – my old home – lay in total darkness. It was surreal.It truly is difficult to comprehend the scale of this disaster. A friend showed me the remains of his flat and I couldn’t understand how he was still alive. The first apartment I lived in in Beirut, 900 metres from the port, was blown to smithereens. Luckily, my elderly neighbours were not home at the time.The speed with which teams of volunteers from all over the country mobilised to help those whose homes were affected is a true testament to the kindness and generosity of ordinary Lebanese people. Their dedication to helping out neighbours and strangers alike stands in stark contrast to the non-existent clean-up effort from the state. More than once I saw groups of police and soldiers standing by, looking on as citizens did all the work.One thing that will probably stick with me – and all Beirutis – forever is the sound of broken glass, absolutely everywhere, all the time: falling from tower blocks and skyscrapers being swept or bulldozed out of half a city crunching under your shoes like fresh snow.It’s one thing to report in war zones and dangerous places when you’ve made careful calculations about risk and you know what to expect when you arrive. Scenes of devastation akin to Syria or Iraq in a place you considered as home, and as safe, is heartbreaking in a different way. The people of Lebanon deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d290253d871b5808cb40e69388f5b2cbfd3fa2fb/690_1049_3743_2248/master/3743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583202b1fe6b78f88b9fdcd7687f6403","title":"farewell to pete way bassist ufo","story":"Too wild even for Ozzy Osbourne, UFO’s Pete Way, who has died aged 69, set the bar for rock excess – but also for what the bass guitarist could bring to a hard rock bandPete Way was made for the 1970s, when to be a rock musician was as much a chance to live exactly as one wanted, as a means to make music. As Ozzy Osbourne put it, unnervingly: “They call me a madman, but compared to Pete Way I’m outta my league he’s fucking mental!”But if it’s easy to simply push Way into the box labelled “Wild Men of Rock” – not least because it would be hard to dispute the proposition that his best musical days were done by the 1980s – it would also be unfair. As the bassist of UFO from 1968, he was a major creative force in the band who, alongside Thin Lizzy and Judas Priest, built the bridges between the the blues-based hard rock of the 1970s and the much sharper lines of the emergent metal scene of the late 70s. Not for nothing were UFO favourites of Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, who still take to the stage to UFO’s Doctor Doctor.UFO, who had begun as a bluesy, slightly dull space rock band, were transformed when the wunderkind German guitarist Michael Schenker joined in 1973. Very quickly they shifted to a melodic hard rock, and by the late 70s they were a very distinctive group indeed, with Schenker’s guitar lines intertwining with Paul Raymond’s keyboards and Way’s bass playing, which rarely took the least-resistance path of playing endless root notes.Way also emerged as an important writer for the band: Only You Can Rock Me, one of the great hard rock singles of the late 70s, was pretty much all his work, and he contributed to a bunch of their best songs – Lights Out, Too Hot to Handle, Shoot Shoot, Natural Thing, Mother Mary and their hit single Let It Rain. More than, that, though, he helped reinvent the role of the bass player: not just the bloke who stood still at the back of the stage in front of his amp, but a showman, part of a troika of showmen who fronted the band, along with Schenker and singer Phil Mogg. They made their reputation on the road, especially in America, leading to the live album Strangers in the Night, capturing them at their zenith as an arena rock band. Patterson Hood of Drive-By Truckers saw them in 1977, opening for ACDC, and told me: “They were beyond phenomenal. ACDC was great too, but I’ll go to my grave swearing that UFO took the night.”Speaking to me last year, Schenker characterised the personalities of the members of UFO (he described himself as “shy and fragile and sensitive”). Mogg, he said, was “the control freak” drummer Andy Parker was the butt of the jokes, but accepted it because he liked the attention Way was “the very friendly outgoing person”. He was also, Mogg told me, the practical joker. “He would change the sign on the Holiday Inn to Welcome Andy No Neck Parker and The Puppet Show. He would get the hotel to change it.” On one occasion he stole a hotel manager’s dachshund to take to that night’s show, returning afterwards to find the manager devastated, assuming he’d lost his dog.Way left UFO in 1982, disgruntled at the poppier direction they followed. He formed Fastway with “Fast” Eddie Clarke who had left Motörhead, but in true Way fashion, left to join Ozzy Osbourne’s band before Fastway had recorded a note. He then formed his own band, Waysted, the name an accurate reflection of his interests (he was not deserted by his admirers: Waysted toured the UK supporting Iron Maiden, and Osbourne joined them onstage to sing Paranoid at their Hammersmith show with Maiden). But Way would never hold the same place in hard rock as he had with UFO, and his career tailed off into the familiar round of band reunions, side projects and solo albums.So Pete Way died in the way most musicians do, no longer near the spotlight. That he deserved his place in that beam, though, was evident as the tributes rolled in over the weekend. From his former bandmates, of course, and from his contemporaries and those he inspired – Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, Kirk Hammett, Saxon, Tom Morello, Pearl Jam, Nikki Sixx, Geddy Lee. It’s worth noting the number of bass players in that list, because no matter how colourful his life, it’s the music he left behind in those few years with UFO that will be his legacy.• This article was updated to remove an image that had been wrongly labelled by a photo agency as featuring Way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a893ec10de2c62f8b0737c831bf1b5164a45a77/0_224_4299_2579/master/4299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d7dedcda26b06a17304dc03fcc63a6","title":"house music rian evans watching and listening highlights","story":"This week, our critic reveals a constant craving for Alban Gerhardt’s Bach, hears a pastor attempting an operatic heart-to-heart with God over Zoom and remembers Julian BreamI’ve had Gerhardt’s Hyperion recording of the six Bach Cello suites on constant rotation during the last few months. Calming and stimulating – whatever the need – this is just a taster. Gerhardt’s brilliant musicianship knows no bounds, as he proved back in 2009 at the premiere of the concerto Chin wrote especially for him: he played it from memory. Seeking the concerto out again, the playing was indeed as intensely expressive as I remembered, with all Gerhardt’s characteristic mix of freedom and fastidiousness.In 2009 I also heard the South African soprano Pretty Yende in the role of Clara in Cape Town Opera’s production of Porgy and Bess. She’s gone on to an international career and so I was keen to watch her as Violetta in the Opera de Paris production of La Traviata. Director Simon Stone opts for a contemporary setting – glitter-branding and wheelie-bins – and Yende does the glamorous superstar with ease.On an altogether different scale, the second series of #OperaHarmony’s micro-operas opens with Rose Miranda Hall’s 15-minute Wisdom of Stone, setting words by Candace Evans. Shot at the ancient Château de la Rochelambert in the Auvergne, it deals with the isolation of Elise who, in her state of anguish, seems to hear – emanating from the castle walls – the voice of a woman who over the centuries had faced the Black Death and other outbreaks of the plague. Elise, sung by Anne Sophie Duprels, gradually accepts that she must listen to the wisdom of the ages, learn from what lies deep in the stone. While the libretto is sometimes overwrought, there is something evocative embodied here.By contrast, Essential Business uses the single unchanging camera angle of a laptop as an American pastor attempts a heart-to-heart with God via Zoom. Covid-19 has denied him the healing touch core to his ministry it has also killed his daughter. Composer Judith Lynn Stillman and writer Anna Pool trace the rapid unravelling of a man of hitherto unshakeable faith, and the fine baritone Will Liverman credibly captures Pastor Harris’s vulnerability. #OperaHarmony pieces that rely on visual trickery say much less, but it’s clear that in the present circumstances composers are more than willing to challenge existing conceptions of the operatic form.On learning of the death last week of Julian Bream, watching the film My Life in Music by Paul Balmer felt like a small gesture of homage. At two hours, it’s very long, yet Bream talks with such witty and disarming candour the time flies by. There is, moreover, remarkable archive footage of Stravinsky, Walton and Britten, among others, as well as performances from Bream himself on lute and guitar.I’ve enjoyed returning to Sara Mohr-Pietsch’s Radio 3 series of Composers’ Rooms. They’re vividly conjured and often very revealing of the composers’ character and methodology as well as their self-doubt and little foibles. Betsy Jolas’s charm is a foil for her constitutionally iron discipline Howard Skempton, whose every note is perfectly placed, knows exactly where everything is in his work room.The very first in the Composers’ Rooms series was Oliver Knussen, a big – and big-hearted – man with a liking for small things. Find that conversation and then go on to listen to Monday’s Proms performance by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra of his Second Symphony, recorded in 2012. Written when Knussen was 18, it sets poems by Georg Trakl and Sylvia Plath. Tuesday night’s Proms Classic is the European Union Youth Orchestra with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting Brahms’ second and fourth symphonies (1994).

He explains how music gave him a voice – and what he wants to say nextIt’s a crisp December night in the heart of Taipei, and Freddy Lim is presiding over a campaign rally to remember. Flanked by his bandmates, and looking out over a 50,000-strong crowd, he steps to the front of the stage and lets out a guttural scream. Even without the CO2 cannons, video screens and orchestra at his back, or the facepaint daubed on his forehead, it’s an unlikely scene for a parliamentary candidate in the thick of a re-election campaign.“During the campaign I was so exhausted every day,” he remembers, looking back on the events of 21 December. The night’s rally-cum-concert has just been released for posterity as Taiwan Victory Live, his band Chthonic’s latest live album and concert film – as well as a document of his two vocations, metal and legislative politics, mid-collision. “But on stage, I felt like I’d been refreshed, like there were thousands of people at my back and I could do anything,” he grins.“Those people banging their heads and moshing, exchanging energy with you, they provide something very unique, deep in your soul, that can support you to keep going. I’m so happy we did it, because my team had debates over whether voters might have wanted their member of parliament to seem more serious. If I went back to being a metalhead, would it be a good image? But a lot of fans and supporters, after that concert, tried to mobilise campaigns to convince people to vote for me in my district. I don’t think any other kind of event can do that.” He held his seat.Since forming in 1995 with Freddy on lead vocals, Chthonic have become cultural ambassadors for Taiwan – its history, myths and struggles. China maintains that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China: not a sovereign entity, but a rogue province that will one day be brought under its control. Acknowledging Taiwan’s independence, and risking reprisals from China, has therefore become awkward for other countries. As a result, Taiwan is excluded from the World Health Organisation and the United Nations, has official diplomatic ties with only 14 UN member states, and since emerging as a democracy in the late 1980s and early 90s, has faced internal tensions between pro-independence and pro-China factions.Releasing eight albums of uncompromising, category-defying metal and playing hallowed metal arenas such as Donington Park and Ozzfest, Chthonic have drawn lyrical themes from their country’s past, telling the stories of indigenous peoples and their mistreatment. It’s something that evolved naturally in Freddy’s life and writing, but gradually began to convey a real sense of responsibility.“During our teenage years we feel a lot of pressure from outside, and there are a lot of complicated emotions on the inside,” he says of what drew him to metal. “Through high school my parents got orced and I faced some difficulties within my family. Metal allowed me to relax and release what I was feeling. Later on I found metal bands who were not just expressing emotions but also had thoughts on issues like racism, conflicts between different ideologies, or were trying to uncover their country’s mythology and culture. When I formed Chthonic, I started to think more about what ideas the music could carry. And when that involves complicated issues about society, you have to do more, to contribute more.”He says events in the country’s history, such as the violent repression of the indigenous Seediq people by Japanese colonists in the 20th century, or the years between 1949 and 1987 that were spent under martial law (often referred to as the White Terror), “come with heavy burdens. When we read these stories, we feel a lot of deep emotions. I need to get the feelings they bring up out with music, or I’d explode, I think!”As Chthonic’s career progressed, the whole band became more and more heavily involved in championing human rights causes. Bassist Doris Yeh has been an eloquent spokesperson in the global metal press, turning a spotlight on everything from the Awakening Foundation, a group that combats gender-based discrimination and inequality in Taiwan, to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy Umbrella movement. And in 2007, the five-piece memorably hit the US on what they branded the “UNlimited Taiwan” tour, calling attention to Taiwan’s exclusion from international organisations such as the United Nations.“Before that time the Taiwanese government had tried to buy ads in the political columns and introduce what’s happened between Taiwan and China, and why Taiwan couldn’t be a member of those international organisations,” Lim remembers. “I don’t want to say that those ways have been useless, but they’ve put a limit on our imagination. With music, with movies, with more soft power, I think Taiwan can show different sides, and make people want to get involved.”Freddy was elected as chair of Amnesty International Taiwan, a post he held between 2010 and 2014. But after the Sunflower Movement brought a new wave of youth activism in the country, occupying the Legislative Yuan arm of parliament in protest against a trade pact that would bring the country more into alignment with China, he began to feel that standing on the outside was no longer enough. “I started to try and convince more people that they should get involved directly in politics to push their ideas. I hit a point where I thought: I can’t only be a supporter, I have to work with them.” He formed the New Power Party (NPP) and ran for office in 2015.After being elected as a member of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan in 2016’s election as part of the fledgling NPP, running on a platform of social justice and support for Taiwanese independence, Freddy used his first term in office to champion progressive causes. The theme he comes back to most frequently is the importance of breaking an older generation’s stranglehold on political office.“Nowadays, the metabolism of politics of Taiwan is quite healthy. I can see a lot of young people getting involved or running for office. It makes our politics healthier and more erse.” He laughs. “For example, in politics when people mention me, they see me as part of the young generation. Come on, I’m 44!Choosing to run as an independent in search of his second term – part of a coalition of young independent candidates on the progressive end of Taiwanese politics, Democracy Frontline – Freddy was banking on that very generation stepping up and getting behind him. It seems to have worked. At the election this January, he won in a tight race against a representative of the traditionally conservative, pro-China Kuomintang party. “Mobilising young people and working together, across party lines – it’s very important. This is the right place for me.”Now, Freddy’s two worlds are coming together again in his new podcast with Emily Y Wu, Metalhead Politics. He views it as a forum for publicising Taiwanese political issues worldwide (particularly the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic) while also serving as a launch-pad for new material from Chthonic.“We’re discussing how, maybe instead of albums, we should write more singles and release them once in a while,” he muses. “We don’t play live too much, maybe once a year in Taiwan only. If we can write some new songs or produce the concerts well with some unique ideas, we can put them online so fans anywhere can also enjoy the shows and new music. It’s important to get people listening to what’s going on here – whether they’re metalheads or not.”• Chthonic’s album Taiwan Victory Live, and episodes of Freddy Lim’s podcast Metalhead Politics, are both available now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51614fe759336777a1200a7433e5b79555470d0e/189_224_3020_1811/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89cad4d2785b93b5384139d2cead657","title":"alex salmond scottish government refuses to hand legal papers to inquiry","story":"Documents on harassment complaints too sensitive to disclose, says deputy first minister John SwinneyThe Scottish government has refused to hand over significant legal papers to a Holyrood investigation into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, claiming they are too sensitive to disclose.John Swinney, the deputy first minister, told the specially convened Scottish parliament committee that the government would withhold its papers on the former first minister’s legal action against it, its own legal advice and key documents from its internal inquiry.Opposition MSPs on the committee are furious, accusing the government of sabotaging the investigation and muzzling civil servants. They are now considering applying to court for legal papers to be released and could invoke a clause in the Scotland Act 1998 which allows Holyrood to compel the disclosure of government documents and to compel witnesses to appear.The committee inquiry will start hearing oral evidence on Tuesday by calling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, who oversaw a botched internal inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond launched in early 2018. Salmond denied the allegations.Salmond sued the government in August 2018, accusing it of breaching natural justice by failing to allow him a proper chance to defend himself. He won the case after government lawyers admitted in court in January 2019 the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign.Evans will give evidence under oath, and has insisted on bringing with her the Scottish government’s most senior solicitor. Salmond, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the Scottish National party, are due to appear before the committee later this year.The committee will also investigate Salmond’s allegations that Sturgeon’s close aides and civil servants orchestrated a witch-hunt against him – a charge Sturgeon has rejected.Those allegations intensified during Salmond’s subsequent court appearance on 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, although the Holyrood inquiry will avoid any discussion of those allegations or the evidence heard during the trial.Salmond was acquitted on all charges by a high court jury after his lawyer alleged there had been a conspiracy involving some of the 10 women involved in the case, senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP.In a letter published on the eve of the Evans hearing on Tuesday, Swinney rejected the committee’s repeated demands for release of legal papers and internal reports on the original harassment inquiry, claiming the documents were legally privileged.Swinney added that ministers could not release reports or notes from civil servants who investigated the first two complaints against Salmond. Ministers would, however, support an application to the court to release its submissions to the judicial review taken by Salmond in 2018.Swinney and Evans also insist civil servants cannot be expected or compelled to offer opinions on what happened, claiming that would breach the civil service code. MSPs on the committee believe that is an attempt to muzzle officials, and have warned Evans and Swinney they will use their parliamentary powers to ensure transparency.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, and a committee member, said: “It is so disappointing that the Scottish government, having promised cooperation and transparency at the start of this process, now appears to be turning its back on that pledge.”Alex Cole-Hamilton, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, added: “This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish government deeply embarrassed.“The committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest. That evasiveness does not serve the people of Scotland well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea92443c12df133d6fb1c70ada598f","title":"have you accessed a food bank in the uk for the first time coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the coronavirus pandemicAccording to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July, millions of people went hungry or relied on food bankds during the first few weeks of lockdown.We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the pandemic.How have you been coping and what was your experience like?

He discusses hope, horror and survivalJoe Tracini calls the voice in his head Mick, after Jagger. “I see it as the Rolling Stones lips. Just a massive mouth screaming all of the time.” Is he a fan of the Stones? “I know nothing about them, but I respect them because they’re not dead. And, like me, they definitely should be.”The actor, TV presenter, comedian and former magician is becoming known as a radical voice in mental health at a time when the nation’s mental wellbeing has taken a hammering from the pandemic. Over the past year, particularly through lockdown, he has become the public face of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a destabilising condition that can make life really hard for people.Tracini, the son of the popular entertainer Joe Pasquale, was a child prodigy. In 2003, he was the British junior magical champion and was named the most promising comedy act by Ken Dodd. He was only 15 years old endless opportunities lay ahead. He attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London and learned how to sing, dance and act, before starring on TV in My Spy Family, Coming of Age and Hollyoaks. But, for a long while, drugs, alcohol, BPD and despair got the better of him.Although initially the videos were primarily for his benefit, he thought lockdown would be a particularly difficult time for a lot of people. “I made a couple of videos about how I cope with thinking about killing myself. I assumed there were a lot more people thinking about it than there had been. And it turns out that I am an expert in not killing myself, because I’m not dead.” He grins.He also wanted to open up because the condition is so stigmatised. “The only place BPD comes up is when somebody killed somebody in a crime documentary. People don’t talk about personality disorders, because if you do that calls into question who you are as a human being. That is really scary. A close friend said to me they didn’t want to think about the fact I had a personality disorder, because my personality was the bit they knew and if that wasn’t in order maybe they were wrong about me.”Tracini, 32, has a sweet baby face (Joe 90 meets Alan Carr) and a life-affirming smile that belies everything he is talking about. He is supremely polite, slightly geeky and wears T-shirts that show off his elaborately tattooed arms (and disguise his self-harm scars). He lives in Hackney, east London, but is staying at his mother’s S-shaped bungalow in Rochester, Kent, when we speak on Zoom.In his videos, we often see two Tracinis on a split screen. The one on the left is straight Joe, trying to explain his condition to the world, while the bloke on the right wearing the BPD T-shirt goads him, taunts him and obsesses about the fact that Dick Van Dyke is trending on Twitter (“Dead or racist? It’s normally one of those two things these days”). While serious Joe worries that “tomorrow is not a given”, BPD Joe retorts: “What d’you mean tomorrow is not a gibbon?” and asks why he is always going on about monkeys. Sometimes there is no split screen, just Tracini explaining that talking about killing himself in front of so many people is a form of insurance – the more people he tells he won’t do it, the less likely he is to do so. His videos have been viewed more than 40m times.In one video, Tracini sings a song about the erectile dysfunction caused by his BPD in another, he wears a snorkel and a thong to protect himself from Covid-19 elsewhere, he chats to Miriam Margolyes while she is chomping on a raw onion to ensure he keeps his social distance. Tracini is fascinated with language and wordplay. Why are bees’ knees so special, he asks he has never even seen a pair. On another occasion, he breaks down the word hopeless – it does not mean he has no hope, just that he has less hope than others. At one point, he says he always feels empty – as hollow as a chocolate Father Christmas.When Tracini was finally diagnosed with BPD in his late 20s, it was life-changing. “I felt such relief knowing that what I had was a thing, because my immediate thought process on it was: if it’s a thing, you can fix a thing. I thought I was beyond repair. I thought that I was utterly done for ever.” He was told that long-term, regular therapy might make it slightly better. It was good enough for him. It gave him hope.Tracini tells me about the condition’s nine traits, as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association. All of these affect him, many at the same time. “Fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive self-destructive behaviours, explosive anger, self-harm, paranoia and disassociation, extreme emotional mood swings and an unclear, unstable self-image.” He pauses. “It’s a very human thing to lessen your own struggle by going: ‘Yeah, but everybody has this stuff.’ But I’m not going to do that, because I do know that mine’s worse.”He made his first short video in January, because he had spent his life telling lies and he just wanted to tell the truth, unadorned, however painful it was. “The only reason that I’m able to be so honest is because I’m doing it to the back of an iPhone,” he says. “I’m not gonna go into Sainsbury’s and go: ‘Hi, how are you, I suffer with erectile dysfunction.’”Tracini says he has never quite been sure who he is. He was born Joe Pasquale, like his father. His mother, Debbie, played bass guitar for a band called Family Affair. (His parents split up in 2008.) He remembers making his first joke on stage at the age of 18 months, when Pasquale brought him on. “I pulled at my hair and said: ‘This is a trick Paul Daniels can’t do.’” Was he really only 18 months old, I ask in disbelief. He nods.Despite having four sisters (three from his father’s first marriage), he did not much engage with other children or childhood. “I was a real novelty, because I spoke and thought like an adult. I wrote my own stuff and would do five to 10 minutes at the end of my dad’s act when I was seven years old.” He adored his father and wanted to be his double. “I’ve got hundreds of hours of me on film. And it is essentially me, this tiny little boy, being my dad.”As soon as he was old enough, he changed his name. He chose Tracini because his grandfather, wrongly, told him it was the original family surname. “My adult career has been trying to undo everything that I taught myself growing up about how to be like my dad.” He still adored his father he just wanted to be his own person – whoever that was.By the age of 12, he was done with traditional school. He was sick of being bullied – one boy tried to strangle him with his own scarf, while another locked him in a skip for three hours. His cousin, who had flunked university, taught him in the shed at the bottom of the family’s garden in Kent. He dedicated himself to magic and was soon good enough to make a living from it. “My first gig was a children’s party aged 12, for a 13-year-old’s birthday.” Did he earn much? “Yeah, I think I earned more in cash than I ever have done since. But I used to put it back into the act. So I’d just buy more magic.”In hindsight, he says he did magic only because he did not have friends. “I didn’t know how to talk to another person without getting a deck of cards out or without entertaining. I physically could not function around other human beings if I wasn’t working.”He quit magic after he turned his hand to acting. Success came easily, but he did not know what to do with himself in his spare time, so he started using cocaine. “All of the money I had went on drugs. I was spending about two and a half grand a week on cocaine.” When he gave up drugs, he became an alcoholic. (He has been drug-free for eight years and sober for five). As he got older, his behaviour became more and more extreme. He does not remember much of that time. He attempted suicide multiple times, although he counts only one attempt as genuine. His friends and family stuck by him. Tracini says he hates to think of the agonies he put his parents through. He begins to weep.Life is just so exhausting, he says, that there is not a moment when he is unaware of himself. Has he never felt inner calm? Actually, yes, there was one day, recently.“It was my 32nd birthday,” he says. “And I stopped thinking. It’s like I had a day off from being me. I was happy. And I only realised that I was happy when I quite quickly became unhappy again. So, yes, it does stop. And I can try and live for those moments.”Despite his poor mental health, Tracini has had a stable professional life – he has rarely been without work. He left Hollyoaks in 2014 after a three-year stint, thinking he would go on to something bigger and better. But there was nothing bigger than trying to quell the voices in his head. He briefly returned to Hollyoaks in 2018, after his diagnosis, but acting gigs were increasingly hard to come by. Since 2017, he has presented the children’s TV show The Dengineers (“Basically Grand Designs for kids”) with Meryl Fernandes. In December, it won a Children’s Bafta for best factual entertainment show.Despite all his pain, he seems to want to make people happy, I say. “Well, there’s that Robin Williams quote, where he says the saddest people like to make people happy because they know how it feels to feel utterly worthless and they don’t want anybody else to feel like that,” he says.When he started posting his videos, thousands of people wrote to him, checking how he was and telling him he had made a difference to their lives. Some asked him for advice, which astonished him. “People thinking about killing themselves should not ask for advice from me. It’s like a chicken asking Colonel Sanders for advice. It’s not gonna happen and, no, I can’t help you.” He sounds fierce, but he is laughing.Tracini can’t stand most of what is said in the media about mental health – he says so much of it is po-faced or exploited by celebrities to promote a product. “I used to be watching, thinking: ‘Yeah, great, when’s your album out?’” So many mental health narratives are sugar-coated, he says. “It’s empty and fluffy, like: it will get better. I’m a lot of things, but I’m not fluffy and what goes on up there isn’t fluffy. It’s not a nice little gif with a hug.”I mention his girlfriend, Holly Houseman, a professional dancer who helps with his routines. Suddenly, I hear her voice in the background, all light and laughter. Tracini says he worries that he does not give enough back in the relationship. “That’s ridiculous, because otherwise I wouldn’t be with Joe,” she says. Does she find him as exhausting as he does? “No!” She looks at him. “Even on your worst days, you still make me laugh.”How has the relationship changed him? “It’s given me something to live for more. Having Holly in my life has made me feel more capable of some sort of future, though I can’t think long term.”“Well, we talked about getting a rabbit and that’s quite long term, because we haven’t got a garden yet!” says Houseman.Tracini is developing a BPD standup routine, which he hopes to take on the road. “It’s called Ten Things That I Hate About Me. It’s basically a Ted Talk gone wrong,” he says.He knows that nobody will turn up to see him they will be there for Mick, the abusive loudmouth in the BPD T-shirt. I ask if he has a name for the quiet, contemplative Tracini. “Funnily enough, I have a T-shirt with ‘Me’ printed on it. But I don’t wear that one.” He does not really know that fella well, he says. Perhaps he will start wearing it when he gets to find out a bit more about him, I say. “Yeah, not half,” he says with a rush of enthusiasm. “It cost 24 quid!”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The presence of the sun removed some of the demons and Azhar Ali did not wish his trio of pacemen to expend too much energy they should have a lot of work to do when the final Test of the summer begins. Even so Mohammad Abbas bowled beautifully again while adding two more wickets to his Test tally. Hopefully, the sun will still remember the location come Friday.Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley gained some more experience and enjoyed a partnership of 91. Watch on this sunlit afternoon and the assumption might be that Crawley has the superior record, which is not the case at the moment. He is a natural timer of the ball and he scores more easily than Sibley he nearly always will. But Sibley usually bats for longer, all of which was the case on Monday.There were two crunching back-foot boundaries from Crawley off Abbas then he popped down the pitch in Yasir Shah’s first over to loft the ball over mid-off. He does not seem too fazed by Test cricket but having posted a half century he was lbw to the first ball of Abbas’s second spell. Sibley then departed in an all too familiar manner, caught down the leg-side off Abbas, who seemed keen to keep bowling all afternoon. This is a strange weakness to have, though Sibley can console himself that he shares it with David Gower who, briefly, had a phase of getting out in that manner – hard to think of many other similarities between these two batsmen, however.Both Sibley and Crawley should be around for a while, though the latter looks more likely to excel in subcontinental conditions. Moreover, on tour Crawley can always travel as a spare opener, if necessary. The hope is that he emulates Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick as a batsman who prevails at Test level even though his early record in the county game has been surprisingly modest.Shah became the first spinner to bowl in the match at 4.45pm on the final day and after a little tap from Crawley he started to enjoy himself as well, especially when Ollie Pope was lbw to a devious straight delivery that looked like a leg break. Dom Bess must have looked on enviously he has played two Tests this summer without bowling a ball and in neither case could his captain be castigated. It has just been that sort of summer.This may prompt the England hierarchy to consider leaving Bess out for the last Test here and entrusting the spinning role to Root. With hindsight that would have been the best course for this match. However, a glimpse at the forecast for the end of this week and beyond suggests that the weather is likely to behave better, which means the playing surface is likely to do the same. That would enhance the chances of Bess retaining his place in the team and this remains the likeliest outcome. The only other change might involve replacing Sam Curran with either Jofra Archer or Mark Wood.The second Test will disappear into the annals and will seldom be recalled. But on a fine pitch – it had pace and would not have been so spicy but for the dank, dark conditions of the first two days – Pakistan battled with great character at the crease and yesterday their bowlers gave a reminder of their undoubted class and variety. Let the sun shine on Friday morning and a fine climax to the Test summer is on the cards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a00865a4963ac488d7c0f8228f2f363450b4144/0_102_4268_2560/master/4268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627cf754afa786f4f9f8dd390907fb69","title":"lewis hamilton says pursuing the 2020 f1 title has been a lonely journey","story":"Lewis Hamilton has described competing in Formula One under coronavirus restrictions as a unique challenge. The paddock has had to adapt to new protocols. Thse have been successful but the limitations on social contact have exacerbated what Hamilton called a “lonely journey”.Hamilton won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday with a dominant run from pole to flag, finishing 24 seconds in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton leads the world championship by 37 points from the Dutch driver.Spain was the sixth race this season, concluding the second triple header of meetings during which drivers remained in social bubbles. Ordinarily Hamilton would travel between races, visit family and pursue his interests in fashion and music. It is a worklife balance the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolf, has highlighted as vital for his driver to deliver such a high level of performance. However, because of coronavirus Hamilton has curtailed his lifestyle and for all the races he has been staying in a motorhome at circuits to minimise any risk of infection.“The journey of an F1 driver in the fight for a championship can often feel like a lonely journey,” he said. “That is magnified this year with having to limit the people in your bubble and moving around. In the past the travelling and other things I found positive, being around friends to find the perfect balance. This year is much harder to implement the other things that keep the balance. This year is a real challenge and test mentally.”The season is set to run to at least 15 races with a full calendar expected to be announced next week, when the triple-header of meetings at Spa, Monza and Mugello commences. When they conclude F1 will have completed nine races in 11 weeks. “I am not seeing my family but I am focused and as driven as ever,” Hamilton said. “It is a marathon not a sprint so I am keeping my head down and know I will enjoy myself a little bit more at the end of the year and can hopefully be with family.”Mercedes have won five of the six races but Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, has only one victory, at the season-opener in Austria. With Mercedes so dominant, Bottas was best placed to challenge Hamilton but he was only third in Spain and third at the previous race at Silverstone. He is 43 points behind Hamilton and has admitted the championship may already be out of reach.“I have no clue actually what the points’ difference is, but it’s way too big,” he said. “I can see again the championship drifting away. Apart from the first race, it’s been pretty bad. There’s not been a weekend that has gone smoothly and without issue, apart from the first one, so a pretty bad season so far. Obviously, that’s disappointing.”MotoGP’s Franco Morbidelli, who was involved in a crash at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, has demanded that riders be held accountable for their actions despite the accident being ruled a racing incident.Morbidelli collided with the rear of Johann Zarco’s Ducati and both riders fortunately emerged unhurt. The accident also almost took out Valentino Rossi and Maverick Viñales.Zarco appeared to move off line while braking to defend against Morbidelli and the latter clearly believes he should have faced sanction. “Braking like this at 300kmh is really having little love for yourself and those you are racing with,” he told Sky Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5fb0ace0580882bb78bf329cb206c165dca331/0_288_4538_2724/master/4538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28bb55d6154a6c9f2820f2e537d83b81","title":"simona halep top 10 player pull out of us open","story":"When Simona Halep confirmed on Monday she was joining five other top-10 US Open refuseniks, all of them from outside the United States, the tournament organisers could do no more than sigh, reshuffle the women’s draw yet again and hope this was the end of it.It probably is, given most of the serious contenders have arrived in New York to play in the rescheduled Cincinnati Open, the on-site warm-up event that starts on Thursday. However, in the unlikely event Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka or Coco Gauff were to pull out, the US Open would be in serious personality deficit.They are the big names left in the women’s draw of a tournament whose nervous organisers – naturally concerned about taking a $120m hit through potential lost global television revenue – agonised before deciding to go ahead without fans in the cavernous stadiums of the Billie Jean King Center.The attention was always going to be on Williams, who needs one more title to equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 majors, but who last won there in 2014 and turns 39 next month. The uncertainty around her grew in Lexington, Kentucky, last week when Shelby Rogers won 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) in the semi-finals of the inaugural Top Seed Open to become the first player outside the top 100 to beat her in the past eight years.The scale of the damage in Queens, meanwhile, is already significant. With two weeks to go before what is bound to be a strange opening day, they have already lost the defending champion, Bianca Andreescu, and the world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, along with Elina Svitolina, Kiki Bertens, Belinda Bencic and now Halep, as well as a slew of lesser players.Johanna Konta is one beneficiary of the chaos, moving up to eighth seed on the latest list.Halep, a semi-finalist five years ago, probably would have started favourite in a shredded field, as she is in excellent form. Yet she pulled out 24 hours after beating Elise Mertens, 6-2, 7-5, in convincing style to win the Prague Open. The Russian Irina Khromacheva replaces her.Halep revealed before Sunday’s final she has trained only on clay during the sport’s five-month shutdown and will now continue her preparations for the Rome and French Opens next month.It never looked likely she would risk a trip to New York, given her concerns about the continued and random spread of Covid-19 across the United States and it seems she was unconvinced that even the rigid safety precautions the United States Tennis Association have insisted on would be sufficient.Angela Buxton, a British tennis player and former doubles partner of Althea Gibson, has died at the age of 85. Buxton paired up with Gibson as the American became the first black person to win a major in 1956.The ITF announced Buxton\u0027s death on Monday, describing her as an early pioneer of equal rights. Together with Gibson, she won doubles titles at the French Open and Wimbledon in 1956. Buxton also reached the singles final at SW19 that year, losing to Shirley Fry.Gibson went on to win singles titles at the French Open in 1956, Wimbledon in 1957 and the US Open in 1958. Her partner was forced into retirement at the end of the 1957 season, aged just 22.Katrina Adams, a former tennis player who has promoted equal rights in the game, said Buxton championed the friendship and support of Althea Gibson during an era of intense racial isions. Buxton had Jewish heritage and faced anti-Semitism throughout her career.The Liverpool-born player was one of the first to be inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981. Buxton was also inducted into the Black Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015 after raising over $1m to financially support Gibson before her death in 2003.“After weighing up all the factors involved and with the exceptional circumstances in which we are living, I have decided that I will not travel to New York to play the US Open,” Halep said on Twitter.“I always said I would put my health at the heart of my decision and I therefore prefer to stay and train in Europe. I know the USTA and the WTA have worked tirelessly to put on a safe event and I wish everyone there a successful tournament.”On the men’s side, Kei Nishikori, a US Open finalist six years ago, withdrew on Sunday from the Cincinnati Open after testing positive for coronavirus and is almost certain to rule himself out of the grand slam."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdfd126771bac0c60fcdf13487ffb4cf3547d42c/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5a932c36684b9a77e4bd005be910f6","title":"england v pakistan second test day five live","story":"Overnight downpours forced further delays but there was time for some intriguing action, with Crawley and Abbas impressing, before the draw was agreedAnd that’s all from me. Vic’s report on the day’s proceedings will be along shortly. Bye! Mohammad Rizwan is named man of the match after his 72 runs in the first innings.They’ve coped with it as best they can. We were excited about this week. A new challenge for us. It was disappointing not to get as much cricket as we’d have liked. Zak played excellent today. We spoke today about making sure we were very professional about how we approached this session, and I thought for what is a very young top order in particular it’s a great experience for us, to get through this, make sure we can cope with these situations, the conditions, and now we’ve got that in the bank moving forward. That partnership was high-class really on a very challenging surface.We’ve got a huge game haven’t we? We’ll try to finish the Test summer off as best we can. We’ve played some good stuff, 1-0 up in the series and try to finish 2-0.I think it’s been frustrating for both teams. The game was set quite nicely, the conditions were good for bowling throughout, and the total we got we thought we had a very competitive Test match coming up, but unfortunately the weather was the winner. We are taking the challenge of batting first. The heat we thought would have an impact on the pitch but it changed so quickly. Whoever went in fought really hard. Their bowling attack is brilliant obviously and the guys stuck to their task. The declaration took enough overs out of the game to bring the draw instantly into play, and England weren’t enjoying batting enough to extend it unnecessarily. Azhar Ali obviously knew exactly what was coming when he brought himself on to bowl and clearly found the entire experience hilarious. He used to do some occasional bowling but since May 2017 he had now bowled precisely 24 deliveries. Anyway, this is done.43.1 overs: England 110-4 (Root 9, Buttler 0) Azhar Ali decides to have a bowl himself. His first delivery moves off the pitch away from Buttler and past the edge, and England instantly declare!43rd over: England 110-4 (Root 9, Buttler 0) A maiden from Yasir to Root. There should be another 18 overs before the day ends, though the captains can agree to call it a draw at any time from the end of the 46th over onwards. 42nd over: England 110-4 (Root 9, Buttler 0) Root comes forward to clip Abbas past midwicket, but it slows off the outfield so he has to run three. Then one nips back into Buttler, but might have taken a slight edge before hitting the pad, and was a but high anyway. He and Yasir both appear to be having a jolly old time, bowling nicely and doing a great deal of smiling and stuff. 41st over: England 107-4 (Root 6, Buttler 0) Buttler exhibits a full-range of straight-to-fielder shots here, but then misjudges the fifth, which is caught off a thigh pad prompting a half-hearted and wildly optimistic appeal, and then leaves the last.40th over: England 107-4 (Root 6, Buttler 0) Abbas’s first ball moves off the pitch and screams past Root at a little over waist height, the batsman pretty much clueless39th over: England 105-4 (Root 4, Buttler 0) That just skidded on from Yasir, Pope was clearly expecting both more bounce and more turn and he couldn’t get his bat down in time to keep it off his pad.It hit pad before bat, and as soon as that was decided Pope was doomed, because that was taking out a couple of stumps.Pope is given out lbw to Yasir Shah, but got some bat on it and needs very little encouragement to try a review. 38th over: England 104-3 (Root 3, Pope 9) Pope ruins another potential maiden by clipping Abbas’s final ball off his hip and past square leg for four, lovely timing.36th over: England 100-3 (Root 3, Pope 5) Two singles and a three off Yasir take England to triple figures.35th over: England 94-3 (Root 2, Pope 0) Root goes down on one knee to sweep Yasir’s final delivery but gets nothing on it. Fortunately his back foot remained resolutely grounded. The match situation has drained this of much of its drama, but it’s still an intriguing spell of play.34th over: England 92-3 (Root 0, Pope 0) A second successive wicket maiden from Abbas. Sibley’s tendency to feather catches down the leg side is repeatedly costing him.Sibley gets a gentle nibble on a ball heading across him and down leg, and Rizwan takes the catch!33rd over: England 92-2 (Sibley 32, Root 0) Yasir Shah seems very gentle after that.32nd over: England 91-2 (Sibley 31, Root 0) Root leaves his third ball from Abbas, which bounces just in front of Rizwan and rears up past the gloves and into the keeper’s stomach. The next ball is excellent, missing the edge by the hairiest breadth, and then the last keeps a bit low and flicks a pad on its way through, prompting a loud appeal but not interesting the umpire. Six excellent deliveries, and a wicket maiden.Ball tracking has the ball hitting the top of the stumps, and having completed a half-century off his 97th ball Crawley is out to No99! Crawley has been given out, but Sibley indicates it might have been going over so they try a review! 31st over: England 91-1 (Crawley 53, Sibley 31) Crawley completes his half-century off his 97th delivery with a fine shot, sending the ball through midwicket for four. He’s looked in excellent nick today.30th over: England 86-1 (Crawley 48, Sibley 31) Shan keeps going. At this point I suppose there’s no harm to be done. 29th over: England 84-1 (Crawley 48, Sibley 29) A couple of singles off Shah.28th over: England 82-1 (Crawley 47, Sibley 29) Shan opens with a full toss, which Crawley dispatches to the boundary, and then a couple of balls later he sends the ball screaming over the slips for four more. I’m not sure that he’ll get as many as five overs here. “Simon you could let Richard O’Hagan know that he is overlooking the upside of a kilo of fennel sausage in ones knapsack,” writes Kim Thonger, “which is an excellent way to ensure social distancing on a train and indeed an empty first class carriage all to oneself is often the outcome.”27th over: England 73-1 (Crawley 38, Sibley 28) Chance! Sibley goes down the track to Yasir, misses it completely, and Rizwan fumbles a straightforward stumping chance!26th over: England 72-1 (Crawley 34, Sibley 31) Shan Masood has a bowl. He is a very occasional Test bowler, haing bowled in one Test in 2016, one in 2017, one in 2018, two in 2019 (albeit more than 11 months apart) and one in 2019. He has never bowled more than five overs in an innings, or six in a calendar year.25th over: England 69-1 (Crawley 34, Sibley 28) Sibley also has a go at Yasir, hitting nicely through midwicket for four and then cutting a little over-fine, the ball flying not far wide of slip for three. 24th over: England 61-1 (Crawley 33, Sibley 21) A lovely cover drive from Crawley brings four runs. “My late grandfather was a butcher who always said that you wouldn’t eat sausages if you new what was in them,” writes Richard O’Hagan. “Having now learned that people scoff them raw or put the devil’s own fennel in them, I’m inclined to agree with him.” Now don’t you start on fennel, about which I feel much as Matt Whitton (20th over) does about the Lorne sausage.23rd over: England 57-1 (Crawley 29, Sibley 21) Yasir Shah brings some spin, and after a couple of balls Crawley goes on the attack, lifting the ball way over the fielder at mid-off for four. Next ball he goes again, but he doesn’t get hold of this one and gets a single to mid-on.22nd over: England 52-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 21) Shaheen bowls a rubbish full toss at Sibley, who rather like a diner faced with a platter of ossenworst could have tucked in but decides not to. Maiden.21st over: England 52-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 21) “I’m quite resentful that there’s been all this sausage discussion without any attempt to canvas my opinion?” writes Kim Thonger. “As a man who’s been known to make a round trip on East Midlands Trains from Northamptonshire to St Pancras, seldom an uplifting experience, and then cycle on a Boris bike to and from Terroni’s in Clerkenwell, solely to secure supplies of their fennel sausage for a light kitchen supper, I feel my voice must be heard. And well done Somerset for thumping Warwickshire by the way. If ever a county was fuelled largely by sausage, it’s Somerset, despite claims that we live on cheddar and raw onion. That’s just breakfast.”20th over: England 51-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 20) A no-ball and a wide from Afridi. “Two thoughts,” writes Matt Whitton. “1. You’re teetering towards the same semantic cul-de-sac that pie enthusiasts lose themselves - the Lorne is certainly a sausage, despite not being traditionally encased, and is a magnificent example. 2, As far as I’m aware said sausage is named after the Lorne Hotel in Glasgow, where it was invented.” We’re certainly at risk of lapsing into a game of Lorne tennis, which is best saved for our Wimbledon game-by-game coverage.19th over: England 49-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 20) Another Sibley boundary to third man, this off an edge, and that’s DRINKS. “Raw meatloaf? Away and raffle yourself, square (Lorne) sausage is a delight on a par with a Graham Thorpe cut to the boundary and only a scoundrel would suggest otherwise,” fumes Allan MacDonald. It may very well be delicious, it just fails my sausage-classification test on a number of counts. 18th over: England 45-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 16) Sibley turns on the run tap, clipping past backward square for two and the cutting to third man for four. Having taken 44 balls to get to nine, he very nearly doubles his tally in five. England have meanwhile officially avoided the follow-on.17th over: England 38-1 (Crawley 24, Sibley 9) A lovely ball here from Naseem Shah, who tempts Crawley into a drive and just beats the edge. “I’ve tried ossenworst (10th over) and enjoyed it,” reports Adrian Armstrong. “It’s best treated as a pâté rather than a sausage - spoon it out of its casing and spread it on crusty bread. Quite strongly spiced, but not hot like nduja. Doesn’t keep long after opening, as you can imagine.”16th over: England 35-1 (Crawley 22, Sibley 8) Abbas gets one to jag into Crawley and near enough slice him in two. “Having just spent a week in the Toulouse region, yeah the sausages are the best in the known world,” gloats Alistair Connor. “Driving home to Lyon through the Massif Central, we happened to stop in the village of Eygrande in the Limousin, where the butcher’s sign proclaims him “le Roi du Boudin”. So obviously I had to get some of his royal black sausage, which I was obliged to chuck in the freezer when we got home, because my wife occasionally remembers she’s a Muslim (but only if there’s no pata negra available).” On the downside, you’re presumably unable to leave the house for two weeks because of quarantine regulations. On the plus side, royal boudin.15th over: England 35-1 (Crawley 22, Sibley 8) Still four slips in place, as Pakistan go all out for the 19 wickets they need to take in the next couple of hours if they’re going to win this. 14th over: England 34-1 (Crawley 21, Sibley 8) Swoosh! Abbas tempts Sibley into pushing his bat towards the ball, which holds up off the seam and goes just past! The batsman learns his lesson from that and leaves the remaining two deliveries, the last of which cuts in slightly and can’t have missed off stump by much. 13th over: England 34-1 (Crawley 21, Sibley 8) Naseem Shah replaces Afridi, and Crawley edges, but it drops short of first slip! “I realise that Glasgow isn’t exactly a hotbed of cricket fandom and that’s probably why there’s been no mention of it but your assertion that Toulouse is the finest named-after-a-place sausage is nonsense,” rages Bill Criggie. “The Lorne (Named after Lorne in Argyll) or ‘square’ sausage is the best sausage full stop. That can be the only explanation for why we used to have to take some smuggled in a suitcase to family friends who lived in the south of France.”Pah. There’s been some kind of foul-up in the foodstuff-naming department: that isn’t sausage, it’s raw meatloaf. 12th over: England 33-1 (Crawley 21, Sibley 8) There are four slips in place as Abbas bowls at Sibley, but he takes them all out of play by angling it wide of leg, and the batsman clips it away for a couple. Abbas does it again a couple of balls later, but Sibley clips straight to the man at square leg.11th over: England 31-1 (Crawley 21, Sibley 6) Crawley chips over the man at midwicket and runs a streaky three.10th over: England 27-1 (Crawley 18, Sibley 6) “I wonder if anyone has tried Ossenworst?” writes Chris Barry. “My advice is don’t. I ordered it once in The Netherlands, waving away the advice of my dining companions. ‘What’s the wurst that can happen. It’s obviously sausage of some kind.’ Indeed it was sausage, only raw. I finished it if only to save face. Turns out I could meet a sausage I didn’t like.” I’m struggling to understand the concept of raw sausage. Surely the casing would be all bleeurgh?9th over: England 26-1 (Crawley 17, Sibley 6) Now Crawley drives down the ground, but he doesn’t quite time it and the outfield isn’t the quickest, so he has to run three. “Brindisa’s Chorizo is very good, but these Toulouse sausages are pretty good too,” insists Charles Sheldrick. No argument from me. The Toulouse is a great sausage, probably the best named-after-a-place sausage. Some Cumberland fans might disagree, but they’d be wrong.8th over: England 20-1 (Crawley 14, Sibley 5) Abbas goes shortish, and Crawley stands up and pulls past backwards square leg for four, then his last delivery is a bit wide, and Crawley cracks it past point.7th over: England 12-1 (Crawley 6, Sibley 5) A maiden from Shaheen. Ian Forth and Gina Watson insist Will Hargreaves must have been thinking about Graham Gooch’s bowling impressions. Footage is sadly elusive, but here’s an old Rob Bagchi column on the subject:6th over: England 12-1 (Crawley 6, Sibley 5) The sun is shining, and the torrential rain that turned the outfield into soup is a distant memory. Mohammad Abbas starts proceedings with a no-ball, and all the runs come off that and the next. There follow a couple of nasty deliveries, one rearing up to hit Crawley around the waist.Will Hargreaves, is this the action you were wistfully recalling? If so, you owe both Barry Etheridge and Andrew Thomas some gratitude.A couple of thoughts on the action witnessed on the OBO so far today:Now then, there are actual cricketers on a field in Southampton!“These circumstances make me wonder if the returning players will take their tasks seriously,” writes Will Hargreaves. “I seem to remember a test from my youth, at Edgbston I think, in similar circumstances, where one of the bowlers took it upon himself to imitate the others. I have to say, everyone recognised his version of the giraffe-plodding, arm-swinging gait of Tony Greig. To do an Ian Botham he asked the umpire for a couple of jumpers, which he then stuffed inside his own. The crowd were all very amused, as I recall: as were the players, I think. I’d love to see a video link if anyone has one, please?”Hello world! So it falls on me to take you through the conclusion of this Test. I was going to use the word climax instead of conclusion there, but it dawned on me, thankfully just before I committed to it, that it doesn’t actually refer to the final bit of something but to “the most important or exciting point in a story or situation”, so doesn’t really work here. In fact I think we probably had the climax yesterday, during the first five overs of England’s innings, which Vic Marks wrote about so splendidly:And just as we get news of some actual sport, my stint is over. Here’s Simon Burnton to guide you through the staggering denouement. Tea will have been taken by the resumption, and play will go through till 6pm, or till there are 15 overs remaining and everyone’s had enough. I’m not sure how long it’ll be till the teams are shaking hands, but there it is. “The glorious 29,” begins Julian Menz. “Each stop evocative of a half-forgotten St Etienne song, my life-line when I moved ‘North’ to the ‘suburbs’ from Covent Garden, and the start of an enduring love affair with Green Lanes.A lot has changed since the early 90s ... the Queen’s Head pub was still wonderfully ey, with the stickiest pool-hall carpet I’ve ever encountered, upholstered beer crates for stools, and the best juke-box north of Camden.The lamb chops are still the same though. I live abroad now, but get the 29 every time I’m back. Just for those perfect, crispy-fat beauties.”I think it’s gone now, replaced by Dogtas furniture – but it’s not really my section of the route, so I could be wrong. I just came across this, which is nice. I remember being at a summer scheme when Javed scored his double century at the Oval in 1987 – the Pakistani kids were loving it and giving it loads. Looking back, it was probably my introduction to the multicultural beauty of London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744a92094b4b7f17c27d4e056bb300e00ec68e1a/0_319_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7251fe82f7e5df7f7499b760aee49cc9","title":"cameron mackintoshs theatre firms to make more than 850 people redundant","story":"Union Bectu said 185 jobs will go at Cameron Mackintosh Ltd and 669 at Delfont MackintoshRedundancies at theatre companies owned by the leading west end producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh are set to total more than 850.It emerged over the weekend that Mackintosh, the producer of shows including Les Misérables and Hamilton, had notified staff of mass redundancies.The company has declined to give any numbers but the entertainment union Bectu said the figure was around 185 for Cameron Mackintosh Ltd and 669 for Delfont Mackintosh.The head of Bectu Philippa Childs said it had included the numbers in its most recent tally of 5,000 job losses across the wider theatre industry, redundancies brought about because of the coronavirus crisis.She said: “The situation has definitely been forced upon the industry by both the pandemic and a government unwilling to understand the disastrous predicament of theatres unable to reopen safely or viably with social distancing restrictions.“The entire industry has been shocked by Cameron Mackintosh’s unwillingness to use the coronavirus job retention scheme in full or deploy resources beyond the furlough months to support his backstage and front of house staff.“Other West End employers have done their utmost to find creative ways to safeguard the livelihoods of their staff and pursue the bigger mission of saving the world class skills and talents critical to the success of theatres up and down the country.“There are extremely limited options for theatre workers to find employment at the moment and we continue to urge employers to take a holistic approach and retain talent wherever they can.”A spokesperson for Cameron Mackintosh Limited and Delfont Mackintosh Theatres said: “It is a very sad time for everyone affected by this thankless situation, one we could never have imagined would have been forced upon the industry.”Mackintosh, who owns eight West End theatres, has previously complained that there had no “tangible, practical support” from the government “beyond offers to go into debt”.Theatres, performance spaces and concert halls closed in March, and most people in the industry cannot see them reopening fully until 2021.Last month, the government announced a £1.57bn arts recovery package, but that money is primarily aimed at the survival of buildings and organisations – it is not meant to directly save the jobs of workers. Employers say they have a choice: make redundancies or go bankrupt.Ambassador Theatre Group, one of the biggest employers in British theatre, has announced that it will lay off 1,200 casual staff in September. The Southbank Centre and the National Theatre have announced the loss of 400 jobs each."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a54de45813fdc084ea9a6874a0c9cdc5fb11b3/395_387_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=752c41ac3b589ad4bbace1eb80683280","title":"garmin fenix 6 pro solar review the solar powered super watch","story":"An everyday smart sports watch that goes anywhere and tracks everything while lasting a week and charging from the sunGarmin’s latest go-anywhere, do-anything Fenix 6 Pro Solar multi-sport watch recharges from the sun, marking an important step towards the smartwatch you never need to charge.The £739.99 Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is one of the US firm’s top-of-the-line devices, capable of lasting weeks on a charge and tracking practically any stat you’d want, plus it’s able to guide you out of forests when you’re lost.The watch is available with either a 42 or 47mm case, and in various colours and materials, here reviewed in slate grey with red accents and a 47mm case.By every dimension the Fenix 6 Pro Solar means business. At 15.1mm thick and 47mm across your wrist, it dwarfs most other smartwatches. It doesn’t feel enormous when worn, still fitting under shirt cuffs and doesn’t catch on things.It weighs 62g, which is reasonably light – the smaller Fossil Gen 5 weighs closer to 100g. With the included 23g silicone strap, the watch feels well balanced on the wrist and doesn’t slide around once done up. It is comfortable to wear with plenty of adjustment. The 22mm strap can be swapped out for either a quick-release band made by Garmin or any standard 22mm third-party strap.The 1.3in non-touchscreen is a colour transflective LCD display that is clearly visible in direct sunlight and has a backlight for seeing it in the dark. The screen is protected by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 DX and is big and clear enough to see at a glance. It is more animated than Garmin’s similar displays on watches such as the Forerunner 245, but isn’t as slick or as good-looking as the OLED screens on most smartwatches.Five physical buttons take care of controls. Most things are quick and easy to do using the up, down, select and back buttons. If you think of it operating a bit like an old-school or retro Nokia, then you get a rough idea of how it works.Scroll up or down from the watch face for a series of customisable widgets. I have smartwatch notifications first, then a series of health stats including heart, stress and sleep, temperature, solar intensity, a series of running performance widgets and so on there are loads to choose from.Each of the buttons has a press-and-hold shortcut too. I have it set so holding the down button opens music controls, up for settings and holding the light button takes you to a rotating bunch of quick settings, including timers, alarms and Garmin Pay.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar is much less dependent on your phone than most smartwatches you don’t even need to pair a phone to set it up.Pairing with the Garmin Connect app enables alerts of calls, texts and other notifications, control of music, and activity syncing, all of which worked great with a variety of phones. The watch has wifi for syncing directly to the internet, downloading updates or music too. It can be plugged into a computer to sync and update via Garmin Express, which is a requirement if you want to update the built-in maps.Sans-phone, the watch will continue to track your vitals and activities for weeks with a large amount of internal storage, including fairly comprehensive analysis. You could head off into the wilderness for a week without a phone and still do everything, including mapping, which can’t be said of most smartwatches.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar lasts at least quadruple the length of most smartwatches between charges. Used just as a smartwatch with phone notifications and all the health tracking features activated it, the watch lasts nine full days and nights between charges. If you cut down on some of the health tracking, such as the pulse oximeter, wrist heart rate or other bits you can extend battery life by days (up to 14 according to Garmin). A power manager allows you to select from various pre-sets or make your own with certain features turned on or off.However, that’s all without employing the watch’s hidden talent – the Power Glass covering the screen doubles as a solar charger. It works all the time, even indoors, but requires bright sunlight to meaningfully top up the battery. On a week where I spent two hours walking (with tracking and maps) and three 25-minute runs on bright British summer days I got an extra day’s battery from general smartwatch usage.The beauty is that, other than the added cost to the watch which is a not-inconsiderable £140 over the version without the solar charging, there’s no downside to the Power Glass as it’s fully transparent to the eye. You just see the screen and a slim strip that looks like bezel.Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling law.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar has comprehensive health tracking features. An excellent optical heart rate monitor on the back works continuously through the day, alerting you to abnormally high or low beats per minute and recording your resting and active heart rates. It measures Pulse Ox (oxygenation of the blood) both during the day and while asleep, respiration rate, stress, body temperature, fall or incident detection and many more. The only thing it doesn’t have is ECG for tracking heart arrhythmia.Garmin’s body battery system helps you make sense of it all, combining stress, sleep, heart rate variability and other data into a simple in-out system. You charge up your body with good sleep and deplete it with stress, activity and daily life. If you’re about balanced you’re doing a good job, but it’s easy to spot when you’re struggling or not doing enough exercise.Sleep tracking is extensive, including light, deep and REM sleep stages, respiration and Pulse Ox tracking, which together can show signs of issues such as sleep apnoea. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs on the phone or a widget on the watch.Then there’s your standard step, calories, floors and so on, including move reminders.Comprehensive sport tracking covers a list of over 30 activities, but the main ones are running in its various indoor and outdoor forms, cycling, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing, golf and gym sessions of various activities with on-screen animations showing you how to do them.The watch will handle triathlons, but as a runner I focused on hitting the pavement. The Fenix 6 Pro Solar’s outdoor running tracking was first class. It got a GPS lock within seconds, monitored every stat I could want, had a clearly readable display with only the info I wanted on it, gave me pace and lap alerts, performance analysis after 1.5km and handled intervals and more advanced training plans with aplomb. The watch is noticeably larger and heavier on your wrist than something like the Forerunner 245, requiring me to tighten the strap to stop it sliding around.At the end of each run it gives you an aerobic and anaerobic training score, plus an analysis of your training load over the last seven days. The recovery, Vo2 Max and race predictor functions were more accurate than other Garmin watches I have tested too. PacePro allows you to map out a race course and get pace suggestions in real time on the watch adjusted for elevation and other factors to help you hit your desired time, once races are open again.Walking maps were very useful too, providing maps with trails and other features that weren’t visible on Google Maps, making it more effective than a phone. Moving the map around can be a bit tedious with buttons, but is straightforward with practice.The altimeter, barometer and compass, plus maps of the whole of Europe mean you can go hiking just about anywhere. If you need maps for other regions you can buy them and upload them through Garmin Express.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar can run third-party apps downloaded from the Connect IQ store. There are plenty of small utilities and widgets, apps such as Uber and Strava, music services including Spotify, Deezer and Amazon Music, and buckets of watch faces.The Spotify app works well. It can download up to 2,000 songs for offline playback via wifi or control music on your smartphone. Not many smartwatches have offline Spotify playback, so having it for runs is a big plus for subscribers.Garmin Pay is also available for contactless payment on the go. It is not supported by many banks in the UK, but does support Curve, which allows you to bind most credit or debit cards to it. Payments are secured by pin and could be a lifesaver for use on public transport or buying a drink when running without a phone or credit card.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar has an RRP of £739.99 and comes in either 42 or 47mm sizes.The watch is also available without solar charging as the Fenix 6 Pro costing £599.99, with solar charging but without music, maps and wifi, as the Fenix 6 Solar costing £649.99 or in a larger 51mm version called the Fenix 6X Pro Solar costing £849.99.For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music costs £299.99, the Forerunner 945 costs £519.99, Suunto 9 Baro costs £539, the Coros Vertix costs $599 (£460), the Polar Vantage V Titan costs £519, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 costs £269 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is the do-anything, go-anywhere watch for those that need a smartwatch while stuck to a desk during the day, but then dump everything and go climb a mountain, do a triathlon or simply trek into the middle of nowhere at the weekends. Or aspire to do those things.It is very much the kitchen-sink of multi-sport watches, which means most of it is total overkill if you’re just a runner, just a cyclist, just a swimmer or just looking for a long-lasting smartwatch. But if you do more than one thing, or like the idea of being able to jump out of an aeroplane in the middle of Europe and still find your way home, this is the watch for you.It is really easy to live with and looks the part. A rugged, yet stylish sports watch that states to the outside world: “I do more than just the day job”. Those with smaller wrists will struggle with the 47mm version, but the 42mm version is smaller than many smartwatches.Garmin’s Power Glass offers a glimpse of the solar-powered future. It’s not quite the holy grail of a smartwatch you never have to charge, but made a small but material difference to the battery life. Having to charge it less than once a week is still a killer feature for everything this watch can track and do. It is worth noting you’re paying an extra £140 for the solar-charging technology versus the same watch without it, which is a fair sum.It is certainly not cheap, and definitely overkill for most. But if you want the ultimate outdoor adventure smartwatch, the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is it.Pros: tracks everything under the sun, long battery life, solar charging, phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPSCons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared to Apple WatchWear OSGalaxy Watch, no touchscreen, screen fairly basic compared to the best smartwatches"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb891d87ee93da5f979614c091b8cb2c7d21735/0_85_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d6218a0b8504da712a0991d4da109c","title":"google giving user data authorities documents reveal","story":"Exclusive: in some cases Google did not necessarily ban users who were often threatening violence or expressing extremist viewsA little-known investigative unit inside search giant Google regularly forwarded detailed personal information on the company’s users to members of a counter-terrorist fusion center in California’s Bay Area, according to leaked documents reviewed by the .But checking the documents against Google’s platforms reveals that in some cases Google did not necessarily ban the users they reported to the authorities, and some still have accounts on YouTube, Gmail and other services.The users were often threatening violence or otherwise expressing extremist views, often associated with the far right.The documents come from the so-called “Blueleaks” trove, which hackers acquired from the servers of a hosting company in Texas which had been used by several law enforcement agencies. It contains hundreds of thousands of documents from more than 200 agencies, dated between 1996 and June 2020.The leak has been authenticated by cybersecurity experts.The Google documents containing subscriber information are signed by the company’s CyberCrime Investigation Group (CIG). CIG has been mentioned in coverage of criminal proceedings based on their reports, but its raw output to law enforcement agencies has never been exposed to public view.In the Blueleaks trove, the documents are associated with the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, part of a nationwide network of fusion centers, which were created after 911 to facilitate information sharing between state, federal, local and tribal law enforcement agencies.Steven Renderos, executive director of MediaJustice, a nonprofit campaigning for a more just and participatory media wrote in an email: “In a moment of reckoning on the failure of police to keep people safe, it is reckless for Google to hand off private user information to law enforcement.”Renderos added: “While the prevalence of hateful activities across Google owned platforms is a real problem, deflecting responsibility to police is not the solution.”The Google documents retained by NCRIC highlight the activities of inidual users, providing detailed subscriber information, which often includes real names, street addresses, credit card numbers, Gmail and recovery email addresses, YouTube channel addresses and the time and IP addresses of recent logins.Many of the documents also include copies of comments users have made on Google services like YouTube.One user whose comments Google passed onto police appeared to threaten racist and terrorist violence.On a now-deleted video on the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton by Canadian white nationalist, Stefan Molyneux (whose channel YouTube has now banned), the user wrote: “Hi guys, i need your help, i cant help but look at those shooters and think, that could be me. I watch Stefan, and black pilled and many others on the right. I think i should do the same thing they are doing.”The user then went on to discuss methods of making explosive devices.But the same user also discussed making explosives in other comments which were still visible on YouTube at the time of reporting, along with the user’s account.On a video alleging acts of brutality by local police, the user appended comments urging others to “kill them, when you go to trial i wouldn’t find you guilty for shooting these criminals. Kill them all”.According to Google’s reports, the same user appended racial slurs to videos reporting crimes which Google has since removed.A second user who still has an account on the site made threats of racist and anti-police violence on a number of videos.On a video of an incident where police appear to run a woman down with their car in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the second user writes, “Thats vehicular homicide. Need to walk into his house inhis sleep amd shoot his children” (sic).On another video, a report from Russian outlet RT on the coronavirus, the same user writes: “I want the name of the Asian doctor that let the coronavirus outbreak happen. Im going to shoot his daughter in the face”.Google also reported three videos by a third user – who is identified by name, address, phone number, email address, IP address and alternate account – all of which remain on YouTube.The reports contain detailed descriptions of the three videos, including “At around 1:10, the words ‘Muskets would be glowing RED” appear on the screen. Assault weapons are visible in the background. At 3:28, subject asks: “Where is your line in the sand? When is enough, enough?’”, and “Video is titled ‘A Toast to the Few \u0026amp the BooGaLoo.’”While many of the comments appear to threaten other users, law enforcement, or Google employees, and many of the users appear to share far right extremist ideologies, many of those users and their comments remain on Google’s services.Other users are identified by more sophisticated methods, and while some are banned from YouTube, they appear to retain access to other Google services.One user was identified by matching two separate Gmail addresses to a single Android device, which yielded the user’s name, age, address and phone number.That user had posted YouTube comments making anti-Jewish comments, praising white supremacist terrorists, including mass killers, and suggesting he may emulate them.But the report indicates that the user still has two Gmail accounts.While many of the reports sent by Google feature violent or racist threats, some are more indicative of thoughts of suicide or self harm, or simply mental distress.Google did not immediately respond to detailed questions about its reporting system, user privacy and the company’s relationship to law enforcement.Mike Sena, the Executive Director of NCRIC, said in a telephone conversation that the Google reports came through a common reporting facility on the site’s front page that “the public, law enforcement, and any other organization” can use to pass information to the fusion center.Asked about how such reports are used, Sena said that any action from reliable reports “is usually in the form of a welfare check”, and that “our role is to find the best resources to help that person”.Sena said that reports that meet criteria like reliability “in triage” are stored for 12 months.But equality and privacy advocates were concerned about Google’s role in voluntarily passing on user data to law enforcement.Saira Hussein, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, said in a phone conversation that EFF was concerned about the “vast amounts of user data” Google appeared to be voluntarily passing on to law enforcement, but questioned Google’s goal in doing so.“Are they expecting law enforcement to do something, or is this just a way of covering themselves? Does Google see its responsibility as simply reporting this to law enforcement and moving on?” Hussein said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf431a6dec2bcb21859aa6355446f01e0013f14/0_0_6635_3981/master/6635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e79f4877e42d71c5da588057fddf453","title":"unspoiled beaches sand dunes great food summer in southern sicily","story":"In the island’s far south-east, locals are making the most of wide sands, buzzy baroque towns – and a lack of foreign touristsHas fear of coronavirus emptied the beaches – or have I chanced upon one of the last unspoiled stretches of coastline in Italy? I am on the sand at Santa Maria del Focallo in southern Sicily. Around me, a few clusters of friends and families are huddled under umbrellas or cooling off in the sea. Dunes coloured green and pink by evergreen shrubs and bougainvillea stretch in both directions: west towards the port town of Pozzallo and east towards Portopalo, Sicily’s most southerly tip, where the Ionian Sea meets the Mediterranean. There’s an end-of-season feel, as if the stragglers are soaking up the final rays of summer. In reality, the season has only just begun.On 4 June, the travel ban between regions in Italy was lifted and beach resorts began reopening, relying heavily on holidaymakers from their own region and hoping to make ends meet despite the new mask-wearing, socially distanced normal. In this particular corner of Sicily, however, finding space to sunbathe at a safe distance has evidently never been an issue. It has endless kilometres of beach free from the privately run lidos that clutter most Italian resorts, with their tightly packed, uniform rows of sunbeds and parasols.“It’s always like this,” says Ettore Lorenzi, a kitesurfing instructor, from the porch of his whitewashed wooden shack overlooking the beach.Ettore runs the Floripa Yoga and Kitesurf  House (doubles from €70) alongside yoga teacher Ameriga Giannone. Just over the road from the beach, it’s a modernist, low-key space, with bold-coloured walls and a lush garden. The vibe is more like a stay with friends than a hotel holiday. I’m barely been there five minutes before Ettore puts a tumbler of red wine in my hand and invites me to join the other guests – either old Sicilian friends or repeat visitors – at a long table on the jasmine-shaded terrazzo for a vegetarian dinner. I quickly realise I could happily spend the week flitting between the beach and the grounds of Floripa.But I have a large unspoiled region to explore and a long list of “unmissable” places to eat at along the coast. Gennaro del Pino, a not terribly busy beach barman, tells me: “Though excellent cooking can be found almost anywhere nearby, A Valata, on the seafront in Pozzallo, 8km away, is where pozzallesi locals choose to dine.” And so off I go.Unlike the beach, A Valata is rammed. Part-suspended on wooden decking, the restaurant hangs over now-obsolete concrete tracks that used to guide boats into the water. “The kitchen was formerly a boathouse,” the restaurant’s owner says. “It was one man’s job to row out across the bay to the lighthouse to top up the lamps with oil each night.” Now succulent platters of house speciality pesce crudo – Sicily’s answer to sashimi – fly out of the former boathouse kitchen. Michael La Pira, who works as a waiter in summer and in the merchant navy in winter, says the fish is brought in daily on small boats that have been the bedrock of this local economy for centuries.On the table next to me, a young woman finishes a huge portion of linguine with fresh tomatoes and sardines. “Tourism is surplus to fishing and agriculture here,” says Erika Modica, whose choice of dish reflects the two pillars of the area’s economy. Erika runs a boat chartering business, and appears unfazed by the impact of coronavirus. “We live very much in the present here,” she says. “We are happy people.”Indeed, as I walk back through the town to the car, a heady atmosphere prevails as locals pack the boardwalk enjoying their evening passeggiata. The only sign of a pandemic is the odd mask slung over an elbow, to be worn when entering a bar or shop. Holidays are still happening here, just without the influx of foreign tourists.In the opposite direction to Pozzallo, east along dusty roads flanked by polytunnels growing Pachino tomatoes, is Portopalo di Capo Passero. Once the centre of the tuna trade, and now on the verge of being run-down, it feels real, compared with touristy Marzamemi further up the coast. Not far away, off Italy’s southernmost tip, Isola delle Correnti is a tiny island just above sea level, with a 200-year-old octagonal stone lighthouse. It’s an ideal swimming spot, and groups of friends clutching lilos are wading out through the shallow water to swim in the small coves.Staying on shore and in the shade, I chat to a family on holiday from Emilia-Romagna, the first non-Sicilians I come across during my stay. “We were lucky to have booked our flights in January because now they are expensive,” says Sabrina Corbino, as she tucks into scaccia – a traditional layered pizza-pie filled with tomatoes and aubergine. She blames the airlines for the lack of tourists – including Italians – though she admits she already knew the area through having family here.Inland, the hilltop towns built in Sicilian baroque style offer a side helping of sophistication. I enjoy an aperitivo in the chic town of Noto, but nearby Modica and Scicli are equally beguiling. Noto’s architecture is high baroque, and the pale stone reflects the sun in ever-changing pink hues on the wide cobbled streets. In Cássaro Cafè-Bistrot on the main drag, two friends have a drink at the table next to mine. They are a fashion PR and a stylist who moved from Milan several years ago to transform an 18th-century apartment into a B\u0026ampB. “This is the type of place where you could be standing next to a famous film director in the queue for an ice-cream and no one would even realise,” says Edoardo Marchiori as he sips his margarita. “Those in the know come here to get away from the crowds.”Back at Floripa, the other guests are baffled by my decision to skip the daily yoga classes, but with such a seductive and unpretentious corner of Sicily on the doorstep, yoga is going to have to wait.• Car rental was provided by Avis (from €200 per week)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2555792d63ee852b6bd9e655317d1f57f56e4f4/0_0_5626_3378/master/5626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2686575bb686dbab23e97dacab0b1a6f","title":"louis dejoy usps postmaster general election","story":"Since taking office in June, DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling USPS, leading to delays in mail delivery – and fears mail-in ballots won’t arrive on timeAbout a month ago, a United States Postal Service (USPS) mail carrier named Mark arrived at his post office in central Pennsylvania and got some shocking news from his station manager. Mark and his coworkers were told they would have to depart the office for deliveries a few hours earlier each day, even if that meant leaving behind much of the day’s mail.In the weeks that followed, higher-ups at the station instructed carriers to abandon hundreds of pieces of mail in order to depart a mere 10 or 20 minutes earlier. As the days went on, the excess mail started to pile up, and now Mark estimates there are thousands of undelivered letters and packages sitting in his station.“The supervisors are cracking the whip, making sure we leave,” Mark told the . “Meanwhile carriers are walking by and saying, ‘Look at all this fucking mail we’re walking past, it’s just sitting there.’”When Mark and his coworkers confronted the station manager he said he was only following orders from the new USPS postmaster general, Louis DeJoy. Since taking office in June, DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling US Postal Service, shaking up agency leadership and rolling out policies that have led to delays in mail delivery. These changes, which DeJoy has said are designed to cut down on labor costs, have angered advocates and Democratic politicians, who have accused him of trying to tamper with the election just weeks before millions of Americans start casting their ballots through the mail.Now, the controversial logistics executive and Trump mega-donor arguably has more power than any other official in the country to affect the outcome of this year’s presidential election.Donald Trump has maintained a public obsession with the USPS, which he has called “a joke”. In particular he has fulminated against the agency’s business relationship with Amazon: despite studies showing that the USPS makes a profit by shipping packages for the e-commerce giant, Trump has repeatedly insisted that the agency should charge Amazon higher rates.To stanch the bleeding, congressional Democrats have proposed giving the agency up to $25bn in aid money as part of their second coronavirus relief package, but Trump on Thursday again came out against that proposal on the grounds that it would help the USPS handle mail-in ballots, which he wrongfully believes would lead to voter fraud.Without an aid package, the USPS has faced unprecedented challenges with staffing and scheduling due to the impact of the coronavirus on its already stretched thin workforce. Customers in more than a dozen states have reported delays of days or even weeks in mail delivery, including for essentials like prescription medicine. And a number of recent primary elections have been marred by postal failures: numerous voters in Wisconsin and Michigan never received absentee ballots they requested weeks in advance, while New York postal workers inadvertently disqualified thousands of ballot envelopes for not having proper postmarks.Amid this turmoil, DeJoy’s appointment represents the culmination of a years-long attempt by the Trump administration to gain control over the USPS: earlier this year the president also filled two vacancies on the agency’s board of governors with agency outsiders, giving him complete control over the regulatory body.DeJoy is only the fifth postmaster general in history to come from the private sector. He has never worked for the USPS, but he benefited as CEO of New Breed Logistics from a long business relationship with the agency. In the late 1980s the shipping company signed an equipment contract with the USPS and over the next 20 years the agency became one of the company’s biggest customers alongside private companies such as Sony and Estee Lauder. A North Carolina newspaper later referred to the USPS contract as the New Breed’s “big break”.But DeJoy’s tenure at New Breed was marked by controversy: the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the company’s interactions with its workers were “motivated by anti-union animus”, and the company paid out more than $1.7m in fines for labor law violations between 2001 and 2015, according to the Intercept. In early 2000, DeJoy’s younger brother, Dominick, sued Louis and a third brother, Michael, accusing them of defrauding him out of a one-third stake in the company, according to a news article at the time.As he grew his logistics empire, DeJoy also made a name for himself as a prolific Republican fundraiser, hosting lavish dinners out of his home in Greensboro, a $5m mansion compound. Former president George W Bush held a $1,000-a-plate event at the home in 2006 ahead of that year’s midterm elections, while former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin held another closed-door event at the home two years later.DeJoy, meanwhile, is not the only member of his family to enter politics: his wife, Aldona Wos, served as ambassador to Estonia under Bush and later headed the North Carolina department of health and human services, where she faced criticism for hiring a number of Republican campaign aides and former New Breed employees. In 2014, the USDA discovered a pattern of shoddy bookkeeping and an enormous backlog in the state’s database of food stamp recipients in her agency. This year, Trump nominated Wos to serve as the US ambassador to Canada.It took about 30 years, but leading New Breed eventually paid off. In 2014, he sold the company to logistics conglomerate XPO for a reported $615m, and became CEO of XPO. When DeJoy retired in 2015, he told local newspapers he was spending some time at his beach house, eating meals with his two children, and “actually reading” his Wall Street Journal. He also launched a holding company, LDJ Strategies, that he planned to use to deploy his money in real estate and private equity investments.According to financial disclosures obtained by CNN, DeJoy still maintains a large stake in XPO Logistics, and owns large amounts of Amazon stock, creating two glaring conflicts of interest for a man leading a government agency that competes with both companies in some areas. Outside ethics experts called the disclosures “shocking”.But DeJoy’s principal activity during his short retirement turned out to be kicking up fundraising efforts for the GOP, especially Donald Trump. Beginning around 2016, DeJoy donated more than $1.2m to pro-Trump Pacss, making him one of the president’s largest single donors. He hosted a $15,000-a-seat fundraiser for Trump at his home in late 2017, noting in the invitation that while “the president and his team have had some missteps … it is hard to deny the extreme and unreasonable challenges he faces from the political establishment”.Last year the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, named DeJoy chairman of fundraising for the Republican national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he hosted Mike Pence to kick off his money-raising efforts. In an interview ahead of the event, DeJoy said he planned to raise around $70 million using a strategy of “nationwide begging”.The RNC last month decided to scale down the Charlotte convention due to concerns about the coronavirus, but DeJoy’s ample fundraising for the event paid off, nonetheless, in the form of his appointment to the position of postmaster general.In his short tenure at USPS, DeJoy has already orchestrated risky changes to the agency. In interviews with the , postal workers said DeJoy’s new policies have introduced further confusion to an agency already hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. They worried the inconsistent and sporadic changes could cause serious harm to people and businesses and prevent the agency from ensuring every ballot is counted in the upcoming election.Sasha, a mail carrier in Massachusetts, said USPS leadership has slashed hours for the clerks who sort the mail. This has resulted in a backlog of multiple days for residual mail including heavier packages from Amazon and other delivery services, a delay that has already affected a small-business owner along his route.“This kind of delay of service is voter suppression, plain and simple,” Sasha said. “Not a single person in my station of around 50 employees believes this is anything other than active sabotage, and that includes supporters of the president.”Another carrier in rural North Carolina said his station has started to receive each day’s mail from the sorting plant a few hours earlier than usual. According to the carrier, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, this change almost certainly means that some letters and packages are being left at the plant each day, cutting off some of his most remote customers from supplies or medicine.These issues mirror backlogs that are accumulating around the country: even small post offices are reporting backlogs of up to 10,000 mailpieces, while some postal union officials have also reported that senior leadership are taking away their mail sorting equipment.DeJoy has also enrolled about 400 post offices in a pilot program that prohibits postal clerks from hand-sorting the morning’s mail before letter carriers leave the station to deliver it. Any letters that were not automatically sorted by the station’s machinery are simply left at the station and delivered on some future day, if the carriers get around to it. The union that represents letter carriers has filed a national-level grievance against the program, saying the program unduly restricts carriers’ ability to get the mail out.In response to a request for comment, a USPS spokesperson referred the  to a set of remarks DeJoy released last week in which he said he was “vigorously focusing on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations” and promised to “aggressively monitor and quickly address service issues”.But for employees like Mark, the postal carrier in Pennsylvania, whose station is taking part in the pilot program, the changes have only led to the massive mail buildup and weeks-long delays. He said he now doubts that the USPS can ensure accuracy in the upcoming election, especially in his home state, which Trump carried by about 40,000 votes in the 2016 election.“If you asked me a month ago can the postal service handle an influx of mail-in ballots, I would have said, ‘We’ve been through two world wars and a depression, we’ve been doing this for more than 200 years,’” he said.“Now, I’m not so sure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd12065be18b5bed28c82fba0d398b12eede523c/75_552_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c42c8f856212d8321d48f640b87c819","title":"global report alarm over covid case rates 19 european countries","story":"Countries cross threshold for cumulative 14-day totals, with Spain particularly worrying Nineteen European countries have crossed a key threshold of new coronavirus infections, with Spain’s figures particularly worrying.According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the countries have recorded cumulative 14-day infection totals higher than 20 per 100,000 inhabitants, considered an early alarm level by many health experts.Luxembourg and Spain have reported more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, the figures show, with Malta recording more than 80, Belgium more than 60, and France and the Netherlands more than 40. The UK has 20.7.Spain reported on Monday a total of 1,833 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing its seven-day total to 32,329. The daily figure provided by the health ministry was lower than Friday’s post-lockdown record of 2,987, but infection statistics in many European countries often dip on Mondays due to diagnosis and reporting delays on Sunday.Four more Spanish regions imposed new laws intended to curb the spread of the virus, including closing nightclubs and obliging bars and restaurants to shut by 1am, joining two that began applying the measures – which also include limits on visits to retirement homes – on Sunday.The northern Basque region on Monday declared a health emergency, allowing it to impose even tougher restrictions because of the risk of what authorities described as a “tsunami” of infections.In total, 59,162 cases have been detected across Spain in the past two weeks, leading public health experts to warn the country is in a critical moment in its battle against the virus.Last week nine scientific organisations published a joint letter warning that the recent surge in cases could risk a “collapse” of the country’s healthcare system. “If the situation continues and new measures are not adopted, there is a high probability that we will again face the situation seen during the state of alarm,” it noted.Health officials have played down these fears, pointing to the fact that the majority of cases being detected are among people under 65 years old. As a result, they said, the number of deaths remained relatively low at 54 in the past week.In Germany, which announced a comparatively low 561 new cases on Monday, the health minister said large gatherings and celebrations were the main source of new cases.Weddings would be under threat if numbers continued to rise, Jens Spahn said, adding that while returning holidaymakers accounted for many new cases, domestic outbreaks were just as significant. Big parties could “spread the virus very, very fast”, he said.In France, where Monday’s new infections figure was 493, also well down on the 3,000-plus reported on the two previous days, a government spokesman said riot police would be dispatched to Marseille, which along with the greater Paris area was this weekend classed as a Covid-19 “red zone” to ensure stricter rules on mask-wearing and social distancing were observed.The Île-de-France region around the French capital also announced tougher measures in care homes, including mandatory tests for all new care home workers and residents as well as those returning from holiday.The French public health agency described the situation as “preoccupying”, adding that “all indicators continue to progress and the transmission of the virus is accelerating”. It said all age groups were affected but most particularly young adults, and most infections were taking place outside of recognised clusters.A historical theme park, the Puy du Fou, drew a storm of protest on social media after the local prefecture allowed it to organise an event attended by 9,000 people, far exceeding a government limit on gatherings of more than 5,000.Opposition politicians and workers in France’s otherwise stricken arts sector said the park’s owner, a former conservative cabinet minister and friend of President Emmanuel Macron, had benefited from special favour. The culture minister, Roselyne Bachelot, denied this, saying the park had followed distancing requirements.The Czech Republic, which has so far reported about 20,000 cases in total and 397 deaths, said face masks would be compulsory again from 1 September on public transport and in many indoor public venues because of a resurgence of infections.The country was among the first in Europe to order people to wear masks in most public places in March, but lifted the requirement when infections fell.“We consider this to be a preventative measure given that we are probably facing a complicated autumn, especially after 1 September when there will be high social interaction,” the health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee83c99d70e6f54a5898fb0e395a3b94b9f95ae/0_8_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3574f0b8d7562abda0552bd790efe3e5","title":"israel and uae open phone link after historic deal","story":"Connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the agreement made last week to establish diplomatic ties A telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel has begun working as the two countries opened diplomatic ties, part of a deal brokered by the US that required Israel to suspend its contentious plan to annex the West Bank.UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in what Israel hailed as an important step.Congratulating the UAE on “removing the blocks”, Israeli communications minister Yoaz Handel issued a statement on Sunday saying: “Many economic opportunities will open now, and these trust-building steps are an important step toward advancing states’ interests.”Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and mobile phones registered to Israel’s country code +972 from around 1.15pm.Also on Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, such as the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would typically play prior to Sunday saying calls to +972 numbers could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, although these too were often interrupted.Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phones with +970 numbers, which those in the UAE could call.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in the US-brokered accord.The historic deal delivered a foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians say it puts a just resolution of the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach by undermining an Arab consensus that recognition of Israel only come in return for concessions in peace talks. That removes a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.The agreement will make the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full, active diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE and Israel announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between the two countries were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Early on Sunday, the Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency announced a UAE company had signed an agreement with an Israeli company for research and study of the coronavirus pandemic.The move has sparked anger among some who see it as a betrayal of longstanding efforts to establish an independent state of Palestinians. In Pakistan, hundreds of Islamists rallied on Sunday to denounce the Emirati-Israeli deal. The Jamaat-e-Islami party chanted slogans against the US and burned effigies of Trump. They also set ablaze American and Israeli flags.The deal also has enraged Iran and Turkey, regional rivals of the UAE.On Sunday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces called the UAE’s decision a “disaster”. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri urged Abu Dhabi to “revise” its position.“If an incident happens in the Persian Gulf and violates the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, even a tiny bit, and we see it from the UAE, we will not tolerate it,” Bagheri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa6babae6b7a87fb56d9a528bfdaaa9f692652f/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ac1450f0b3233739816e820a2b952f","title":"covid 19 climbdowns the uk governments u turns and missteps","story":"Claims of ‘world-beating’ response tarnished by reversals on everything from testing to A-level resultsThe list of U-turns carried out by Boris Johnson’s government in its response to Covid-19 continues to grow. After apparent failures on the contact tracing app, a change of heart on school meals and school opening dates, A-level results becomes the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of its missteps so far:After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August.The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google.Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer.Prof Neil Ferguson, who was advising the government at the time lockdown was imposed, gave damning testimony that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll could have been halved if the government had introduced the measure a week earlier. Johnson insisted it was premature to make judgments about the government’s approach.The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however,  Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September.Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions.A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers.In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before.A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering.The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when  Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c8f3171d1871a2f7c2d62fb9aa03340e3624030/0_151_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54647824790f9179dba25386906e0ea9","title":"coronavirus live news new zealand postpones election italy closes nightclubs","story":"Turkey’s total number of coronavirus cases rose to more than 250,000, with 1,233 new cases identified in the past 24 hours, health ministry data showed on Monday, as the death toll neared 6,000.The data showed 22 people had died in the past 24 hours in Turkey, bringing the death toll to 5,996, while the total number of recoveries rose to 231,971.Reuters reports that France recorded a further 493 Covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours on Monday, sharply down from a caseload of above 3,000 each on the two previous days, but hospitalisations for the respiratory disease rose for a third day in a row.New case figures published on Mondays have consistently been lower than weekend tallies since the start of the outbreak as fewer coronavirus tests are conducted on Sundays, so the dip in infections does not necessarily signal a change of trend.The seven-day moving average of new infections, which smoothes out reporting irregularities, stood at 2,322, above the 2,000 threshold for the fourth day in a row – a sequence unseen since 20 April, when France was in the midst of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus.France’s cumulative total of infections has reached 219,029.With infections increasing anew, French authorities are scrambling to avoid a second, economically damaging nationwide lockdown. The government is set to propose on Tuesday that masks be worn in shared indoor workspaces while Paris and Marseille, France’s two biggest cities again declared “red zones” of infection, have expanded areas where mask-wearing is mandatory.Since the beginning of August, Covid-19 cases have increased by 1,830 on an average daily basis, a figure two-and-a-half times higher than July’s average, and also higher than the 1,678 figure in March, when the spread of the virus was accelerating.After consistent declines since a 14 April peak of 32,292, the number of people hospitalised for the disease rose by 65 to 4,925, after a rise of 3 on Sunday and 29 on Saturday. And the number of people treated in intensive care units (ICU) has increased by 17 over the last three days to 384.That ICU figure reached a peak of 7,148 on 8 April, when the French health system was on the brink of breakdown.Coronavirus-related deaths were up by 19 on Monday to 30,429, after an increase of four over the weekend.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said the number of deaths due to coronavirus had risen by 654 to 169,350 and reported 5,382,125 cases. That is an increase of 41,893 cases from its previous count.The CDC reported its tally of cases of Covid-19 as of 4pm ET on 16 August versus its previous report released on Sunday.The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by inidual states.Here’s a summary of the day’s developments so far.That’s all from me. My colleague Lucy Campbell will be taking over shortly.As part of a series of profiles of those who have died in Australia from Covid-19, Matilda Boseley profiles Vicky Patsakos, who moved to Australia from Greece with her young family in the 1970s:“She used to put her hand on your head and say ‘everything is going to be OK’,” says Helen. “She would look you in the eyes and tell you ‘don’t worry about a thing’... she was robbed, she was robbed of time with us. And we were robbed too.”You can read more about Vicky here.Airlines and airports will ask a UN-led task force meeting on Tuesday to recommend countries accept a negative Covid-19 test within 48 hours of travel as an alternative to quarantines that have decimated demand for travel, according to a document seen by Reuters.The industry wants the task force to make the recommendation for passengers travelling from countries with high Covid-19 infection rates when it meets on Tuesday to review guidelines for international travel amid the pandemic.The push for testing comes as the industry’s hopes for a recovery were dealt a blow last week when Britain reintroduced quarantines on travellers from France and the Netherlands.“We don’t support across-the-board mandatory testing,” IATA medical adviser Dr David Powell told Reuters. “But if there are situations where there is a higher risk in the country of origin and it can avoid the need for quarantine, then we certainly support that and advocate for that concept.”The proposal calls for the use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests conducted outside of airports.The task force did not raise testing as an alternative to quarantines in May when it recommended a uniform approach toward reviving flights, but it could do so after Tuesday’s meeting.The International Civil Aviation Organization was not immediately available to comment.Powell said the 48-hour period recommended by IATA and ACI was up for discussion and said it could make sense for some travellers to take a second test upon arrival at their destination.While task force recommendations are voluntary, ICAO guidelines are typically adopted by its 193-member countries.Requiring testing raises cost issues for travellers, given airlines are unlikely to bear the approximate $200 expense. The sector faces up to $314 billion in lost revenue in 2020, according to ICAO forecasts.Spain has detected more than 16,000 new cases of the coronavirus since Friday, according to new data from the country’s health ministry, adding to a tally that already ranks as the highest in western Europe.In total, 59,162 cases have been detected across Spain in the past two weeks, leading public health experts to warn that the country is in a critical moment in its ongoing battle against the virus.Others have warned that the rapid growth of cases could see a return to the dark days of March and April that left Spain with one of the highest excess death tolls in Europe.Last week, nine scientific organisations published a joint letter warning that the recent surge in cases could risk a collapse of the country’s health care system. “If the situation continues and new measures are not adopted, there is a high probability that we will again face the situation seen during the state of alarm,” it noted.Health officials have played down these fears, pointing to the fact that the majority of new cases being detected are among people under 65 years old. As a result the number of deaths remain relatively low, with 54 lives claimed by the virus in the past week, according to data from the health ministry. Some two months after the country eased out of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, authorities have announced a raft of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, from closing all bars and restaurants at 1am to a ban on smoking in public places when social distancing is not possible. More from Lebanon’s acting health minister Hamad Hassan, who notes that pressure put on the healthcare system by the blast in Beirut last week makes pressure on hospitals all the greater:“Public and private hospitals in the capital in particular have a very limited capacity, whether in terms of beds in intensive care units or respirators. We are on the brink, we don’t have the luxury to take our time.”In Sweden, a freedom of information request has uncovered controversial emails sent by the country’s chief epidemiologist in which he appeared to ask whether a higher infection rate among older people might be acceptable if it led to faster herd immunity.Tegnell has repeatedly insisted the government’s objective was not aimed at achieving rapid herd immunity but rather at slowing the spread of the coronavirus enough for health services to be able to cope.You can read Jon Henley’s story here:Lebanon must shut down for two weeks after a surge in coronavirus infections, the caretaker health minister said on Monday, as the country reels from the massive Beirut port blast.The country’s health ministry registered a record 456 new infections, with two deaths, taking the cumulative number of cases to 9,337 since February, with 105 fatalities.“We declare today a state of general alert and we need a brave decision to close (the country) for two weeks,” Hamad Hassan told Voice of Lebanon radio. Lebanon, already deep in financial crisis, was struggling with a Covid-19 spike before the huge 4 August explosion, which killed at least 178 people, wrecked swathes of the capital and pushed the government to resign.The warehouse blast damaged many hospitals and overwhelmed them with more than 6,000 wounded. It put about half of 55 medical centres across Beirut out of service, the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week.“We are all facing a real challenge and the numbers that were recorded in the last period are shocking,” Hassan said. “The matter requires decisive measures.” Intensive care beds at state and private hospitals were now full, he added.In comments to Reuters, Hassan said authorities would not close the country’s airport for the moment, with the rise in infections stemming mostly from within the country.“The real danger is the spread within society,” he said. “Everyone must be on high alert and take the strictest prevention measures.”The WHO warned that the risk of the virus spreading had grown in the country since the blast, with nearly a quarter of a million people being uprooted.In France, 493 new infections were reported on Monday, sharply down from more than 3,000 new infections on each of the previous two days. The number of hospitalisations for the disease rose by 65 to 4,925, increasing for the third day running.Reuters reports that the Spanish health ministry on Monday announced 1,833 new coronavirus infections diagnosed in the past 24 hours, below Friday’s post-lockdown record of 2,987 but more than three times the average seen in July.Daily infection statistics tend to dip on Monday due to fewer diagnoses taking place on Sunday.Cumulative cases, which include results from antibody tests on patients who may have already recovered, rose to 359,082, with 32,389 detected in the past seven days, the ministry said.Since lifting its strict lockdown at the end of June, Spain has struggled to contain a spiralling infection rate, despite mandatory mask-wearing enforced across the country and other restrictions.The government’s most senior coronavirus expert, Fernando Simon, said more testing was part of the reason for the surge.Madrid, Catalonia and the Basque Country have all launched mass screening programmes in a bid to identify and isolate asymptomatic carriers of the virus.While hospitals are not yet under severe pressure, Simon said some medical staff were beginning to feel the strain, particularly in Madrid, which has detected 9,430 cases in the past seven days, more than any other region.Despite widespread fears that an influx of summer tourists would serve as a vector for infection, Simon said only 163 imported cases had been confirmed in the past week.The ministry is monitoring 1,019 active clusters of the virus, defined as three or more linked cases spread across different households, up from 560 at the beginning of the month. In Brazil, AP reports, a group of indigenous protesters is blocking a major road to demand better protection from coronavirus:Dozens of Indigenous people, many daubed in black paint representing their grief and fighting spirit, blocked a major highway in Brazil’s Amazon on Monday to pressure the government for help in protecting them from Covid-19.The Kayapo Mekragnotire people blame authorities for the deaths of four of their elders and infections of dozens more on their land in southern Para state, near the city of Novo Progresso. Leaders said people from outside their territory spread the new coronavirus among them because there were no restrictions on entry to their land.About 400 Kayapos Mekragnotire people live in 15 separate groups in the region. They said they have few doctors, scarce personal protective equipment and no nearby intensive care unit beds for Covid-19 patients.“Healthcare here is precarious. There are not enough health care workers to handle the situation. We need urgent support in the middle of the pandemic,” said Doto Takak-Ire, a Kayapo Mekragnotire leader. “We need more personal hygiene supplies, more masks. If the government had done its job, we wouldn’t be here in the middle of the pandemic.”They said they will keep their logs and tyres spread across the road until federal authorities come to negotiate.Brazil’s health ministry says the virus has infected nearly 20,000 indigenous people and killed at least 338. Experts believe both figures are largely underestimated. A count by non-profit group APIB, based on official stats and information from leaders, says more than 25,000 Indigenous people have been infected nationwide and 678 killed by the virus.Tens of thousands of Brazilians are confirmed to have died nationwide from the virus, and the actual number is believed to be higher.Bei Kayapo, an indigenous leader, said the deaths of the four elders were especially hard. “They are our history, our museums. They have all the stories of our people,” he said.In the UK, the government has performed a juddering u-turn to say that this summer’s exam results will be based on teacher assessment rather than a controversial standardisation model that prompted fury from students who found themselves sharply downgraded on the basis of their schools’ previous performance.My colleagues Richard Adams and Sally Weale have a write-up here ...... and you can follow our UK liveblog for more on this breaking story here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0958b753c954b9e27597842d13716e3f9bc0782d/0_487_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7e73ff232da16b050f3f700d1a99fd","title":"this is our future how eight talented young creatives found their voice","story":"Full of ideas and uncompromising about the world they want to live in, eight exceptional iniduals have come together to have their say, their way“It’s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,” says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects.

I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think.

I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up.

Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireA- and AS-level students who received a final mark lower than that predicted by their teachers are to have their grades reinstated, the North’s Minister for Education has announced. The significant shift in policy by DUP Minister Peter Weir followed a similar U-turn over this year’s GCSE grades in the North earlier on Monday.A- and AS-level students will now be awarded either the grades predicted for them by their school or college, or the official grade they were awarded by the exam board last week, based on whichever is the highest. GCSE results – which are released on Thursday – will be based only on the predicted grades supplied by teachers. There has been widespread controversy over this year’s exam results in the North, with students, parents, teachers and politicians complaining of a statistical “anomaly” that has downgraded marks at A and AS levels. According to the exam board, the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA), 37 per cent of estimated A- and AS-level grades were lowered during the standardisation process. Monday’s decision on students’ marks is in keeping with similar announcements in England and Wales. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Monday afternoon, Mr Weir said his “prime concern” was to “ensure that the young people in Northern Ireland are in no way disadvantaged compared to their peers elsewhere. Approximately one-fifth of second-level students in the North receive qualifications from English and Welsh exam boards. “We couldn’t in Northern Ireland go on some level of solo run in relation to this, because that would have meant then there would have been disadvantage and disparity between students within Northern Ireland,” Mr Weir said. Mr Weir, who until Monday afternoon had defended the A- and AS-level grades awarded to students last week, rejected the suggestion that he had bowed to political pressure on the issue, saying there was “no perfect solution” to replacing exams cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the overriding concern had been to ensure that “as much as possible we’re fair to everybody”. He said the CCEA was working to release the revised A- and AS-level results to candidates as quickly as possible. ‘Fantastic news’“This is fantastic news,” said Michael Allen, the principal of Lisneal College in Derry. “We asked you to listen and you did. A good day for Northern Ireland.” The president of the National Association of Head Teachers, Geri Cameron, said the move was the “only sensible and just thing” the Minister could have decided, and it was “extremely good news for students, parents, teachers and head teachers, whose lives have been on hold for the last few days”. The SDLP’s education spokesman, the West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan, welcomed the announcement as “a win for our teachers and their professional judgment, but most importantly, a win for our young people”.He called on the Minister to offer a “full and genuine apology” to students for the distress caused, and to teachers “for the way their professional judgment was cast aside”, and said the algorithm used to work out the grades awarded last week should be made public so “lessons are learnt from this debacle”.Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan said the move was “the right decision and was the only sensible response to the problems which were evident last week”, but added that the Minister “should have taken the action earlier and on the merits of the arguments rather than waiting on the approach of ministers in London”.Mr Weir’s announcement came amid a similar U-turn by the British government, which announced on Monday afternoon that A-level results in England were to be revised and based solely on teachers’ assessments. The controversy over this year’s exam grades is to be debated by MLAs at Stormont on Tuesday, after all parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed a motion to recall the North’s Assembly from summer recess.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

About 28,000 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will receive no benefit from tomorrow, after failing to confirm their continued eligibility for the scheme, the Department of Social Protection has said.The number of people claiming the payment fell to 232,400 this week, a decrease of 61 per cent from the peak of 598,000 in early May. The scheme, which provides €350 per week for most recipients, was introduced in March to aid those who lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.In recent weeks, the department had contacted around 390,000 PUP claimants asking them to confirm their continuing eligibility for the payment.At the beginning of last week, about 29,000 had not confirmed their continued eligibility “despite having received personal notifications on four separate occasions” up to August 9th, the department said.By Friday, August 14th, about 1,000 confirmed their eligibility for the PUP, and they will continue to receive their payment. The remaining 28,000 will not receive a payment as their PUP claim is now deemed closed. However, anybody who is eligible but did not confirm their eligibility by the deadline can have their payment restored by re-applying online.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys, said the payment continues to be a “vital source of income” for thousands of iniduals and families.“Our resources are not unlimited and we need to ensure that this money goes to the people and families who genuinely need it,” Minister Humphreys said.“My Department has made every effort to contact every person receiving the payment in recent weeks in order to confirm their continued eligibility. The vast, vast majority of people responded and will continue to receive their payment as normal.”On Monday, the Department of Social Protection issued payments valued at €72.2m to 232,400 people for the PUP, representing a decrease of 30,100 on the 262,500 people paid last week.The top three sectors in which employees are returning to work this week are accommodation and food services wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles and construction.The largest cohort returning to work is in the under 25 age group, the department said.Of those receiving the PUP this week, 61,750 will receive the lower rate of €203, based on their pre-pandemic earnings being below €200, while the majority (170,650) will continue to receive the higher rate of €350.

File Photograph Nick BradshawJourneys by rail and bus are 57 per cent lower than pre Covid-19 levels, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). However, the volume of cars on roads is close to returning to pre-pandemic levels. The volume of cars for the week ending August 8th were just 12.6 per cent lower than 2019 levels at regional levels and 16.3 per cent lower in Dublin. The volume of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) measured at selected sites in Dublin since June 21st, 2020 exceeds that measured for the same period last year. The CSO said the pace of recovery of road traffic volumes for cars and HGVs to pre Covid-19 levels continues to outstrip that of public transport passenger numbers. It added that the impact of restrictions on rail journeys was more significant than that on journeys by bus or Luas. Meanwhile, the number of new private cars licensed in the first seven months of 2020 fell by more than 31,000 compared to the same period in 2019. CSO statistician Olive Loughnane said the pandemic has had a “significant influence” on traffic volumes, the number of journeys on public transport and travel through Irish airports.“The number of passenger journeys on public transport has dropped dramatically since the start of the Covid-19 crisis with journeys by rail most severely hit,” she said. “Public transport volumes are recovering at a much slower rate than road traffic.

Democrats say this is a political effort to interfere in the election. Photograph: DEPAMichael ReynoldsWhat is the controversy surrounding the US postal system?The United States Postal Service – one of the oldest institutions in the United States, one first headed by Benjamin Franklin – is in the midst of a cash and logistics crisis.The organisation – which hasn’t broken even since 2006 – is seeking a $25 billion emergency injection of funding as part of the latest coronavirus stimulus package being discussed by Congress. The White House has so far opposed this cash injection, arguing that the organisation needs to modernise.What is the connection with November’s election?The crisis has coincided with increased attacks by the president, Donald Trump, on postal voting. In recent weeks he has claimed that the practice will lead to a “rigged election” and that the US will be a global “laughing stock”. Last week he explicitly linked his efforts to reduce funding to the USPS to an effort to curb mail-in voting. “If we don’t make a deal, that means they don’t get the money. That means they can’t have universal mail-in voting, they just can’t have it,” he said of the postal service.Why is Trump making this argument?Trump has tried to sow doubt about the integrity of the US electoral system for years. Following his 2016 election win, he tweeted: “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”In particular he singled out California, claiming that “millions and millions” of people voted illegally. He repeated that claim on Monday on Fox News, suggesting that California is sending ballots to “everyone and their dogs” and to people who have been dead for 25 years.Is there any evidence to suggest that mail-in voting is less reliable than regular in-person voting?Past research says no. A study by Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt found 31 instances of voter fraud between 2000 and 2014 in a total of one billion votes. A report by the justice department under then president George W Bush came to similar conclusions.Trump established a commission to investigate voter fraud, but it was soon abandoned – while the White House blamed states for not handing over voter data, many suspected that it had simply found insufficient evidence.However, there have been isolated instances of voting fraud – most recently in Paterson, New Jersey. A high profile case in North Carolina in 2018 found that Republican officials had improperly collected tampered-with ballots.There is no evidence to suggest that postal voting favours Democrats over Republicans.The bigger issue in the US is the fact that many of those eligible to vote do not participate in the electoral system.Is the American postal system ready for the expected rise in mail-in voting?The US postal service warned states this month that it may not be able to confirm the delivery of mail-in ballots by the required timetable. In reality, provision for mail-in voting differs widely across the country.Some states like Colorado and Washington have offered the vote-by-mail option to registered voters for years. Others have been slow to develop a mail-in voting system and may lack the infrastructure to cope with an increase in postal ballots.Problems plagued New York’s primaries in June. More than 10 times the usual number of absentee votes were received – whereby a voter requests permission to vote remotely if they are unable to vote in person on election day – and final results were not announced for weeks.Problems in the voting system are not just confined to postal voting – voters in Georgia’s primary were forced to queue for more than five hours to cast their vote. Many said they had not received absentee ballots they requested.What are Democrats saying?Nancy Pelosi has recalled the House of Representatives to vote on legislation to block changes at the postal service, which Democrats believe will stymie voter participation in November’s election.Louis De Joy, a Republican donor and former logistics executive who was appointed by the president to lead the postal service, has introduced several changes, including reducing overtime hours, and in some cases removing mail sorting equipment, according to unions. Democrats say this is a political effort to interfere in the election. De Joy argues that he is improving efficiency.What are Republicans saying?Trump strongly backed De Joy, following protests outside his home in Washington DC at the weekend. Trump says he supports absentee voting but opposes sending mail-in ballots to everyone automatically.New Jersey became the latest state to announce last week that it would send postal ballots to all registered voters, giving people the option to vote by mail or in person.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332096.1597667396!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"highest global temperature in 100 years recorded in california","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe hottest temperature ever recorded was at California’s Death Valley in 1913.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"democratic convention four things watch joe bidens big week","story":"The Democrats on Monday start their four-day convention that will see Joe Biden formally adopted as the party’s presidential nominee and praised by a string of grandees. To preview a week of political pageantry I took over The ’s weekly politics podcast, Chopper’s Politics, to look at the challenges facing Mr Biden at the convention and beyond. It features polling expert Larry Sabato breaking down the state of the race with less than three months to go and former Hillary Clinton political director Amanda Renteria discussing what happens when conventions go wrong. Moe Vela, a man who was by Mr Biden’s side as his director of administration on day one of the Obama presidency, also shares his insights about Mr Biden the person and politician. You can listen to the full podcast above. Spinning off from those discussions, here are four things to watch for at this year’s Democratic National Convention. This year there will be no arena packed with tens of thousands of cheering supporters, no ticker tape and balloons falling down onto the anointed presidential nominee. Thanks to coronavirus the convention will be almost entirely virtual, a made-for-television spectacle that will see delegates tuning in remotely and speeches made to camera.The core of the convention will be two hours of broadcasts on Monday to Thursday, programmed to catch the prime time TV audiences from 9pm to 11pm on US eastern time. Some strategists believe that by ditching the archaic full-day schedules of conventions of old and focussing on engaging films and short speeches voters may actually be more engaged. The start of the year seems like a lifetime ago in today\u0027s US news cycle but the first three months of 2020 saw a bruising set of primaries as candidates tussled for the presidential nomination which laid bare a party split.The race dynamics soon settled into a leading light on the party’s Left, Bernie Sanders, squaring off against the flag carrier for the moderates, Mr Biden, the former US vice president. Since Mr Biden pulled into an unassailable delegate lead in the spring lots has been going on behind the scenes to make sure progressives fall in line and vote for Mr Biden. Mr Sanders takes to the stage on Monday and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old congresswoman and left-wing icon, speaks Tuesday. How fully will they embrace the centrist Mr Biden? Or will the splits still be on show? The polls, for whatever they are worth, make for dire reading for Donald Trump right now. Behind in national polls. Behind in the swing states. Viewed poorly on his handling of the pandemic.But consistently when Americans are asked in surveys who they trust more to lead the country out of this economic slump Mr Trump comes out on top against Mr Biden. One of their big messages the Biden camp will be trying to land over the convention is that Mr Trump’s mismanagement of the pandemic equals mismanagement of the economy.They are seeking to pin the blame for the staggering economic drop-off - more than 55 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since Covid-19 struck the US - on the Trump administration’s failings. The Democrats are all too aware that Mr Biden is facing ruthless attacks from the Trump campaign about his age, 77, and whether his mental acuity is not what it once was.An endless stream of clips of Mr Biden tripping over his words is being pumped out by his opponents online, alongside nudge-nudge comments about his mental sharpness. The convention and his acceptance speech on Thursday is a chance for Mr Biden to bury the ‘Sleepy Joe’ image being pushed by Mr Trump and project strength in office. An energetic, free-flowing address at a moment when more voters than usual are tuning in would help undercut the Trump camp narrative ahead of the November 3 election. You can listen to The \u0027s weekly political podcast, Chopper\u0027s Politics, on the audio player above or subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your preferred podcast app.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italy shuts nightclubs coronavirus cases rise among young","story":"Italy has ordered the closure of all nightclubs and discos amid growing concerns that young people are catching and spreading the coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 35,000 Italians.It was the first re-imposition of restrictions since Italy’s strict national lockdown began easing in May.The decision comes as the number of new cases increases, rising from an average of around 300 a day last month to as high as 600 a day this month.On Saturday, 629 new cases were reported - the first time there had been more than 600 daily cases since May - while on Sunday there were 479 cases. On Monday, the number of new cases dropped to 320.There are fears that unless urgent action is taken, Italy could be heading back to the darkest days of March and April, the height of the pandemic.A big increase in infections could jeopardise the planned reopening of Italy’s schools on September 14.Millions of parents are counting on the reopening of schools, which have been closed since early March.As well as shutting down discos and nightclubs, it is now compulsory to wear a facemask where large numbers of people gather, for instance outside bars and pubs, between 6pm and 6am.The nightclub sector, worth €4 billion a year and employing around 50,000 people, was furious over the decision.But the government said it was unavoidable, with many young people contracting Covid-19 and the average age of patients falling to below 40. The new regulations begin today and will last until early September.“We cannot nullify the sacrifices made in past months. Our priority must be that of opening schools in September, in full safety, Roberto Speranza, the health minister, wrote on Facebook. He said there was a danger that young people could infect their parents and grandparents.Health experts said it was vital not to squander all the sacrifices that Italians made during lockdown.“Either we all follow the rules or we risk having to close other activities,” said Franco Locatelli, the president of the Higher Health Council and a member of the government’s Covid-19 advisory panel.The closure of nightclubs was an urgent necessity, he added. “It will have an economic impact, unfortunately, but public health must come before everything else,” said Prof Locatelli.“For now, luckily, Italy is still in a privileged position, even though the number of cases has risen from 200-300 a day to more than 600 at the weekend. We’re in a better position than France and Spain but there is the risk of an exponential growth in the curve in the next two weeks.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rumblings revolution belarus should worry vladimir putin","story":"There can be few world leaders more worried than Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin right now – although Alexander Lukashenko, of Belarus, is one of the few as he is likely to lose his job, and maybe even his freedom, in the days or weeks to come.But for the Russian president, the uncomfortably familiar-looking proto-revolution on the streets of Minsk presents a dilemma.The very worst outcome for Mr Putin (which, incidentally, is the best one for the people of Belarus) is that Mr Lukashenko is swept from power and replaced by a broadly pro-Western leader – or at least one who espouses democracy.That would mean that another neighbouring country slips from what Mr Putin considers should be his rightful grasp, following Georgia and Ukraine. Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova have also undergone quasi-revolutions, although they have followed a less obviously pro-Western path.The seemingly obvious course for Russia, then, would be to attempt to repeat the success of 2014 and intervene. Back then, Mr Putin lopped off one part of Ukraine (Crimea) and has been destabilising parts of its east ever since with catastrophic effects – over 13,000 dead.But Belarus is not so simple, and Mr Putin must know it.Although he is doubtless egged on by some close advisers and parts of the Russian press, he also knows that an intervention, as well as costing money and blood, would also be deeply unpopular in both countries.The Belarussian people are not anti-Russian. However, Russian troops – not known for their sensitivity – on the streets of Minsk and elsewhere would engender the same kind of sentiment that most Ukrainians and Georgians now feel toward Russia.This is why Ukraine and Georgia were not really success stories for Russia at all. It may have gained some soil and infamy, but Russia destroyed any hope of a good neighbourly relationship, not least because that was not its intention.The Kremlin wanted a more of an overlord and underling dynamic, but failed to understand human nature in the process.The regathering of Russian lands gave Mr Putin a steroid boost at home back in 2014. But that would not be the case with Belarus. That trick has a law of diminishing returns. While Belarus\u0027s revolution is unlikely to trigger the same in Russia itself, the thought of it must be in the back of Mr Putin\u0027s mind, if not the front.Mr Putin has never been less popular at home than he is now. Quite apart from the anti-Kremlin protests over the past year of his fifth term, there have, over the past week, been street demonstrations in Russia in support of the Belarusian people\u0027s will.Like Mr Lukashenko, Mr Putin has to resort to increasingly brazen methods to retain his grip on power. But the more blatant the abuse, the more likely (and the more fervent) the popular response.So Mr Putin has a problem. Intervene and it will not go so well for him this time. Leave it alone and the nightmare scenario of a converted and uncontrolled Belarus takes shape.In reality, leaving it alone is not in the Kremlin\u0027s nature. The military option is by no means impossible in this tumult, but a more likely halfway house is for Russia to scale up its non-military involvement.It already feeds Belarus a lifeline of subsidised energy. This will play a part over the next few months. But there will also be a mixture of coercion and ingratiation with Belarus\u0027s new power figures.With several more leaders in post-Soviet countries now moving into 15 or 20-plus year rules (to say nothing of Mr Putin himself, some year 21 years and counting), the pattern of the so-called colour revolutions is set to continue.This is the inevitable consequence of the disappointment of post-Soviet rule and Russia\u0027s still-Soviet mindset.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"waitrose becomes second supermarket ditch bag life","story":"The bag for life backlash has grown as Waitrose became the second supermarket to announce a trial to phase them out.Morrisons announced on Monday that it plans to remove them and replace them with paper carriers, after research suggested that many customers only use them once.The sturdier, thicker versions are more expensive than single-use plastic bags and are supposed to be better for the environment as they will last for longer. But environmental campaigners have pointed out that they use more plastic so could have a greater impact if frequently thrown away.Waitrose said it is planning its own trial before the end of the year with the potential to remove 40 million bags a year when it is extended across all of its stores. A spokesman said it was too soon to give further details.Environmental experts have said that reusable cotton bags or a rucksack are the best option for shoppers, amid concerns that even compostable alternatives could cause confusion.Although many bags are marked as “compostable” this does not always mean they will break down at home as the conditions may not be correct, said Nina Schrank, a plastics campaigner at Greenpeace UK.She added that clearer labelling is needed to make sure that consumers understand how to dispose of them.Friends of the Earth’s plastic campaigner Julian Kirby said that compostable bags can create “an unwelcome new headache” for waste managers.He added: “Ultimately we need to shift away from single-use packaging – whatever the material – and focus instead on reusable products and packaging.”Several British supermarkets said they offer home-compostable carrier bags.Ms Schrank added that paper bags should be treated as a last resort option, as they still require vast quantities of energy to produce.She said: “Our single-use, throwaway society has caused an environmental catastrophe on a global scale.

They include Australia, Japan, the Philippines and India.  The coronavirus pandemic has forced the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) event, hosted by the US Pacific Fleet, to scale down from 25 to 11 nations, about 20 ships and 5,300 personnel, and its drills, which will now only be conducted at sea, have been whittled down from the usual five weeks to two. However, the exercises have riled Beijing, which was not invited to participate, despite taking part in 2014 and 2016. China was disinvited in 2018 by the Trump administration which accused it of militarising disputed areas of the South China Sea. Chinese state media has lashed out at the US in the run up to RIMPAC. The Global Times in particular has issued several barbed commentaries on Washington’s attempts to flex its military muscle and “strongarm” allies to join the exercise. “The US can test its partners in the RIMPAC But when it comes to a real battlefield, will the US still be able to assemble that many allies?” it asked last week. On Monday, the state-run paper chided the US for ignoring a petition by Hawaiian citizens to call off the event over coronavirus fears. China, however, in recent weeks has stepped up its own show of force in the Indo-Pacific region, carrying out drills both in the South China Sea and in waters near Taiwan, an island democracy and US ally that Beijing claims as its own and seeks to annex. On Sunday, the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong released footage of a live-fire drill in the South China, firing cannons and torpedoes and carrying out anti-submarine training, in what military analysts said was a warning to Taiwan. The footage emerged a day after the US navy said a strike group led by the USS Ronald Reagan had conducted maritime air defence operations.Indo-Pacific experts have warned the region is heading towards a dangerous juncture. Writing in the Lawfare Blog, Kurt Campbell, former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and the Pacific and Ali Wyne of the Atlantic Council, said deteriorating ties between the US and China, in part fuelled by the pandemic, made current dynamics “even more conducive to inadvertent escalation.”Dr William Choong, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told The  that “you can’t orce China and RIMPAC from the broader tensions in the Sino-US relationship.”He added that in the bigger picture “it looks like the Chinese are getting increasingly impatient, although I think that it’s an action reaction cycle that you see between the Americans and the Chinese – you can’t really ascertain who started this in a sense.”Ultimately the situation was “worrying,” he said, as unlike during earlier regional clashes, “the balance of power has quite significantly shifted towards the Chinese side, in terms of the capabilities that the Chinese are able to bring to the table, which are significantly larger.”Meanwhile, the US and South Korea will also begin their annual joint military exercises this week.Despite a low key programme due to the pandemic, mainly involving computer-simulated war scenarios, the drills beginning on Tuesday may still irk North Korea, which views the allies’ training as invasion rehearsals. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/17/09/ruth-jones-james-corden.jpg","title":"gavin and stacey james corden ruth jones christmas special proposal","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.2019 Christmas special was most watched TV episode of the last decadeRuth Jones has promised that she will write with Gavin \u0026amp Stacey co-creator James Corden again in the future.The pair wrote and starred in the hit BBC Three sitcom together from 2007 to 2010, which returned for a one-off special in 2019.In the years since, Jones has continued acting and working as an author, while Corden moved to the US to present The Late Late Show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpeaking to The Sunday , Jones admitted that she and Corden had talked on Zoom a few times in lockdown, but “didn’t do any writing” as they both felt “uncreative”.She continued: “Since then we’ve not even mentioned work, just talked about the family and how we’re feeling.

Among other mysteries, that would help solve the question of how it was able to power itself through such distant space, since pure hydrogen gas would have been able to push it like a rocket.That explanation was useful to the scientists who have spent years puzzled by Oumuamua, after it was first spotted travelling nearly 200,000mph through our solar system in 2017. It sped up as it went on its journey, without any clear explanation, and seemed to behave somewhere between an asteroid and a comet, though it didn\u0027t fit either category and it remains mysterious where it has come from.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut a new paper from researchers at Harvard and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) suggest that such an object would not actually have been able to survive the long journey.If it were true, the hydrogen ice theory about Oumuamua would be a major breakthrough in understanding the object. It would explain why it was so strangely shaped – like a long cigar – as well as the non-gravitational acceleration as it sped up on its journey.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rockWe were suspicious that hydrogen icebergs could not survive the journey – which is likely to take hundreds of millions of years – because they evaporate too quickly, and as to whether they could form in molecular clouds, said Avi Loeb, Frank B. Baird Professor of Science at Harvard and a co-author on the paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.Among other problems with the theory, the researchers suggested that an iceberg of this kind could not be formed through the usual processes that create solid objects of this kind – sticky dust colliding with each other and gradually accruing into a larger object. That would not work with a hydrogen iceberg, the researchers say.“An accepted route to form a km-sized object is first to form grains of micron-size, then such grains grow by sticky collisions,” said Thiem Hoang, senior researcher in the theoretical astrophysics group at KASI and lead author on the paper. “However, in regions with high gas density, collisional heating by gas collisions can rapidly sublimate the hydrogen mantle on the grains, preventing them from growing further.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Organisations including the Country Land and Business Association, Thames Water, National Trust, and the RSPB are in the working party.Created with Sketch.Prints for Wildlife: Top animal snappers campaign for conservation Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Not all of the groups back the proposals submitted to Defra, but the Beaver Trust said all agreed collaboration was key to restoring and managing England’s rivers.Some, including farmers, fear beavers will damage land and fish stocks, and that dams can exacerbate flooding rather than preventing it.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The force said the organiser of the wedding was fined under lockdown legislation.“We understand that the vast majority of people across Greater Manchester are doing the right thing and it’s incredibly disappointing that these people are being continuously let down by a small minority, who are selfishly flouting the very guidance that is there to keep us safe,” said Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling.Manchester police vow to get tough on lockdown breakersGMP said they had received 54 reports of potential breaches of lockdown on Sunday afternoon and evening alone, including several house parties as well as the wedding reception.“We’ve been really open with the public about the pressure these calls place on already stretched and limited resources and I really need people to understand what is at stake here.“Can you imagine a vulnerable loved one not being able to get through to 999 when in an emergency, because our phone lines are tied up with people reporting illegal parties? It’s this serious.”There are, however, signs Greater Manchester’s local lockdown is working.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stephen Bush, writing in the New Statesman, said: #The row is a case study in how not to use algorithms in public policy: because an algorithm is a process, not an event.#An algorithm is a way you process information – not something you can use to create new information from thin air. #If you have no actual data, you have what bankers call the “garbage in, garbage out” problem.#If you have rubbish or non-existent data, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated the spreadsheet you run it through is – you can’t make the resulting numbers make sense.#The Government must “step up” and support universities now facing further challenges created by its U-turn on the way A-level results are awarded, a leading education body has said.Universities UK chief executive Alistair Jarvis has called for “urgent clarication” from the Government and advice on a number of “crucial issues” following its policy change on Monday.He warned that while  per cent of students were placed with their first-choice institution, those who are not should “think carefully about their next steps” and seek advice from their preferred university.Mr Jarvis said: “Today’s policy change will mean that more students will have the grades that match the offer of their first-choice university.“This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process – capacity, staffing, placements and facilities – particularly with the social distance measures in place.“Universities will do everything they can to work through these issues in the days ahead.“The Government will need to step up and support universities through the challenges created by this late policy change.

A spokesman for UCAS said: #For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately.  #Speak with your parents, s and teachers and then your first conversation will need to be to your firmchoice university. UCAS said once universities have the new marks they will be able to make decisions as to which students get a spot. But there is no clarity on what happens to students who have already confirmed places at universities that were not their second choice. Ultimately, it will be up to universities to decide whether to offer places to kids they turned down after their initial results were released.The spokesman said: “We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”A-level student Nina Bunting Mitchem said at the news of the sudden policy change: #I am so happy for my future, my peers in my colege, everybody  affected.#Everyone has been heard, finally.#The fact I was given a prediction of ABB means I will have those grades and be able to become a vet.#I couldnt be happier, I really couldnt.#Ex-UCAS chief Mary Curnock Cook has said the Government U-turn is a #sad and happy mess#.

This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.# She said the Government needs to look at lting the cap on university students. Often universities will make more offers to students eventhey dont have the places # because not every pupil will make the marks required to take up the spot.

For all of that, we are extremely sorry.#The Government was forced into a screeching U-turn on exam results and A-level, AS level and GCSE students will be given the marks predicted by their teachers over the bungled computer-standardised gradethe predictions are higher. It comes after hours of crisis talks between ministers and exam regulator Ofqual. The PM interrupted his Scottish getaway with baby Wilfred and partner Carrie to talk to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Anger at Mr Williamson hit fever-pitch today, days after A-levels were released last Thursday. Dozens of Tory MPs demanded kids, who had their hard-earned marks stripped away by a #classist# algorithm, be allowed to use the teacher assessment.

The Government is set to make announcement about students in England this afternoon. At the moment we dont know what to expect from todays exam announcement.But some are saying that it could be a total u-turn.The Times reported that grades will be changed to match teachers predictions. This comes just days after Gavin Williamson told The Times in an interview on Saturday that there would be #no u-turn# and #no change# to the system.Its only a few hours before well find outthis is correct.If so, it means the UK Government will follow Scotland and Northern Ireland in completely ripping up their systems and reverting to teacher grades, which Ofqual says are inflated.The next problem with this would be that universities have already started rejecting pupils based on their old exam results.UCAS and the whole system may need to start again to fully take this move into account.Or thousands of kids will have their exam grades changed but still not get into the uni or onto the apprenticeship that they wanted. https:twitter RosieDBennett status  We also know that the PM broke off from his holiday in Scotland today to take an urgent call with Gavin Williamson and senior officials.

We had to take that decision due to coronavirus.#Whips have told Tory MPs there will be an announcement on the A-level and GCSE grades chaos this afternoon. Almost  Tory MPs have raised concerns about the way grades were handed out. Head of  committee Sir Graham Brady has called for the release of GCSE results to be delayed. He told The Times: #The flawed process for arriving at A-level grades has caused massive concern and needs to be corrected. #It would be sensible to defer GCSE results until everyone can have greater confidence#. Defence minister Johnny Mercer has written a letter to young people in his constituency, saying: #You can imagine my views, which I have made very clear within Gov. #I do not believe this is the end of the story # there are too many clear injustices. At this time we must not panic, and await developments. #I am limited in what I can say publicly.# Childrens Commisioner Anne Longfield has condemned the standardisation algorithm as #irredeemably flawed#. She said: #It is not in children’s interests for weeks of appeals and arguments among adults to continue. #Nor is it in the interest of schools, which should be focusing on their final preparations for reopening safely to all students in September.#Ms Longfield demanded GCSE students are given centre assessment grades rather than using Ofquals system. She added that it was too late to put the #genie back in the bottle# for A-level students, but that school leavers should #at the very least# have teacher-assessed grades shown alongside the Ofqual grades.

They explained Epstein would have daily massages, which victims have since explained were just a guise for sexual abuse.Cathy and Miles became increasingly concerned about the number of young looking girls coming and going from the island, many parading around topless or naked when Epstein was in residence.Cathy explained they were suspicious but didnt have any proof of wrongdoing - and claim never to have seen any of the sex parties described by victims.Miles said: I took the view that what went on behind closed doors was not my business and it is not my place to judge. If anything was going on we didn’t want to know.He added they also turned down some requests by Epstein to smuggle guests onto the island by boat, but Maxwell allegedly told them what Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.The couple quit in  after Epstein was arrested in Florida the previous year - later being sentenced to  months in jail for solicitation of prostitution.The couple also claimed during their very first visit to the island during an interview they had to leave due to a VIP guest arriving, later being told that it was also Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew is claimed to have first met Andrew in  after being introduced to him by Maxwell, who he knew from her time in the UK.Little Saint James is the centre of many claims about Epsteins revolving door of young girls who Maxwell and others are alleged to have procured for him to abuse.Andrew strongly denies any allegations against him and said he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing while friends with Maxwell and Epstein.The Duke of York is accused of sleeping with Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts at Maxwells townhouse in London in March  when she was just .The infamous picture allegedly showing Andrew, Ghislaine and Virginia together was taken on the same night.Andrew has said he has no memory of the photo being taken - and has suggested it could be a fake.She also claims to have had sex with Andrew at Epsteins mansion in New York and on his private island of Little Saint James.Andrew has admitted visiting the island once, but former staff and victims have claimed they saw him there on multiple occasions. Maxwell has been accused of taking part in the grooming and abuse of dozens of underage girls by Epstein.She is currently in prison awaiting her day in court after being arrested by the FBI in July and strongly denies all allegations.The current charges against her relate to allegations by three alleged victims in particular.She has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers have accused the victims of trying to turn her into a scapegoat since the death of Epstein.Epstein killed himself in his cell at a New York prison in August last year while awaiting trial on charges - depriving many victims of justice.Victims allege they were duped with claims she was recruiting models of masseurs - only to them be abused by the Epstein and Maxwell.Cathy and Miles claim that Maxwell bragged to them she was the queen bee and the one in charge - describing her as being very friendly, but rather arrogant.

There must have been  at least.“Jeffrey would say, Dont forget you are being watched at all times.”Epstein has long been claimed to have kept photographs and videos of the powerful and famous friends who visited him at his properties.He is alleged to have used covert CCTV coverage to get dirt on visitors to his properties - such as at his New York mansion and his home in Palm Beach.Epstein is also alleged to have bragged people owe me favors - and believed a cache of blackmail content he had accrued would allow him to escape prosecution. Victims have even claimed Epstein had a security room in his New York home which monitored everything - including the toilets and bedrooms.Mr Gita said Epstein always wore a “unorm” of Hard or Yale university sweatshirts when he arrived to massage him - despite not going to either school.The healer said: “He always had this smirk on his face, like he was the smartest guy in the room.”But he added: “I just thought he was weird.”Dad-of-two Mr Gita insists he was never aware of any underage girls at Epsteins properties.And he said Epstein “would be dead”he’d had any inkling he was abusing kids.He also revealed his regret that he introduced Chauntae Davies to the vile pervert – who says he went on to traffic her as a sex slave.Davies claimed in Netflix documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich that the pervert millionaire had a lot of information on people, and a lot of blackmail videos.Her revelations followed claims made last year by Maria Farmer, who alleges she was abused by the disgraced pedo when she was a -year-old aspiring model in .She said that guests were secretly filmed in every bedroom and toilet of his New York City home.While appearing on CBS This Morning, Maria said that Epsteins plush home was under constant surveillance and showed off his media room.Maria saw how scores of covert cameras enabled him to see what was going on in toilets and bedrooms.She added: I was like I’m never going to use the restroom here and I am never going to sleep here.A Palm Beach Post article reported cops found hidden cameras in two rooms as Epsteins home in Florida - including inside a clock on his desk.Epsteins alleged madam Maxwell is currently in prison awaiting her day in court over her links to the sex trafficking scheme.Last year, alleged she claimed that Epstein would film guests on his private island Little Saint James.Vanity Fair reported that the child abuser was likely “videotaping everyone on the island as an insurance policy, as blackmail.”.And in , Epstein told a New York Times journalist that he had dirt on an “astonishing number” of celebrities and powerful people.He told writer James B.

The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible - and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks.After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.There was no easy solution to the problem of awarding exam results when no exams have taken place. Ofqual was asked by the Secretary of State to develop a system for awarding calculated grades, which maintained standards and ensured that grades were awarded broadly in line with previous years. Our goal has always been to protect the trust that the public rightly has in educational qualications.But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence. Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone  affected by this issue.GCSE students are set to receive their results on August  - despite them missing exam season.Results day will not be delayed despite fears it would be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ex-Soviet strongman leader however refused to bow to widespread protests and said there will be no new elections following the disputed vote on August . We held elections already. Until you kill me, there will be no other elections, he said.Lukashenko - who has ruled Belarus for  years - faced heckles of step down during the speech at a state-run industrial plant as he pledged to put changes in the constitution to a referendum.The flimsy olive branch is unlikely to satisfy protesters and the opposition who have already seen one vote allegedly rigged against them.He said: Yes, I’m not a saint. You know my harsh side. I’m not eternal. Butyou drag down the first president you’ll drag down neighbouring countries and all the rest.Hundreds of thousands have hit the streets, state workers have gone on strike, , people have been detained, and the internet has been cut off by the regime.Lukashenko has mocked the violence carried out by his security forces, saying it was justied as protesters attacked police.

It is latest in a growing dossier of cover-up allegations to be fired at China as the nation comes under scrutiny for its actions in the early days of the pandemic.China has been accused of attempting to downplay the virus as it spread out from the city of Wuhan.It has now infected almost million people and killed nearly ,.Beijing has always denied any improper behaviour over its handling of the pandemic, saying it was open and transparent over the virus.Mr Potter said the mismatched data was revealed after a string of passwords linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virologywere leaed online.Hackers were able to get inside the institutions systems and some of the data from WIV was sent to Mr Potter and Professor Balding for analysis. He said: When we anaylsed that, it was a bit of a mismatch of data against what they’d been publicly putting out there to the World health Organisation.Mr Potter explained much of the database of , entries appeared to have been deleted before a certain date and day to day case numbers were skewed. He said: Once the story became quite a bit contentious, and when the Chinese Communist Party realised that the coronavirus was going to become a global pandemic, they went about purging the data.Meanwhile, Professor Balding, from Fulbright University Vietnam said the database is likely an example of Chinese government officials censoring upwards to please their bosses. He explained: It appears to have been censored upwards, so ithad been censored internally many times before they released the data.This seems to indicate they have some kind of internal targets they want to hit to try and show progress.This seems to imply they were fudging their own numbers for their own purposes as well as external purposes.Mr Potter admitted it is going to take some time to fully understand what data missing and by how much it was altered.He said a team are now working to drag out the real numbers from the depths of the purged database.China has so far recorded , cases and , deaths - with the figures being just a fraction of those being seen in countries like the US and UK.WIV has come under scrutiny during the pandemic as a potential source of the outbreak as it was known to be studying bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-.The scientic consensus is that the virus originated naturally - potentially from a wet market in Wuhan where it jumped from animals to humans.Questions remain however with figures such as US President Donald Trump demanding answers from China and suggesting there could be more to the origin of the pandemic.

Delaying a year wont be an option, and it shouldnt be an option. For many it will mean falling out of education.Ms Mordaunt added: I have also made my views on GCSE results known to DfE. Will be posting updates later today.And defence minister Johnny Mercer said today he was concerned for GCSE results on Thursday, adding there were injustices taking place with regards to exams.He wrote on Facebook: As someone who spends so much time in the schools and colleges in my constituency, and someone who strives endlessly to improve opportunities for young people from Plymouth, you can imagine my views, which I have made very clear within Government.He hinted that the Government were about to back down in the face of uproar, adding: I do not believe this is the end of the story - there are too many clear injustices. At this time we must not panic, and await developments. I am limited in what I can say publicly - I have had many private conversations. Tory former minister Steve Brine said the Government needs to make a radical announcement on exam results today.Speaking to the BBCs World at One, he said: I think that the announcement this afternoon needs to be, and will be, radical.Tory former minister Stephen Hammond called the whole thing a shambles.He called for Ofqual to get the appeals process sorted by the end of the day so pupils can find out what they need to do as soon as possible.Mr Hammond, the MP for Wimbledon, told Sky News: These young people are not an exam board number, they are real people who deserve fairness and a chance to have their futures put in a solid position very quickly.And he suggested that delaying GCSE results day probably is the right thing to do.Tory peer and ex education secretary Lord Baker lashed the “flawed” algorithm used to dish out results.He said: “If you are in a hole, stop digging.I urge the Education Secretary to instruct Ofqual not to release the GCSE results this Thursday as their algorithm is flawed. The A-level results have produced hundreds of thousands of unfair and barely explicable downgrades.”Robert Syms told Times Radio this morning: We watched Scotland and the SNP get into trouble, and they sort of got into a bit of a hole.

And weve just climbed into the same hole, but were not getting out of it were still digging at the moment.He added that he would be happy for GCSE students to be awarded their teacher-assessed grades and that most Conservative MPs would be.His own son had his grades marked down, he revealed.There is real risk of Tory MPs going on the warpath, he warned.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the algorithm-awarded A-level grades should be abandoned, with teacher assessments or mocks used instead.No algorithm is going to sort our problem out, its a human issue, he told LBC Radio.The idea that you have an algorithm to figure out what they might have done in an exam is really impossible and I think thats where the big mistakes will be made.Tory MP Sir Oliver Heald, a former minister, has called for the Government to take action to recty results where pupils feel an injustice has been done.In a statement, the North East Hertfordshire MP said: It seems that the Ofqual algorithm is a blunt instrument and has adversely affected schools and colleges with large sixth forms.I am pressing the Government to urgently make changes to the system and am also advising all students to work with their schools and colleges on appeals where they feel an injustice has been done.Veteran Tory Sir Edward Leigh has written to Education Minister Nick Gibb about the clear injustice faced by some A-level students.The Gainsborough MP said: I am concerned that some hardworking pupils have been downgraded because this years results are based on last years.He said he had asked Mr Gibb to reconsider the Governments approach and allow teachers assessments to be used when there is clear injustice.One Tory MP told The Sun the crisis is “not quite a poll tax moment” but is making the government “look incompetent”.Anne Longfield, the childrens commissioner also came out today to urge change.She said: “Having looked at the evidence, it seems clear to me that GCSE results this year should be based on centre assessment grades - not the algorithm developed by Ofqual.”Yesterday, Ofqual published its guidelines for how to appeal - but swtly took them down after it emerged they contradicted the Governments own policy on which grade could be used.As of this morning they still havent republished the guidance, and kids are left in the dark about how to get their marks changed.No Government ministers have been on the radio or TV today to explain the position as critics rounded on Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.Former Ofsted boss Sir Micheal Wilshaw says the shambles is a terrible situation and a farce.He told the BBC Radio  programme: Ofqual have got to work much more closely with Government. Its completely wrong that the Gov, DFE and Ofqual are not singing from the same hymn sheet, especially on appeals.Ofqual have got to get their act together and be much more visible.Just days before pupils are meant to get their results, politicians in Northern Ireland announced they would ditch the computer model for GCSEs, after the huge fallout from A-level results last week.Peter Weir, the education minister, said the decision would not delay the results and that there wasnt enough data about GCSEs in order to use the computer model.He said today: These are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly dficult decisions are made.I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.I want to encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education or training post- and to know they have another opportunity to engage with education.I am also mindful that unlike A-level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process.I have, therefore, acted now in advance of the publication of GCSE results to ease anxieties, reassure young people and their families and ensure that every inidual candidate receives a grade that recognises the work they have done.Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is to write to Englands exams regulator to initiate legal action over the A-level results process.He tweeted on Monday: So it looks like the Government ARE digging in and standing by their deeply flawed system.In that case, I will be taking legal advice this morning and have instructed leading Counsel. I expect to be writing to Ofqual later today to initiate action.Scorned students have mounted a flood of legal challenges against their botched A Level grades too.Curtis Parfitt-Ford told the BBC today: We are confident that what this algorithm is doing is grading schools and not students.Which we think goes outside of Ofquals statutory remit.We are confident we have a strong case. We hope we wont have to take it to court, butwe do, we are ready to do so.They have also raised £, through crowdfunding to help with the case.And Labour big beast and ex-Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”The Department for Education has insisted that results had to be moderated to stop grade inflation going off the scale.A Downing Street source insisted the PM does still have confidence in Mr Williamson.It comes as some Ofqual board members reportedly want controversial algorithm results overturned and replaced with predicted grades, the  reported.Sources said some members of the Ofqual board believe the algorithm has caused a haemorrhaging of public opinion on qualications.The board members reportedly want to U-turn and use teachers predicted grades for students, as happened in Scotland.Using the predicted grades instead of the algorithm is reportedly seen as the least bad option.We are in a position where it is politically unacceptable to continue with the algorithm - this is the view of some people on the Ofqual board, a source told the .Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, told BBC Breakfast that, according to a study by the organisation, the algorithm has failed.He said: Weve just done a study and we looked at , entries, which is almost half of all the A-level entries in sixth-form colleges, across  A-level subjects - every single A-level subject.In every single one of those , entries in  A-level subjects, they came out lower than the previous three-year average. So the algorithm has failed.Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Academy Trust, has called for GCSE results to be postponed.Mr Chalke told the BBC:: I think there should be a delay. I think there should be an apology for the A-levels, a humble apology, and I think that there should be a delay around the GCSEs because it is better to reflect on what has happened, for Ofqual and for the Government to reflect and then respond having consulted with people outside of their own systems, with senior educationalists, rather than react and then regret, and then withdraw and then put a plan forward etc.After reflection, it may be decided it is the best possible answer that were left with, but lets not make all the same mistakes over the GCSEs.Grammar school headteacher Kay Mountfield said schools like hers have seen % of their student cohort downgraded.The head of Sir William Borlases Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, told BBC Radio s Today programme that most of their kids had their grades marked down.She said:Only  students out of  have kept their grades. Eighteen were downgraded by three grades,  by two grades and theyre scrabbling about for university places that just arent there.Seventy of my students have not had their first choice of university - normally that would be about five, or  maybe, students. But I have  grammar school students, from a range of backgrounds, who have worked very hard for their grades, struggling to get into universities.A Department for Education spokesperson said last night: “Hundreds of thousands of students have received a calculated grade that will enable them progress to the next stage of their education or into work.“We have been clear that we want to build as much fairness into the appeals process as possible to help young people in the most dficult cases and have been working with Ofqual to achieve that.Ofqual continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No U-turn, no change.”He said this evening that it became clear to him that more needed to be done over the weekend.Mr Williamson also said he would rip up the cap on university places - and urged them to take as many as possible.He added: They wont be fined and were removing those caps on every single university in the United Kingdom, so that they have the ability to expand the number of places, welcoming more students into those universities, as many as possible.It came after:Roger Taylor, Chair of the exams regulator Ofqual said in a grovelling apology: The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible - and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks.After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.He admitted the change in the system had caused real anguish and damaged public confidence.And the burden had been placed on teachers - who needed to get ready for the start of the new term rather than worry about sending off thousands of appeals.He stressed: For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.A-level student Nina Bunting Mitcham, from Peterborough said at the news: I am so happy for my future, my peers in my college, everybody  affected.Everyone has been heard, finally. The fact I was given a prediction of ABB means I will have those grades and be able to become a vet.I couldnt be happier, I really couldnt.She had got CDD before todays news.Of the chaos around the u-turn she said of the Government: They have really embarrassed themselves, but they have been able to turn it around, to show they do have a heart.They do have some realisation of what they have done, and they have listened for once.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted as soon as the move was confirmed:The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion.This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week.However, the Tories handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.Incompetence has become this Governments watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes.Boris Johnsons failure to lead is holding Britain back.Its not clear yet exactly what will happen now with university and apprenticeship applications.Mr Williamsons decision to rip up the cap means many more thousands can go to university -the place wants to offer them one.But many may not be able to get a place, and may be askedthey can defer for a year.Admissions service UCAS said they were working with universities, colleges and schools to support students to understand their options.They said universities would get the teacher grades and could make their own decisions - giving hope to thousands who may have given up hope on their preferred place.They added: “For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately. Speak with your parents, s and teachers and then your first conversation will need to be to your firmchoice university.Once your university has your ‘Centre Assessed Grades ’ via exam bodies they can make a decision as to whether there is a place at your preferred choice.“We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”University College London has said they will accept all pupils given an offer, but are still working out how this will apply to courses such as medicine - which had a cap on numbers based on practical constraints.The London university said: UCL’s priority is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, recognising that they have worked hard during unprecedented circumstances and deserve their first choice university.We are delighted to accept all students who meet the terms of their original offer on all programmes that do not have an externally-determined cap .For those students who have met our offer to study medicine based on teacher-assessed grades but do not yet have a place confirmed, we are working with the relevant agencies about places this year and we will guarantee a deferred place for next year.Opposition MPs said the change came too little too late.Wera Hobhouse tweeted: While this u-turn is welcome, it comes too late for many students who have missed out on course places. The Government has shattered young peoples hopes and plans. @GavinWilliamson and @BorisJohnson - how will you make this right Some universities have said they will take kids predicted grades regardless of the changes anyway.But others are sticking with the computer marks and have said they are already full up.Its not clear whether students who have a spot at their second place can refuse it, and get their first choice place again.Mary Curnock Cook, formerly UCAS chief executive, told the BBC kids could have to take gap years because there simply isnt enough places at universities now.She said today: There are literally tens of thousands of students who decisions have already been made about who they accept and dont accept.This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.I think we must expect from the Government very soon that the cap on university students should be lted. Many have filled their places rightly and now they are being asked to take in potentially tens of thousands of people moved back to their centre assessed grades.There will be some courses that are just physically full and may have to offer deferrals.Tory MPs are set to have meetings with ministers to explain the sweeping changes.Churchills grandson and former Tory MP Sir Nicolas Soames branded Mr Williamson a complete inadequate.And Tory George Freeman MP tweeted at todays news: This #ExamResults shambles has been hugely damaging to trust in the @educationgovuk @DowningStreet:When it was obvious.Defence minister Johnny Mercer and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt were two serving members of the Government to speak out ahead of the massive u-turn.Dozens of backbenchers and former ministers soon joined in too, forcing the Government to act.Students have been left furious and devastated after algorithms marked their grades down - as they were unable to take exams due to the coronavirus crisis.The PM has confidence in the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the head of exams regulator Ofqual despite the chaos.Boris Johnson broke off his Scottish holiday this morning to hold a call with the Education Secretary and other senior officials to discuss the huge change in policy.Tory MPs - including current serving ministers - rounded on the Government for the shambles and demanded they change course.Several Tories were rounding on the Education Secretary last week - amid speculation he could lose his job over the fiasco.After the u-turn he was   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post.Jessica OReilly of Ladbrokes said: Given the backlash to exam grades its perhaps not too much of a surprise that Williamson is the clear favourite now in a hotly contested market.And a YouGov poll this evening said  per cent of the public said he should quit.He said this afternoon when askedhe would consider quitting that he went to a comprehensive and is determined to fix this.Tory MP George Freeman hinted his job might be on the line.He told Times Radio: Ultimately, the Prime Minister is in charge. And I think he will want to take firm control of this and get a grip and show that his government is taking the le chances of a generation of children seriously... Im told the Prime Ministers you know, planning to reshuffle in the autumn, and I dare say he wants to take everything into account.Labour big beast and ex Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”Under-fire exams boss Sally Collier was today blasted for being “invisible” and more secretive than the KGB during the A Levels fiasco.The Ofqual boss - a lelong bureaucrat who earns a whopping £, a year – has not been seen or heard from throughout the fiasco.Fuming politicians and teachers said she must “show her face” and apologise to pupils let down by the disaster.They called for her to be put on her final warning and sackeda way out of the mess is not found.Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told The Sun: “Ofqual have been more secretive than the KGB.“They have behaved like secretive cardinals at the Vatican choosing a Pope rather than like officials developing a transparent grading system.“There is going to need to be fundamental changes at Ofqual when this is all over.”Former Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw branded the chaos a terrible farce and slammed invisible bosses at Ofqual.Steve Chalke, boss of the academy school chain Oasis, told The Sun that Ms Collier in in the last chance saloon.He said: “She should own up and apologise to every child for the emotional trauma and apologise to students and teachers.“This mess is an insult to teachers and pupils.“They had six months to get ready for this.”Askedshe should quit over the fiasco, he said: “I believe in forgiveness, but she needs to step up and explain herself.

Families on breaks in traditionally popular hotspots such as France, Spain and Portugal must quarantine for two weeks when they get back after the destinations were removed from the UKaposs travel corridor list to curb the spread of Covid-. Facing a fortnight of Government-ordered self-isolation, millions of cautious Brits desperate for a getaway have opted for a UK break instead – sparking a spike in staycations.Downing Street refused to deny tourists ing from Croatia and Greece could soon face quarantine measures after an increase in coronavirus cases in the countries.A No  spokesman said the Government continue to keep these rules under review and protecting public health remains its priority. Travel expert Paul Charles, of the PC Agency, suggested the Government should adopt an Icelandic airport testing scheme, subsidising the cost so passengers pay £. Passengers heading to Iceland have the option of booking a swab test on arrival instead of going into quarantine for  days. They must self-isolate for five days before taking a second test, which is free, at a medical centre. If both come back negative, they can carry on as normal. Total quarantine could be less than seven days. “We have to bring this system to the UK as soon as possible,” Mr Charles told the Daily Mail. “We cannot go on with this -day quarantine system, which is unworkable and causing anxiety among consumers who are losing money. “Adopting this Iceland system here would be a game-changer. “It is far better than the damage and scarring being done to the economy by quarantine measures.”  Airlines UK policy and public affairs director Rob Griggs told the Mirror: “The UK urgently needs a testing regime as an alternative to quarantine, as part of the new normal for aviation as we live with the virus. “Countries like Germany have already introduced a free, one test system for arrivals where, once you’ve had a negative result, you can leave isolation. “This is critical not just for opening up hugely important markets like the United States, but also for travel closer to home. “We’re at real risk of falling behind on testing and Government needs to get a move on.”  Heathrow Airport could offer a £, -second Covid- test to passengers arriving from virus hotspots.

The scheme would be ready to launch within two weeks of the Government saying those tested and whose results are negative could be released from quarantine early.  Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: “Testing will not only avoid the “quarantine roulette” that so many passengers faced in Spain and France, it will also open up flights to key trading partners such as the US, Canada and Singapore. “The Government’s own research shows that a double test has a high level of accuracy in screening for Covid. “This facility is an oven-ready opportunity to see how Britain can safely reopen for business, as other countries are doing.” How it works in Iceland Icelandaposs airport testing strategy is seen as a model for how travellers can avoid two weeksapos quarantine when they arrive on foreign soil.

Cancelling exams and shutting schools to most students to halt the spread of the virus undoubtedly harmed teenagers’ education but most people understand that big decisions had to be taken in a hurry. What most people do not and will not forgive is the resulting chaos. Teachers often get it wrong when predicting grades yet they still know far more about inidual children than a criticised, controversial, condemned computer model. Every child is supposed to matter.

Teachersapos predictions for A-level, AS-level and GCSE results will now be used instead of a bungled computer algorithm which left % of teenagers with downgraded marks. It came after calls for a U-turn from top Tories, Labour MPs and even advisors to the exam regulator Ofqual. But as the dust settles on the announcement, itaposs too late for some -year-olds to go to the university of their choice. Beleaguered Education Secretary Gavin Williamson failed to guarantee there will be enough capacity for all of them. He refused to resign but apologised to children, saying: It is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more signicant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process. We now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A and AS level and GCSE results. I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve. But Boris Johnson refused to cut short his holiday in Scotland to deal with the crisis.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: The Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco. Incompetence has become this Government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson ’s failure to lead is holding Britain back. He added: The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion. This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. So how did the row unfold and what happens nowyouaposre a GCSE or A-level student  Hereaposs what you need to know. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror. What caused all this  Coronavirus forced schools to shut and meant GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled this summer. But students still need results to leave school with - which have been worked out without those exams. How were A-level and GCSE grades decided   Studentsapos grades in England are based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. These are called aposCentre Assessment Gradesapos . But those CAGs were moderated by exam boards first, before they got turned into a final grade. This standardisation was supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from. What went wrong   % of all A-level grades in England were downgraded from the CAGs - including , by two or more grades - to standardise results and stop them inflating. Official figures show students in the poorest areas were marked down by .% while those in the richest were marked down by .%. That meant tens of thousands of students lost out on university offers. Some launched legal action. What  went wrong   The government announced pupils could appeal using their mock exam results instead. This was called a triple lock - they could use the standardised result, a mock, or a resit, whichever was highest. But this descended into farce as a whole weekend passed with no system for this in place. Ofqual, the exams regulator, issued guidance on Saturday but it was withdrawn after it went against the triple lock. What is todayaposs change  The government has now announced all GCSE, AS and A-level results in England will be based on the teachersapos original predicted grades . Or,youaposre in the small minority of students whose revised grade was higher than your predicted grade , you can keep the higher, revised grade. In other words, every single downgrade that was applied last week - around , of them - has officially been scrapped. Similar announcements with dferent details have already been made for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Essentially, the standardised grading system is now dead. Kaput. Zip. Gone. What about BTechs  Btechs are not included in todayaposs announcement for England. Gavin Williamson said he hoped the pledge will be extended to cover BTechs but it was not ready yet. He said: We very much want to include them on that. “We want to ensure there’s a maximum amount of fairness for youngsters right across the board. “There’s quite a bit of dference because there’s very little disparity in terms of the assessment of grades, of those who took BTechs and other vocational and technical qualications. “But we want to see parity right across the board in terms of how this is approached.” What happens now for students  Students who were preparing a dficult appeal will no longer need to lodge it, as they finally have certainty about what their grade will be. But todayaposs announcement raises as many questions for A-level and GCSE students as it answers. Especially those trying to get into universities - which may not have enough room. They have already rejected many applicants or awarded places to others through Clearing. Will GCSE results still come on Thursday  Yes. The government has said, now that this change is in effect, GCSE results will still be handed out on time this Thursday in England. Now my A-level results have changed, will I still be able to go to my chosen university this year  Itaposs more likely.But itaposs not guaranteed. Now that all students can stick with predicted grades, thousands more cango to their university of choice. But that university might have already rejected that student and offered a place to someone  through Clearing. Gavin Williamson said he would remove the cap on the number of students universities could take, but that doesnapost solve all the problems.The Education Secretary failed to guarantee every pupil will get the uni place they were offered - eventhey now have the right grades.  Askedhe could give that guarantee, Mr Williamson said: “We’re already working very closely with the university sector to make sure that we do everything we can do to build as much capacity in there. “We expect universities to be flexible, we expect them to go above and beyond, to honour those commitments. “But we also recognise, that’s why today we’ve lted student number caps in order for universities to be able to expand and put extra capacity into the system.” Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: Todayaposs policy change will mean that more students will have the grades that match the offer of their first choice university. This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place. We are seeking urgent clarication and advice from Government on a number of crucial issues.  John Craven, Chief Executive of upReach, said: It is not yet clear that all will be able to honour their offers given capacity constraints - eventhe student numbers cap at each university is indeed lted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It may already be too late for some A-level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. David Hughes, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, said: It is vital that information is provided speedily on how this decision will impact on higher education institutions, students wishing to apply through clearing and those who may have been rejected on their original grades. When will I formally get my new grades  Mr Williamson could not guarantee when formal exam certicates with the updated grades will arrive. But they will come “as swtly as possible”, either in paper or electronic form. GCSE students will not receive their certicates immediately when they pick up results on Thursday. Can I still take re-sitsI want to   The apostriple lockapos promised to students last week included taking re-sits in October to get a higher grade. This was not a new thing and people have been able to take resits in the past. That suggests that yes,your centre assessed grades were poor, you can take a re-sit. The deadline for entry is September . Weaposve asked the Department for Education and Ofqual what the process will be, and plan to update this story when we have more information. Can I still appeal with mock resultsI want to  Mock results will no longer be used in appeals after the government U-turn, Gavin Williamson suggested. He told reporters: “Mock exams won’t form the basis of the appeal process. “We believe obviously we’re going to see a large number of youngsters get a much higher grade than they previously anticipated. “And obviously we’ll have an appeals process that reflects those changed circumstances. “There will understandably be an appeals process, but mocks won’t be forming a key element of that.” Will I be able to appeal against my teacher-predicted grades  Students will be able to appeal their “centre assessment grades”- but the criteria haven’t yet been released. Gavin Williamson said this would be able to happenstudents felt teachers had shown “bias or discrimination” towards them. What happens now for government  Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to break off his holiday to deal with the fallout - and for bungling Gavin Williamson to quit. The Education Secretary is   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post. Meanwhile the fallout of this weekaposs fiasco will be far-reaching and last long beyond today. Getting rid of one problem - crushed grades - has of course created a new problem of grade inflation, which is why the government didnapost want to U-turn in the first place. That could have implications for those taking exams next summer. David Laws, Executive Chairman of the Education Policy Institute , said: The government should immediately establish an independent review of how this yearaposs results were handled, so that we can learn the lessons for the future and not repeat the many errors that have occurred this year. It should also consider the options for exams in , given next yearaposs candidates will have already been affected by the Covid- pandemic and there remains a chance of further lockdowns.

Now she believes it could have saved her le.At just  years old, she was young, fit and – she believed – in perfect health when she collapsed at her home in Essex in May. “I’ve always been into exercise as a way to keep fit and in shape,” says Loren, who worked as a teaching assistant before her travels. ”I was cooling down after doing my usual routine when I felt a sudden pain in my neck. It was very odd – like a big click inside my body. “My first thought was that I’d pulled a muscle, so I went to sit down. But a couple of minutes later, my boyfriend said I was looking a bit odd and passed me a glass of water. “Next thing, I collapsed. I was unconscious for  minutes – and when I started to come round, I couldn’t see.” What Loren thought was a muscle strain was in fact a stroke in the basilar artery of her brain – one of the most potentially devastating types of stroke, fatal in as many as % of cases. For those who survive, these strokes can leave patients with severe disabilities, including head-to-toe paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Yet miraculously, thanks to prompt and expert treatment, Loren is one of the lucky few who escape completely unscathed. Now she believes she’s alive and well because the coronavirus outbreak forced her to curtail her travels.  She was in Thailand, half-way through a two-year trip around the world with her boyfriend Harry Rodell, also , when the pandemic struck, forcing the couple toto the UK. They went into lockdown with Loren’s family in Chadwell St Mary, Essex and were there when Loren collapsed on May . “The paramedics told me that I’d probably had a stroke,” she says. “I thought that sounded pretty crazy, given my age and good health. I thought strokes were something that only happened to old people.”  While most strokes do occur in people aged over , the Stroke Association points out that they can happen at any age, even in babies. Loren was rushed to her nearest hospital in Basildon, where she was treated with clot-busting drugs, then transferred to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where she underwent a throm-bectomy. The procedure has to be carried out within hours of the stroke and involves inserting a small mesh hook into an artery in the groin, moving it up to the brain and pulling out the blood clot. It only works in a small proportion of stroke cases, but can have a big impact on reducing disability. As a fairly new “game-changing” procedure, it is currently not widely available. Had Loren not been in the UK when she had her stroke, it’s unlikely she would have been able to have the treatment. “The date I had my stroke, I should have been in Cambodia,” says Loren. “There, I wouldn’t have had speedy access to the amazing medical care that we tend to take for granted in this country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham on road lockdown coronavirus","story":"NewsBirmingham on road to lockdown as coronavirus infection rate doubles in a weekThe West Midlands citys officials are warning coronavirus rates could put it on national lists of areas most likely to require a local lockdown within daysShareCommentsByJane Haynes:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-outbreak-number-deaths-cases-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The cityaposs coronavirus infection rate has more than doubled in a week - with more than  new cases. Director of public health Dr Justin Varney said it was likely the city would feature in the national watch list of places most at risk of intervention within days. There is no sign of the current rise in Covid- cases easing off - with  new cases in the past week, reports Birmingham Live. We could very easily be in a situation like we have seen in Leicester and Greater Manchester, he said on Monday morning. Both areas have had lockdown restrictions imposed by health secretary Matt Hancock after seeing sustained spikes in infection. Concerns about Birmingham have been triggered by a rapidly rising rate of infections across the city. At the start of the month the city had an infection rate of around  cases per , population. That rose to  by the end of last week, and today stands at aposaround apos, he warned. That was in part due to more people being tested - but there was a real rise in infection transmission, he said. Speaking this morning, Dr Varney said: Looking at the national pattern, we have now overtaken Sandwell- it would not surprise meBirmingham joins that list. He said it was vital that people heeded advice and guidance and stopped flouting recommendations designed to keep the most vulnerable safe. There is much that concerns me, he said. He cited examples of people planning large wedding receptions that they are trying to hide and keep secret, and pass off as people happening to go to the same restaurant at the same time. Birmingham Live earlier reported complaints claiming venues around the city are permitting large gatherings to take place. Dr Varbey also voiced his frustration about growing numbers of illegal parties and street raves, including a gathering of hundreds in the heart of the city this weekend. West Midlands police attended around  gatherings last weekend, and received , calls registering complaints.  Dr Varneyaposs plea was to everyone to be aware that the virus still kills and is still just as infectious - but eventhat message did not land with some people, he warned a local lockdown would also affect jobs and livelihoods. If we have to go back into lockdown local businesses will suffer too. Itaposs about jobs, about kids being able to get back to school - the decisions we make now have an impact on  all of those things. How close is Birmingham to lockdown  The cityaposs infection rate is around . That contrasts with Leicester, which peaked at over  before lockdown restrictions were imposed. But it is now alarmingly close to the situation in Blackburn and Darwen, Lancashire, where signicant restrictions were reintroduced when the rate there reached around . What is driving increase  * Increase in  number of incidents in workplaces  as more go back to work and employees are not being as Covid safe as they should be. Dr Varney said: What we are hearing when we talk to themis that when people are doing their jobs they are keeping the m distance, but when they go for a cigarette break, or lunch, or leave work, they are not. *  Extended family gatherings We are seeing this is also about family gatherings. People are coming together, forgetting to keep their distance, and giving a hug or a handshake - and giving Covid with it, Dr Varney continued.  We have seen some clusters of people in the same extended family but living in dferent households who are sharing infection - and thataposs putting older, more vulnerable people at risk. *  Larger gatherings There is much that concerns me - whether people planning large wedding receptions that they are trying to hide and keep secret, and pass off as people happening to go to the same restaurant at the same time or holding illegal parties and street raves. This virus can still kill people and still just as infectious.

Bomb experts were scrambled to the Haddowsapos Fe home after Billy came across the unexploded First World War hand grenade on the banks of the River Carron and took it back to Alexaposs for a sleepover. Billy and Alex had been out exploring when they discovered what they thought were the preserved remains of an ancient animal or sea creature.Not realising what he had actually found, Billy and Alex took it to the Keseley household for an overnight stay on August , then brought it home to the Haddowsapos the following morning, reports the Daily Record. The bomb squad and police were called to detonate the device in a controlled explosion in a field near Billy’s home at Hill of Beath. Billy, a Beath High School pupil, said: “I thought I’d found a fossil, but my friend told me it was a grenade.“I had waders on and saw it on the river bank. It was on a little island in the middle of the river.”He said: “I thought it looked cool and would be fun to have as a decoration, but I didnapost realise it was live.”He said the police came to his family home to take a look: “They told me that it was live and that it was a bit silly taking it home.“They saidyou find something like that to leave it and call  for advice, and don’t touch it.”Police called in Army explosive specialists who cordoned off the area and blew up the device in a field off Torbeith Road. Billy’s mum Maureen, , said she gave the pair a “rollicking” for bringing the grenade into the house.She said the boys had been told by Alex’s dad to leave it alone, but had smuggled it back to Alex’s home on Friday, August  for their sleepover.Maureen said: “They stayed overnight with it and he showed me it at his brother’s house the next day.

A built-in barbecue, shed and a fire pit are also must-haves, the poll of , people found. Half would opt for a flat rather than tiered landscape, while  per cent want stone flooring compared to % who prefer decking. And when it comes to the grass, % favour the real thing while only %would like to have astro-turf. The research and image were commissioned by Onduline and found that overall, the average adultaposs dream garden would appear colourful , invitingand tidy . Paul Duffy, managing director of Onduline said: The research proves how important gardens are to residents of the UK and how we all aspire to have a aposdream garden. This has definitely become more apparent during recent months, with increased time spent at home, as we have all been day-dreaming about what our perfect home and garden would look like.  What was particularly interesting from the research was seeing how much time people spend in their gardens and outdoor buildings and therefore want it to be the perfect space whether for entertaining, working-out or relaxing. Tim Miller, from Tim Miller Design which created the D image to show the perfect garden, said: Many of my clients are looking for these top  garden features and itaposs lovely bringing them altogether in one project. The research also found a third would border their dream garden with a fence, while % prefer hedging. More than half would like a big enough space to house animals, including chickens , ducksand goats .  From wannabe farmers to active sports players, a tenth would also include a tennis court in their dream garden and another % would like an outdoor gym. It also emerged that on average, those polled think their perfect garden will cost more than £, to achieve. But a fth would put environmentally friendly products above the expenditure when planning their dream garden, and % feel itaposs important to use sustainable materials outside. More than half would get professionals in to create their inspirational garden, while a brave % would see it as a DIY project.  The study, carried out via OnePoll, also found that despite % being happy with their garden currently, only % feel they have their aposdreamapos garden. And a sixth are unimpressed with their outdoor space while a tenth even went as far as to say they were embarrassed by it. Currently, during the typical week, garden-owners spend seven hours in their outdoor space, along with three hours in their outbuildings - % have a summer house and % own a garage. More than a quarter use their outdoor buildings for relaxing, % have them as their work space and % enjoy hobbies in them.  Similarly, almost two thirds use their garden as a place to relax, while a fth regularly dine outside and % use the space to play with their children. Paul added: Outdoor buildings have always been a key feature of any garden, whether it is a shed or greenhouse, but this survey highlights that people dream of being more adventurous with their choices. Summer houses or animal pens may seem like very aspirational products but making the dream a reality is much easier than many may think. These days innovation in materials means it is much easier to install an outdoor building, and the job can easily be completed in a couple of hours.

Jonny McNally, , boarded the -passenger capacity Norwegian Jade in September last year for a six month stint cruising around the world. But what was meant to be six months for the assistant cruise director has turned into almost a year after the coronavirus pandemic left him marooned. After leaving County Antrim, Northern Ireland, to live with his girlfriend, Marjorie, , four years ago, Jonny now calls Subic, Philippines, home. But when the country closed its borders in March and Jonnyaposs tourist visa expired in May while stuck at sea, the crewman was left with bills to pay but no way of getting back. Speaking from the ship, which now has just  essential crew onboard, he said today: I was only meant to be on board for six months, I never imagined that I would be here for nearly a year. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Iaposve done long stints on ships before but at least I had a job to do, now every day has become Groundhog Day.

Itaposs very weird and strange to see the ship with so few people on it. It feels like a ghost ship at night time because the lights are dimmed or turned off in places where they wouldnapost usually be soyouaposre walking through the entertainment places everything is covered in white sheets in pitch black, itaposs pretty freaky. When the Covid- pandemic hit, the ship was sailing from Hong Kong to Singapore - but realising early on how serious the situation could become, Jonny asked to terminate his contract early so he could fly home.  After cancelling all their cruises, the passengers disembarked in Singapore and the ship set sail for Dubai in April to allow any remaining crew members to get home. But despite having a flight booked from Dubai to Manilla, on the morning Jonny was due to take off, the journey was cancelled when the city suddenly closed its airports, and the following day the Philippines closed its borders to non-Filipino nationals and visa-holders. With no way of getting into the country to renew his since expired visa, Jonny is now stuck on board the ship, which has been moored in Naples since June - when Italy lted its lockdown.  Jonny has been allowed to remain living in his quarters and receives a £. [ USD] daily allowance from his company to spend on board - but has burned through his savings after his full pay stopped four months ago. Jonny said: I get up in the morning, I go and have lunch and I go and walk around the open deck. I try to get at least , steps in everyday but I do the same thing every day You have to try to be creative in certain ways to stay alert and not get down in the dumps.

It struck me as odd, an adult engaging in a childhood pastime. Was I wrong! Adult colouring books have flooded bookshops everywhere in the last few years with their empty patterns of mandalas, animals and floral designs. But what makes them so popular  Colouring can help you channel your inner artist, de-stress and bring a sense of peace. But is there truly a benefit of colouring for adults  And does this pastime please and calm our brains  According to ­clinical psychologist Scott M Bea at ­Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, US, it’s all about refocusing our attention. “Adult colouring requires modest attention focused outside of self-awareness,” Dr Bea says. “It’s a simple activity that takes us outside ourselves in the same way as cutting the lawn, knitting or taking a Sunday drive.” How  Dr Bea cites three reasons why adult colouring can be calming. Attention flows away from ourselves with a simple absorbing act such as colouring. Your attention concentrates on the present moment. “In this way, it is very much like a meditative ­exercise,” Dr Bea says. It also relaxes the brain when thoughts are focused on a simple activity like colouring. “The dficulties of le evaporate from your awareness, and both your body and your brain may find this rewarding.” Low stakes make it pleasurable, especially colouring inside the lines.“It is hard to screw up colouring, and, evenyou do, there is no real consequence. Adult colouringcan be a wonderful escape, rather than a demanding test of our capacities,” he adds."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The story goes that Brad Pitt’s parents, Jane and William, have allegedly not seen their grandchildren since , because of a rt with their mother Angelina Jolie. For my kids, a spell that long away from such influential figures in their lives would be unacceptable. When my better half and I next take a few days off, we will have no compunction about trusting our little ones with their grandparents. The kids will demand it and rightly so. New research showing half of all mothers and fathers have fallen out with their own parents over the grandkids is symptomatic of the breakdown in our society. You only have to look at some of the areas over which they are fighting – discipline, manners, eating habits and screen time. It spooks me to consider just how old I sound saying this, but take a ride on a bus sometime – particularly before or after school – and observe the behaviour of some of today’s youngsters, particularly towards the older generation.  Listen to the language, observe the lack of respect. Then compare it to the way you treated your elders growing up. Consider how many of those kids would benefit from the traditional values on which we were raised. Yes, of course we want to be progressive in the way we bring up our kids. Yetwe are honest we’d all admit to bones of contention with our parents over which they were ultimately proven right. Nor would they approve of the way that iPads and iPhones are used as virtual babysitters now. Studies have shown, too, that extended periods of time with grandparents increases a child’s emotional intelligence and positively affects the way that they relate to their elders. It extends their vocabulary with grandparents taking the time to play and read books while parents are busy working. Time with the elders leaves a child more likely to understand their family history with grandparents able to provide context and perspective.

There have been many reports about a fallout surrounding which glitzy band the future Duchess of Sussex would wear on her big day, and the authors of a new book have claimed Harry was forced to step in. It was originally believed that the Queen wouldnapost allow Meghan to have her chosen tiara, but the new biography Finding Freedom claims the Sussexesapos row was actually with her dressmaker and close friend Angela Kelly. Speaking in an interview about the book, one of the authors, Omid Scobie, claims Angela made things very dficult - resulting in a heated phone call between the Queen and Harry. Speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Scobie explains that the meeting where Meghan picked her tiara was actually a huge success. He said: The tiara selection went wonderfully. The Queen was very happy, Meghan was very happy. In fact Meghanaposs words when that story came out were aposhow sad, I love my tiaraapos.  The drama took place afterwards, when Meghan wanted to try that tiara on with her hair stylist, because there is a lot of tech that goes into this. They had to do an experiment with that before the wedding day. The hairstylist came in from overseas, there was an appointment at Buckingham Palalce, but nobody was there. Scobie claims that Meghan kept trying to book in a day to do the trial run, but struggled to pin Angela down. He said: Each time Angela Kelly isnapost available to arrange this, to facility this, despite agreeing to. It got to the point where staff around Harry and Meghan were tearing their hair out because the wedding was a couple of weeks away, months had passed at this point. Harry had to intervene. He called his grandmother and said, aposI donapost know what the hell is going on, but this woman needs to make this work for my future weapos.  We can see kind of see now where this aposwhat Meghan wants, Meghan getsapos narrative came from. He goes on: Harry felt that there were those within the institution that would stop at nothing to at the very least to make Meghan’s le dficult. “Meghan didn’t get to try the tiara on again until a few days before the wedding.” "},{"url":null,"title":"set life results live winning","story":"NewsSet For Le results LIVE: Winning lotto numbers and draw for Monday, August A le-changing £,-per-month prize for the next  years is the top prize in tonights draw.

The government was forced to backtrack on its controversial Covid- awards process, announcing that teachersapos predictions would now stand. It came after tens of thousands of students saw their results downgraded by Ofqualaposs heavily-criticised algorithm. But it remains unclear what happens now with university applications, with many teens having missed out on their first choice because of the governmentaposs shambolic handling of results. Alaa Muhammad, who had faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine in Pakistan after being downgraded, said: I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again.Did you miss out on a place at university because of downgrading  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror    Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted ABB to EDD due to the heavily criticised algorithm. The stark drop saw her post an emotional plea on Twitter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I deserve to know why you have ruined my chance at le. Why I donapost feel like living anymore. Why I feel like all my hard work and money has gone to waste, she wrote in the tweet, which was retweeted more than , times. Ms Muhammad said she had paid more than £, to take resits at a private college after her studies in year  and  were disrupted.  She now hopes she will be able to find a university place after all. Journalist Lucinda Day fumed that a brilliant Sixth Form student she mentored had missed out on university places - which have since been filled. She wrote: The brilliant state school student I mentored over the past year, had her predicted A-level results downgraded from A* A A to A C C and lost her place to study law at Exeterchoice  Edinburgh . Now the govt have u-turned  the university places have gone. Being awarded what she undoubtedly would have achieved anywayis little consolation when you’re still unable to take up the university place you worked so hard for.  The incompetence of this govt impalpable. Student Thomas Jukes, who missed out on a place to study medicine at the University of Birmingham due to his A-level results being downgraded, questioned why the rubbish algorithm was used in the first place. Iaposm much more pleased now I have got my centre-assessed grades. Itaposs just dependent now on whether my places have been held, he told the PA news agency. If they managed to turn around in four days and say, aposwell, you can just have your centre-assessed gradesapos, it wouldnapost have been that much hassle in the first place, would it  I think they put a lot of time and effort into this rubbish algorithm, which has been a monumental failure, to just literally give us what the teachers predicted us anyway.  The -year-old, from Great Barr in Birmingham, said that he contacted the university as soon as he found out the news in the hope that his place had been held. I just gave them a call and they said they canapost update us at this time, more information will be on the website soon, that kind of thing, he added.One A-level student posted on Twitter that the hard work and stress she had put in was finally recognised.She wrote: I am OVER THE MOON!!! on results day I wasn’t happy. I didn’t get the results I deserve with  UCAS points I was looking at foundation years resitting. But now I have more than enough UCAS points for uniand all the hard work and stress is recognised.  Yasmin Walker, who said she wasnapost planning to go to uni but had friends who had missed out on their top choices, wrote: Spaces are full  it won’t fix the stress they’ve been put through already. Absolute shambles. Fawad Sajid, , of Kingsbury, north-west London, said the Governmentaposs U-turn was late but it is better late than never. Standing outside the Education Department in central London, he said: For the greater good, this change is definitely a step in the right direction but I still feel there needs to be a process in which students can appeal against their teachersapos . Some students will naturally feel that having that assessment is not fair either. These appeals need to be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Yasmin Edwards accused the retail giant of preying on the the body insecurities of new mothers. The -year-old, of Kehelland in Cornwall and formerly of Bristol, says Tesco is shaming new mothers into losing weight and making money from their insecurities. Yasmin, who noticed the placement in her local Camborne store, told Cornwall Live: On Saturday I went to Tesco in Camborne to pick up essentials for my seven-month-old daughter Daphne and saw SlimFast meal replacement products in amongst baby products . They were clearly marketed at new mothers and preying on their body insecurities. It’s absolutely disgraceful how a household name is trying to monetise the vulnerabilities of new mothers.” Yasmin has since contacted Tesco but has yet to receive a response. She added: “I really do think it is despicable. “Amidst infant medication, baby moisturiser and baby bath products, were a number of SlimFast products, including shakes. There were no other products aimed at adults in this section. “The SlimFast plan advises the consumer that the ‘weight loss shakes are a total meal replacement solution’ and to ‘replace two meals a day with original shakes’. “By placing these products in the same row, adjacent to and above, baby products and marketing at mothers Tesco is effectively shaming mothers, particularly new mothers, into weight loss and instead of congratulating them on growing and birthing a human , they are telling women that their bodies are not good enough and monetising their insecurities. Yasmin said that new mothers should not be encouraged to replace meals with the slimming drinks as they need food to fuel them and breastfeed their tot. “Globally, the UK has one of the lowest rates of breastfeeding - in order to establish breastfeeding women need food to fuel them Yasmin said. In order to look after their babies women need food to fuel them. In order to repair and recover their bodies after pregnancy and childbirth women need food to fuel them. “Post-partum women should not be encouraged to ‘replace two meals a day’ with anything let alone weight loss shakes. “It is insensitive at best and disgusting at worst. Targeting vulnerable new mothers is absolutely appalling and Tesco really should be ashamed of themselves.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman shares odd symptoms experienced","story":"NewsWoman shares odd symptoms she experienced before cancer diagnosis aged threeEmily Maylin, , from Ongar, spent years in and out of hospital fighting acute lymphoblastic leukaemia after she developed chicken pox and her skin turned translucent before her hand became swollenShareCommentsByLouise Lazell:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsEmily and Amy are doing a charity sky e to raise money for Blood Cancer UK\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Emily Maylin, , from Ongar, was told she had leukemia aged just three after suffering a bout of chicken pox. Everything had been fine until her mum Jenny noticed she seemed to be taking longer than normal to recover. Her skin had become a sickly pale and she was unusually tired - not her usual bouncy self, reports EssexLive. When Emilyaposs hand started to swell up, her parents knew something wasnapost quite right. A trip to the hospital sent Emily to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge for blood tests which came back with news they could never have prepared themselves for. Emily was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a blood cancer which can progress quickly and aggressively. For the next two years of her le, Emily was in hospital with her family having chemotherapy and treatment. As the youngest child of four, Emily was the last of her siblings to get chicken pox. Jenny had no initial concerns when Emily caught the infection, but started to become worried when she wasnapost improving. She had that period of chicken pox and didnapost seem to recover, the -year-old said. All my other children had got better but Emily didnapost get back to herself. But there was nothing particularly noticeable, although she was falling asleep a lot. What led us to the diagnosis was she had a swollen hand. We took her to the doctors and they couldnapost see anything on her hand that seemed to be causing the problem. One of the things which made me query at the doctors was why she was so pale, her skin was almost translucent. We were sent home to keep an eye but I went back next day because her hand was getting worse and there were red blotches up her arm. They sent her for a blood test and we got a result back the same day. The family were told to take Emily off to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge with some clothes to stay over in. After several more tests and checks, the hospital confirmed that Emily had leukemia. It was pretty upsetting, Jenny said. I didnapost really know what the treatment was, or what they could do or what the survival rates were. Itaposs come a long way since then. Being only three at the time, Emily said she can only really remembers the dficult parts. I donapost remember an awful lot, but I remember the negative bits, Emily said. I remember the injections in the hospital and having to drive there from my home and being woken up in middle of the night to go to hospital.  And having my hickman line taken out and just lying and screaming really and the constant blood tests. I remember some of the nurses being really lovely though. The next two years of Emilyaposs le revolved around the hospital, blood tests and chemotherapy to make sure she got better. I remember mum slept on a bed that pulled down next to mine, so she was next to me, Emily said. I remember being sick quite a bit and my mouth being wiped. The impact on Emily at such a young age naturally affected her, where she would be woken up in the middle of the night for more blood tests and taking a mix of drugs from chemotherapy and steroids. It wasnapost easy but the staff at the hospital were phenomenal, Jenny said. They were so dedicated and the doctors were very good at telling us exactly what were the treatments and what was happening. Emily had just begun play school a few weeks before she caught chicken pox and was subsequently diagnosed with leukemia and didnapost . Returning for primary school, things were a little dferent to make sure Emily was safe. I had a medical box at infant school forI fell over, Emily explained One time I ran into a fence and cut my knee and they said Emily has to go to the teacheraposs head office where I had my knee cleaned. It was with anything with blood becauseit gets infected it can be very dangerous. I remember being at school and knowing something was dferent about me. I had short hair and they used to think I was a boy. For the next ten years after treatment, Emily visited the hospital for regular check-ups. Where I was a bit confused, I didnapost understand what had happened really, I didnapost see any worries, Emily said. I was just a normal kid and wanted normal things. When I got a bit older, as a teen you start to worryit does come back and you understand a bit more about it. Itaposs not the easiest thing to come out of the other side, having had chemo, I did get ill quite badly a few times because I had a lowered immune system. Now, Emily and her sister, Amy Maylin, are trying to raise as much money as possible for Blood Cancer UK to help others with le-threatening cancers.

The woman proceeded to complain about the mumaposs swimming costume, suggesting it wasnapost appropriate attire for the class.Writing on Reddit, in a post which has since been deleted, the stunned mum explained what happened, saying: Today, there was a new baby at swim class! He looked to be about the same age as my son. As the father got into the pool, he said hi and I ed the greeting. I then asked him how old his son was and we made about  seconds of small talk before the class started. After class was over and my son and I were leaving the pool area, this man’s we approached me and said, aposYou know,you are going to continue to swim with husbands and fathers, you should really dress more modestlyapos.  The mum in the pool had been wearing a tankini, a two-piece swimsuit with a tank top and high-waisted bottoms.She described the swimming costume and shared a link to an identical one which is for sale on Amazon. You could see maybe three inches of my stomach, she said. And not that it matters, but I am completely flat chested with no butt, so it’s not like my voluptuous curves were a distraction or anything. The mum added that she was caught completely off guard by the womanaposs comment and didnapost know how to respond, so just thanked her for her opinion.

The approved bill allows the production, commercialisation and supply of chlorine dioxide solution to prevent COVID- and as a treatment for sick patients. Chlorine dioxide is usually used as a disinfectant or to whiten paper products but in recent years it has been hailed as a miracle cure which is able to treat most illness and health conditions by conspiracy theorists and alternative medicine advocates. Calling it Miracle Mineral Solution or MMS the belief is claimed to be gaining influence in Latin America where countries are struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.  There have been cases across Bolivia of people being hospitalised after taking chlorine dioxide, Business Insider reports.Boliviaaposs own ministry of health has warned people not to take it and will prosecute anyone producing and selling it. In June medical regulators in the country released a statement warning that chlorine dioxide puts the health of the population that consumes or intends to do so at serious risk.It added that the US Food and Drug Administration says it has recorded reports of severe vomiting, severe diarrhoea, le-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure after drinking these products. Both houses of the Bolivian parliament are controlled by the left-wing MAS party, which also used to control the presidency. But the MAS president Evo Morales was ousted last year following allegations of election fraud so the role is currently held by the caretaker government of the opposition conservative Jeanine Añez. Sergio Verdugo, an Associate Professor of Universidad del Desarrollo Law School, Chile, told Business Insider that under the Bolivian constitution Añez can either approve or reject bill. Butshe rejects it the legislative assembly can override her decisionthere is an absolute majority of legislators there when the vote takes place.  The passing of the bill could strain relations between Añez and Boliviaaposs legislators weeks before the countryaposs delayed presidential election which will take place on October . It was originally scheduled for September , but the president delayed them over fears of coronavirus spreading.

There is also a new ban on the sale of alcohol in any form of transport linked to tourism. The measures are part of a new package of restrictions which come into effect tomorrow.

It follows outrage in recent weeks following photos of crammed pool parties and boats - where revellers are not wearing masks or social distancing. The restrictions come as part of tougher measures across Spain with pubs and restaurants having to close at am. No new customers can be accepted past midnight and capacity has been slashed. Nightclubs and cocktail bars have been closed and smoking is banned in public places where social distancing of two metres cannot be maintained.

Gabi Goddard was working out when she claims a member of staff at the gym in Hornsby, Sydney, approached and told her she would have tohome to changeshe wanted to continue her session. The -year-old actor was told a school teacher who was also visiting the gym with some of her students had complained to staff over worries the children could see aposso much skinapos.Gabi shared a photo of her a outfit on Instagram, stating it was in no way gratuitous and was worn during  degree heat in a sun-soaked gym with no air conditioning.She wrote: Today I was asked to leave my gym because a school teacher had a problem with this outfit and complained. Itaposs a hot day, the air con was not on, but apparently this government teacher was concerned about the children seeing so much skin. She then posted the complaint she had sent to the head of the school in , stating that one of the teachers had asked that she shouldnapost be allowed to workout at the gym due to the shorts she was wearing. The letter read: My heavy lting workouts require me to use a signicant range of motion meaning that fitted  stretchy clothes are necessary. Due to the heat today and level of energy used, I was wearing the most practical thing: workout shorts. Gabi said she was horried the school had a sway over her clothing choices and that the behaviour of the teacher was perpetuating that we live in a world where -year-old boys are given priority over women - where women are punished for boysapos and mensapos propensity for objectying women.  As a government institution, what right do you have to be representing such values  she asked. I would like to reiterate that the outfit I was wearing today was in no way gratuitous. It was very appropriate for the situation, and violated no dress codes. I have worn such outfits in many gyms and never had a single complaint. It is discouraging that this particular complaint came from a person charged with moulding our next generation into well-round adults ones who respect women and shun rape culture. She added thatthe teacheraposs goal was to teach her female students to be ashamed of ever showing their body, even in the pursuit of a healthy body and mind, she did an awesome job by publicly shaming her in front of them. Gabi then shared the response from the school, which said the complaint didnapost come from their member of staff and the matter was between you and the gym management.

The community has been involved throughout the design process and will continue to be given opportunities to remain involved throughout the build.“The public artwork has been undertaken by an artist who recently held a community workshop and it is hoped local children will become involved in this – lockdown put the brakes on that, however, we hope to be able to get this up and running once more.”The development will be accessible for OAPs and wheelchair users, with a mix of similar properties and family homes.Architect Ewan Imrie said: “Our proposals aim to preserve and enhance many of the excellent qualities of the previous scheme.“The design is intended to provide strong, distinct, attractive frontages to the pedestrian friendly streets to foster a strong sense of identity and community pride.”Convenience store The Kiosk, at the junction of Arbroath Road and Dalkeith Road, will also be rebuilt.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We went through four padlocks in three weeks.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

joining the Borders Book Festivals online audience to talk about his latest book, Hope In Hell: A Decade To Confront The Climate Emergency.Porritt, , is one of the UKs leading environmental activists, whose roles have included chair of The Ecology Party , director of Friends of the Earth, and co-founder of Forum for the Future, a sustainable development charity.Author of nine other books, Porritt hopes his latestwill reach \"a combination of dferent audiences\", the most important of which, he says, is the young people who are inheriting the impacts of manmade climate change.\"My sense today is that young people are the ones who are really going to suffer most from the accelerating climate impacts that we are now witnessing,\" Porritt tells the Border , \"and every single day for the whole of the rest of their lives will in one way or another be impacted by climate change.\"He adds: \"I talk a lot in the book about what I call intergenerational injustice how one generation has basically made it practically impossible for the next generation to have the same prospects, the same expectations, the same hopes as previous generations have had.\"The book, which stresses the urgency of fighting climate change, is also aimed at the \"weary environmentalists\" who have \"been plugging away\" at campaigning and those, says Porritt, \"who have no pre-existing knowledge or deep understanding of climate change, who I hope will be able to get stuck in really quickly and pick up everything they need to know within the first four chapters.\"Porritt has little time for the idea that human activity might not have had an impact on climate change, or that the subject is over-egged by the media or environmental activists.He says: \"I dont believe there is any serious continuing debate about whether climate change is happening or whether its caused by our lestyles or our economy and I think theres less and less of a debate about it not being serious.\"I think thats symptomatic of a change going on in peoples minds because they can see the impacts of climate change.\"The veteran campaigner believes that any failure of iniduals to change their behaviour is not down to climate change denial but what he calls \"disavowal\" ndash \"As in, I see this is happening but perhaps Im not the person who can make a dference, so I will continue to be a bystander rather than an active participant in addressing this challengersquo,\" says Porritt.\"The story of the next decade is getting more and more people to come away from that bystander role and to be prepared to get stuck in.\"And Porritt believes this \"disavowal\" is part of the reason governments can be slow to enact policies to combat climate change.\"Thats what makes it possible for the politicians to go on downgrading the signicance of climate change,\" he says.ldquoOur politicians are not in denial but they are absolutely not addressing it as the emergency that the science now tells us it is.\"And you can see that in the policies they brought forward in response to the pandemic ndash the build back better movement has actually just become build build build.\"The UK governments \"classic failure of deeper political understanding\" is one reason the countrys economy struggled during lockdown, believes Porritt.He says: \"Instead of using this as a fantastic opportunity to show how we could have an economy that is prosperous but very low carbon all were doing is defaulting to exactly the same kind of policy growth band positions that we were in before COVID.\"Having had this shock, this really traumatic impact on our expectations of what a good le looks like, its incumbent on us to learn that lesson, and use it to help shape a more resilient and compassionate economy, one that is more mindful of environmental stewardship obligations for ourselves as well as future generations.\"And it is the future generations who Porritt sees pushing for change.He says: \"It was so interesting when Greta Thunberg was here in the UK. I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change. We dont want you to be hopeful on our behalf, we want you to be active on our behalfrsquo.He concludes: \"Would you not be annoyedyou were a young person who was suddenly confronted by the reality of climate change ldquoOnly to hear politicians say, Well, its dficult to address this, I think this is a challenge for future generations.\"It makes me feel pretty mad even at the advanced age of , when I hear politicians talking like that ndash its so complacent, its so self-indulgent, its so contemptuous of the interests of young people today.\"To see in Jonathon Porritt in conversation with journalist and broadcaster Sheena McDonald, go to bordersbookfestival.org online-event jonathon-porritt-hope-in-hellThe Borders Book Festival is sponsored by Baillie Gford."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-lowrie-completes-fundraiser-memory-late-sister","story":"GALASHIELS man Craig Lowrie has completed his fundraising challenge ndash and he says the donations total is ldquounbelievable.Mr Lowrie has now run a dozen km runs during the Border summer festival season, having completed his final event in Coldstream on Friday .\"It was always going to be an emotional run as it was the last one,\" said Mr Lowrie, of Selkirk, whose son Robbie was last yearrsquos Braw Lad in Galashiels.The challenge was created after this yearrsquos festivals were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.Around pound, has been raised, according to Mr Lowrie, with the money going to the festival committees, as well as the Borders General Hospital.However, Mr Lowrie dedicated his efforts to his late sister, Donna Cameron, of Innerleithen, who died in a road collision last year, just two weeks before her nephews appearance as Braw Lad.Following the completion of the runs, Mr Lowrie said: \"It was good to get them finished ndash the running was the easy bit.Reflecting on Fridayrsquos event, he added: \"My sisters kids and husband were coming down, and apart from Innerleithen they had not been to any of the other runs.\"Mr Lowrie was due to be joined by his son in Coldstream, but Robbie had an injury which left him on crutches.But Mr Lowrie didnt run his last challenge alone ndash former Selkirk Standard Bearer Rory Monks joined in.\"Rory stepped forward to run with me,\" said Mr Lowrie. \"I was glad to have the company as on my own it would have been gruelling.\"At the time of going to print, Mr Lowrie estimated that his fundraiser had reached a total of around pound, - with just over pound, being raised through his online Go Fund Me page.\"Its phenomenal, said Mr Lowrie. \"I sat with Robbie at the beginning of the summer to talk about it.\"I didnt expect anything near what weve done ndash its unbelievable.\"Once he had completed his mammoth task, racking up more  kilometres across the summer, Mr Lowrie gave a speech to supporters through a Facebook livestream.In his speech, Mr Lowrie said: \"Especially in these uncertain times we live in, you made the dference ndash I only ran.\"The comments you guys have posted each week ndash some heartfelt, some really encouraging, some quite funny ndash all really did mean a lot to me and gave me a great sense of pride.\"To support Craig Lowries fundraiser, visit his Go Fund Me page."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-pavilion-cinema-reveals-date-reopening","story":"THE Pavilion Cinema in Galashiels will reopen to the public next week.The Market Street venue has been closed for the last five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.But film lovers will be able tonext Friday .Cinema manager Andrew Poole said: ldquoThe past few months have been the longest and hardest in our familyrsquos  years in running cinemas.\"But we have survived and we are ready to reopen, albeit under extraordinarily dficult conditions.\"When we reopen, we will have a range of measures in place to protect our customers including fewer performances to allow deeper cleaning of halls between shows, one-way systems at the concessions stand, perspex screens, hand sanitiser stations throughout the building and we will be adhering to the physical distancing rules in place at that time.\"We are able to ensure our customers are sat two metres apart in the cinema hall using our booking system.\"All customers are encouraged to book in advance, but tickets will be available at the cinema.\"Classic films will be shown at first, before Christopher Nolans Tenetis screened on August .Mr Poole added: \"Films such as Peter Rabbit, Jumanji, The Greatest Showmanand Harry Potterwill play alongside Disneyrsquos Onwardwhich had only been showing for a week before we closed.\"We will also be showing Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, currently celebrating its th anniversary.\"We havenrsquot been idle during lockdown.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice.

Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles.

Add to that the tsunami of appeals that secondary teachers face having to process and there is a risk that the pressure will become overwhelming.One way to fix this would be to revert to teachersrsquo estimates for grades which have been reduced.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea. To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

It soon ran into problems.Landowners denied access, requiring a detour, putting Aberlady station half a mile from the village.

This will be particularly important post-Covid when the area is likely to be suffering alongside many others from store closures and reduced footfall.ldquoOn the subject of the introduction of a mph zone for the town, this too is to be welcomed.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Should I even be travelling when there are new infections daily, people are still in hospital and, yes, people are still dying  Is it insensitive, distasteful even  A friend soothes that people are going to travel anyway, so at least Irsquom trying to offer an insight into what itrsquos like. Another friend just bluntly declares itrsquos my job so get on with it like everyone .I wonrsquot just be going anywhere. Broadcasting on BBC Radio recently I was reminded of how dferent the situation and sentiment is in some of Scotlandrsquos island communities. Understandable when NHS Western Isles are the only health board in Scotland to record zero Covid- deaths to date. Irsquom acutely aware of our safety too as Irsquom sitting by my we Jenny with our two young daughters in the back. Wersquove multiple face masks and a gooey hand gel lake decanted into ious vessels. I spend the first half hour reminding the girls of the Scottish Governmentrsquos snappy FACTS campaign. Snappy, but I still need to look up what the lsquoCrsquo stands for.First up is Loch Melfort Hotel, a real escape out on the wild and wildly beautul west coast of Argyll. The owner is a high heidjin in Visit Scotland so they should get it right. Over a physically distanced coffee with the isles of Luing, Jura and Scarba sparkling behind him Calum Ross explains: ldquoItrsquos a real balance between making sure we take all the essential public health precautions, while at the same time ensuring itrsquos still an enjoyable and rewarding experience for our guests.Reassuringly Loch Melfort do get it right. They have clear signage branded with an image of Dougal, one of the Highland Cows who grazes happily outside, oblivious to the pandemic swirling around. lsquoDougal saysrsquo signs remind us to socially distance and to use the gel dispenser as we enter the lobby. He pops up again in our room helping us to find the hotel directory online.In the restaurant staff wear visors and dispense sanitised plastic menus. I momentarily miss a crisp white linen tablecloth, but this is soon forgotten when my Argyll beef fillet topped with local langoustines sweeps in. The girls and Jenny are tucking in too. I see Dougal outside. He seems to approve. As do our fellow diners. Itrsquos good to be with strangers smiling and laughing rather than just seeing our neighbours clap awkwardly on a Thursday.Next up wersquore off on a cruise ship. The Foreign Office almost stymies us by bringing in a blanket ban on cruise travel just before we sail. Fortunately wee Red Moon is husband and we run and takes just four passengers so our nuclear family is a charter rather than a cruise.Scott and Mary welcome us aboard like old friends, just ones who donrsquot shake hands anymore. Their trim, beautully fitted out marine hotel is equipped with a flotilla of hand gel and they explain theyrsquoll clean our bathroom daily, just not our cabins. They stress the use of gel going ashore and also that we must stay away from Maryrsquos cooking space in the galley.We spend four days puttering around close to shore after deciding to avoid inhabited isles. We ramble around rugged Bernera, where once St Columba preached under a giant yew tree. It doesnrsquot look like anyone has visited since. We also take the tender ashore in an overnight anchorage at Loch arsquo Choire in Morvern. We do stumble upon locals, but they are red deer and soaring golden eagles. Just off Lismore we are graced with a sea eagle and dolphins.Then it happens. On sleepy Balnagowan we presume the islandrsquos owner is not around. We row ashore to avoid disrupting the local seal colony, who are intrigued by our landing party and send scouts over to investigate. I ramble off alone, mindful of protective nesting seabirds and there she is. The lady owner of Balnagowan. I immediately spill into apologetic mode, but she stops me in my tracks with a beaming smile saying how happy she is just to see someone. Lockdown must have been very lonely on Balnagowan.Back on land we gun east for Perthshire and the cosseted world of Gleneagles. But can you achieve world-class five-star luxury in the time of Covid- with safety precautions in and swimming pools and spas out  The answer is a resounding yes. On arrival no one seems to mind the lack of valet parking as they shimmy respectfully through the grand racing green lobby sticking to the left as signs advise. We sanitise ourselves before meeting the receptionist, whose smile beams through her mask and screen. Again these measures reassure rather than concern.The swimming pools may be off bounds, but impressively the spa has managed to re-open, offering limited virus sensitive treatments such as a face down massages. All the restaurants have re-opened. We savour the excellent Indian dishes of the Dormy , the swish new Birnam Brasserie, with its fish and meat grills, and that grand old world dame, the Strathearn.At the Strathearn theyrsquove retained the white linen tablecloths, though they politely inform us we have to look after our own napkins ndash treacherous waters for a serial napkin dropper like myself. Once we settle in we soon forget about their visors and the sommelier is just the ever helpful sommelier and the waiters just supremely friendly waiters.In lieu of swimming we do what governments on both sides of the border have been recommending ndash get outdoors. First up is gundog training, a country pursuit I never experienced growing up on a council house scheme in West Lothian, but which thrills the girls who donrsquot care about having to wear plastic gloves. Then it is on to archery, shooting and falconry as we rattle through a greatest hits of Scottish country sports. Kids are really looked after here, even more so these days as Scott Dunn have just introduced their first ever UK programme of activities this month with Covid-era staycations in mind.When Scotlandrsquos well-heeled travellers realise a foreign holiday this year is a forlorn hope, Gleneagles is ready. But not everyone can splash out on such decadence. Our last stop is just up the road. We swap fluffy robes and marble bathrooms for a converted Leyland horse truck.Camping is all the rage this summer. As the author of Cool Camping: Scotland thatrsquos great to see. If the thought of struggling up your own tent on a windy west coast beach is too much, though, glamping tempts. Alexander House offers a brace of Mongolian style yurts, which are cosy with wood burning stoves and a surprising amount of space, with a separate bathroom with stand alone baths. The decking hosts a gas bbqand a wood fired hot tub. Once we work out how not to cook ourselves itrsquos a joy.The new option at Alexander House is Juniper. This vintage Leyland horse truck has been converted into a surprisingly swish hideaway. Itrsquos like a chic urban Airbnb inside, all fresh smelling wood ling and hipster deacutecor and furnishings. It also boasts a wee kitchen and the luxury of electricity. Outside wersquove got your own wee fenced area so you can bring a dog. And two kids. Ours love the resident brace of Highland cows who are very interested in our stay. Perhaps Dougal has forewarned them.Irsquove not mentioned Covid- for a few paragraphs and thatrsquos telling. We are now Covid-era travelling veterans, just enjoying the glorious outdoors and the scenery. For the record there are gel stations at the yurts and Juniper, the welcoming couple who run it donrsquot shake hands and wersquore assured our accommodations have been scrupulously sanitised. At the end of our stay our bedding is deep cleaned off site.When we eked out of our drive it was with real anxiety after being cooped up staring at pandemic ravaged TV screens. Everywhere we went, though, we have been reassured not only by the set-up, but also by the professionalism and consistency of the staff. The only aberrations were from fellow travellers not well versed in Scotlandrsquos lockdown measures, but thatrsquos similar to the confusion you can encounter in your local supermarket. If yoursquore thinking of a staycation our message would be go. Oh, but learn the FACTS beforehand unlike me.

They clasp hands to cross the road. The pensioner watches, wondering precisely what he is feeling. The realisation comes slowly.It is the tenth week of lockdown in the new calendar that pays no heed to the day of the week or the month. The pensioner looks at the boy swing on the end of his fatherrsquos arm. The old man, who lives alone, realises he has not touched another human being for  days.Unprecedented, he mutters to himself, using the term that has infected the language with the same facility with which coronavirus has changed the lives of everyone.His family is another county, barred from visiting him. His partner is self-isolating, outwith touching distance.Unprecedented. In his  years, he cannot have gone  days without human touch. Never. The realisation intrigues him rather than depresses him. It falls into one category of the serenity prayer that he says daily. It is one of things he must accept because he cannot change it.The summit offers a view down into Glasgow. There are the high flats of the northern escarpment. The city lies some miles in their shadow. He wonders how others are dealing with the crisis.He knows he is old. But there are those older. He knows he is alone. But he knows he is not lonely, though he considers there must be many in the maw before him who are desperately so.How are others coping  What is it like to be ageing, vulnerable, alone  The thoughts vex him.I know precisely how he feels and thinks. I am that pensioner. I am the father and grandparent who watched the wee boy clutch a dadrsquos hand. I am the grateful old dodderer who stood on the hill and prayed with an unusual fervour and an even rarer selflessness that those less fortunate were being consoled by love in the time of coronavirus.IN moments of trial, and they came in a baleful consistency from March, Betty Satti would look at her husband and start to talk. It mattered not that he had died more than five years before and she was addressing a photograph.\"You do strange things when you are down,\" she says. \"I was married to him for  years. We were close. It is still hard.\"Lockdown made it harder. Betty, , walked out her front door on Wednesday for the first time since lockdown was imposed. She has the stock response of her generation to questions about how she came though such an ordeal. \"You just have to get on with it,\" she says.But how  \"I have my two sons. I couldnrsquot see them physically because I was shielding but I could talk to them. I had my friends.\"This help included Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, a charity that has existed for  years but found its definitive moment in a time of greatest crisis. \"It is good to know somebody outside your family is thinking of you,\" Betty says. Those thoughts were matched by action.Unprecedented. The word is spoken by Richard Donald, chief executive of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. There is no glibness to the expression. Rather, it is spoken in awe at what his organisation had faced and how it reacted.The simple figures can be succinctly put: in  days the charity delivered more than  food parcels and made  phone calls to vulnerable older adults.There was a motion commending the work in the Scottish Parliament last week. The thoughts of the recipients remain largely unheard. But the gratitude is immense. There were reports of pensioners who had not had a proper meal for three or four days. The charity moved urgently.\"We had to adapt and adapt quickly,\" says Mr Donald, who took over his role during the crisis and thus had a baptism not of fire but of some raging inferno. \"It was disarray at first,\" he says. \"How do you deal with something that has never happened before \"The charity has four main purposes: to give welfare advice, to provide a befriending service, to operate three day-care centres and to organise more than  clubs. Priorities changed quickly.\"People needed food parcels,\" says Mr Donald. \"Celtic FC Foundation got in touch and their intervention changed everything. They had the money to help is and they had the expertise too.\"The foundation is full of good people who immediately recognised the need. The food parcel programme was organised quickly and efficiently.\"The foundation, supported by the club, moved quickly to support those most in need, announcing pound, of support in April through its Football for Good Fund. That support grew through the crisis. Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation were immediately given pound, to support its work.With the initial crisis of hunger addressed, other more innovative plans took hold. More than  iPads have been distributed to those living on their own. \"We hope to raise money to provide more,\" says Mr Donald. He has he good grace to chuckle at the suggestion that is a novel way to invoke the mantra of ldquokeep taking the tablets but emphasises their importance.\"They do not only offer entertainment but a way to connect to the outside world,\" he says. A more traditional way is also employed to build a bridge between a vulnerable, shielding adult and the world beyond four walls. Volunteers call those in need.\"Some mornings I was on a downer,\" says Betty Satti. lsquoThen the phone would ring and it was Mitch, the volunteer who calls me. There would be a lsquoHow are you  Anything you are needing rsquo That lted me. It showed there were other people out there who cared. It was not just a brief call. He would talk for  minutes and I felt there was a genuine concern for what I was feeling and what I was finding dficult.\"My sons are great.

The calls helped fill that as did the tablet. It sounds daft but the wee game of communal bingo on the tablet every Tuesday really raised the spirits. All that kept me going. When you are on you own, your mind wanders. You think: lsquoHow long is this going on rsquo The days become weeks, then months. It is dficult.rsquoThen it was over. \"I went out my front door on Wednesday,\" says Betty. \"My carer took me shopping and it was wonderful.

But you miss it terribly, even just watching people walking about. You get depressedyou donrsquot see people. It was good to be back among people again.\"There is a pause then she adds: \"I am so grateful. I have a wonderful family but isnrsquot it great when people help you when they donrsquot have to or need to \"She adds: ldquoI have never know this. It is something I will never forget.

She is no stranger to hard times or moments that test the will or sap the physical strength of even the strongest but the coronavirus posed a dferent problem.\"It is hard to describe precisely,\" she says. \"But is a mental thing. The reality of not being able to touch anyone. Not being able to hug the ones you love. Not to have people in your house. It was a terrible sensation of being locked in not just locked down.\"She pays tribute to her family but is also grateful to Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. \"They helped provide a leline to the outside world,\" she says. \"I am used to being on my own and quite happy normally in my own company. But this was dferent. I found the tablet particularly helpful. It was a pleasant and useful distraction.\"Nancy lives in sheltered housing near the city centre and also grasped an opportunity to express her gratitude. \"I believe I am luckier than most,\" she says. \"In my block of flats there are  tenants and  of them have no one. No one. Now that is sad and it must be very dficult.\"She believes this is when Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation became not only helpful but essential. \"The people there are truly caring,\" she says. \"I tell you what I mean by this. There is a lot of talk about helping. But they made sure you were all right. They talked to you. They did something. Actions. They came along with the tablet, they called you.\"There is an uplt when you connect with the outside world. It comes when my grandchildren send me a text at night and when my children call me. Grandchildren are a godsend and you miss them dreadfully. We need that human touch.\"There is nothing that can replace that when you are distanced from those you love but those outside that circle can offer something . You need to know there is somebody out there who cares, not because you are a grandmother or a mother but simply because you are a human being.Nancy, too, found something of good to take from a period of her le that she admits caused her fear.ldquoI learned to appreciate what I had, she says. ldquoI learned to appreciate the love I received, whether it was from family, my circle of friends or from Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. It is important to know somebody out there cares for you.The conversation ended with Nancy offering her good wishes.

But I believe schools should ldquosqueeze the brake pedal before reverting to the way things were in February. We have a golden opportunity to change our rigid education system.I donrsquot propose a complete abandonment of exams, timetables and classrooms, but I believe we have a duty to ask whether we can evolve the education system to better prepare pupils for an unknown future.Last year, our school built the UKrsquos first Innovation School, NuVu. There, pupils collaborate on developing creative solutions for real-world social and environmental problems. This supplementary method of learning challenges the Scottish Government by providing an example of how a new national curriculum could look.In March, the innovation school hatched a spinout, ViseUp, a collaboration between Kelvinside Academy and businesses across Scotland, which used the schoolrsquos D modelling software, D printers and laser cutters to provide PPE for frontline staff.For all that agility, we ndash just like every school ndash were unprepared for a pandemic. We learned valuable lessons and are still working to answer a litany of dficult questions of ourselves, our school and the entire system.Does being taught passively by a teacher in a classroom serve pupils  They are digital natives and wersquove been given a passport into their world. We must map out terrain to stay there. Especially as wersquove broken through the teething pains ndash particularly the overwhelming flood of gs during every online lesson.On Microsoft Teams, pupils have lsquopermissionrsquo to ask what they deem ldquostupid questions, away from judgment by their peers, without the formality of email. Often those questions are the gateway to true breakthroughs. How can we make sure pupils continue to feel secure enough to ask those questions in the classroom As businesses across the world debate whether or not toto the office, we will explore how we can adopt elements of blended learning which serve pupils preparing to enter a world moving away from an office-based -, with increased flexibility, and increased personal responsibility.Witnessing the pupils who have thrived during lockdown has been a wake-up call. We must make sure these pupils continue to thrive when school s. Part of this will be continuing to prioritise inidual feedback on a task by task basis, even in the cut and thrust of the classroom.Pupils have been consumed by two stories the pandemic and the social justice movement. We were able to adapt to make space to explore these issues and the level of engagement was inspiring. Can we be agile enough to always put current issues at the heart of the curriculum Finally, we must ask how we can make sure therersquos a quick and easy switch to home learningschools must close again.If educators go back to the way things were, we will fail our pupils. What will allow us to answer these questions is empathy and openness. We must be open to transformation and empathetic to pupils and teachers as we navigate our uncertain future.For all the questions and for all the debate about what pupils have lost, we are certain about what the most valuable skill pupils can have when they leave school, and itrsquos resilience. This test has prepared pupils better than any classroom lesson could.Deborah Gallacher is head of Guidance and PSE at Kelvinside Academy and a committee member of the Scottish Guidance Association"},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-ordered-tailors-stop-making-jacket-finding-buttons-werent-scotland","story":"And now it can be revealed that Prince Charles really does give more than two buttons about supporting the countryrsquos craftspeople.For he has insisted that even the tiniest part of his iconic Scottish attire must be home-sourced ndash after the heir to the throne rejected stag horn buttons from Austria for his kilt jacket and matching waistcoat.Instead, they had to be Scottish, he said.After a hunt, John Sugden, owner of Campbellrsquos of Beauly ndash which made the striking attire ndash managed to find good Scottish stag buttons to sow on to the stunning khaki green, faint houndstooth pattern tweed, which has an orange window pane check.ldquoThe prince had chosen the tweed himself. It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry. Many of these courses are delivered in the estatersquos textile training entre, located in the old sawmill at Dumfries House where the foundation is based.Programmes range from one-day workshops for school pupils to in-depth training programmes producing garments for the luxury fashion market. Supporters of the programme including major retailers and brands such as Yoox, Net-a-Porter, Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane.Campbellrsquos, which holds a royal warrant from the Queen, also supplies the RoyalHousehold and makes all the tweed outfits for Balmoral Estate.Over the years, the company has also supplied the Queen Mother and the Duke of Windsor. Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price. You have to change the psyche of young people.ldquoWhat the prince is doing at Dumfries House is amazing and leading the way in saving our traditional crafts. It is offering youngsters the opportunity and pathway to be part of the future of Britainrsquos textile industry. Without his initiative and raising awareness there is a real danger we could lose these old skills.It is not the first time the prince has publicly backed buying British. During a visit in  to the Isle of Harris distillery in the Outer Hebrides, Charles, known as Lord of the Isles, asked why its pound gin drinking glasses were made in Poland.The Isle of Harris distilleryrsquos gin is contained in distinctive bottles made in Yorkshire by specialist manufacturer Stolzle Glass Group. ldquoThey couldnrsquot do both  asked the prince. It was explained to the prince that they could not.Polish-born Peter Kwasniewski, the Tarbert-based distilleryrsquos shop manager, said afterwards:We tried in the UK to find a handmade glass that could match the pattern of our bottles.

I donrsquot think that he has really thought this through, though.Aside from the ridiculous assertion that he will one day be First Minister, has he not realised that continuing to run the line at Scottish football matches would mean that the new leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party would, in fact, be facing the general public This is something that no Conservative leader does any more, that isthey ever did. Running the line at football matches was previously okay for him because he was a complete and utter nonentity unknown completely to the general and footballing public, but it will not be the case now.I now look forward to his public footballing appearances in the former industrial heartlands of Central Scotland decimated by the very people he venerates. However, fair play to himhe does turn out and I look forward to see his appearances at such places as Motherwell, Falkirk and Dundee. Perhaps he will hold public question and answer sessions after the matches.What he will do, though, is have football chairmen up and down the country rubbing their hands in anticipation of adding a few thousand supporters on to their gates every week. When the wider Yes movement and the grass roots football fans realise that he will continue to run the line at Scottish football matches and with thousands deprived of Yes marches to go on, attendance at Douglas Ross football matches could become a new raison drsquoecirctre for lots of Scots he could possibly single-handedly save Scottish football, filling stadiums week in week out.However much as it would be entertaining to see him continue as a football linesman I fear his bosses in London will put a block on the continuation of his refereeing career. He could, of course, ask the Scottish footballing authorities to install outdoor fridges along the touchlines thus allowing him to continue his career.Andrew J Beck, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.A QUESTION for an SNP MP to ask at Prime Ministers Questions: \"On behalf of those too young to vote last time, what measures does the UK PMs chief adviser, Baron Cummings of Barnard Castle, recommend to ensure that Vlad the Bad does not interfere with the  Holyrood election \" Im trying to explore the limits of a UK PMs power.

More than , have been rescued from the Channel this year. Asylum seekers should claim sanctuary in the first \"safe haven\" they enter in Europe. They do not and are therefore illegal immigrants. They are predominantly young men who will get accommodation, food and other benefits. Britain should tell France that unless they stop the immigrant flow we will ban all imports from France and suggest that British holidaymakers avoid France.The SNPs shadow minister for immigration Stuart McDonald said the rhetoric around immigration is \"toxic\" and based on \"inherent xenophobia\".

Is she \"furious\" ndash as many Scots are ndash when she realises that these migrants have come through countriesravaged by Covid - yet are being accepted into our country with little or no check on them When shes not sobbing does our First Minister ever experience guilt or shame at having sent out her cry for \"more immigrants\" and calling anyone who expressed concern at this folly \"racist\" I doubt it. Her tear ducts may be working ndash but her conscience isnt. And yet, she gets kudos and acclaim from sections of the media for her \"competent\" and \"robust\" handling of the Covid crisis.Eight football players made her cry.

It wasnrsquot stalker anthem \"Every Breath You Takersquorsquo by The Police either.The song that had Russell Brand so worried is called WAP, by Black superstar rapper Cardi B, featuring Megan Thee Stallion.Back before Brand was trying desperately to style himself as a Dalai Lama for the online age, he loved women to express their sexuality. At least, he did when that expression of sexuality involved him.In a video entitled \"WAP with Cardi B  Megan Thee Stallion: Feminist Masterpiece or Porn rsquorsquo Russell Brand tries his best to get to the bottom of all this misogyny stuff. He wants to know who is to blame and why women arenrsquot as good at feminism as he is.There is data that suggests women will only apply for a jobthey meet  per cent of the criteria whereas men applythey meet %.The fact that Russell Brand feels qualied to lecture women on feminism in a -minute monologue really brings this statistic to le.Brand dedicated more time and energy on \"the emergent polemic around the use of sexual imagery and female potencyrsquorsquo than he did on his first we Katy Perry, whom he famously asked for a orce via text message, minutes before she was due on stage to perform.Aacute la Carrie Bradshaw, Brand couldnrsquot help but wonder: \"Do women achieve equality by aspiring to and replicating the values that have been established by males rsquorsquoIn other words,female artists sing about their sexuality, dress sexy and sing provocative lyrics, arenrsquot they just as bad as men who objecty them To illustrate his point, Russell Brand used the example of Margaret Thatcher. Incidentally, I expectBrand had been challenged to name another famous woman from history, he would have had to concentrate really hard before coming up with \"the Queenrsquorsquo.Getting to the crux of his argument, he declared that Margaret Thatcher was more of a \"woman-manrsquorsquo because she was \"a very powerful personrsquorsquo but didnrsquot do much to advance womenrsquos equality. So thatrsquos one thing they have in common.He goes on to say that Thatcher didnrsquot possess \"conventional female valuesrsquorsquo. According to Brand, those values are \"nurture, care, equalityrsquorsquo. Quelle surprise.Some lefty men relish a discussion about how women are their own worst enemy in the fight for equality. If yoursquove ever been cornered by one at a party, yoursquoll know what I mean. They \"gently suggest\" thatwomen were quieter, nicer and covered up moregender inequality would magically disappear.When discussing how women should react to systemic inequality: the gender pay cap male violence against women female genital mutilation lack of representation in places of power, these men are full of ideas.When challenged on their own behaviour or activism they are not so keen to chat. They reply indignantly that they would NEVER rape a woman and then look around for somebody to present them with a \"Male Feminist\" certicate.Itrsquos no surprise that Russell Brand used the work of black women in his monologue about the oversexualisation of women.Black womenrsquos bodies are hypersexualised and black women are subject to the racist \"Jezebelrsquorsquo trope. It is very telling that Brand finds the black women who had control over their depiction of female sexuality such a cause for concern.It was all just a bit too lewd and in-your-face for the newly-conservative Russell Brand who said the music video gave him a feeling that \"wasnrsquot particularly distinct from what I would get watching more conventional erotic contentrsquorsquo.PerhapsRussell Brand spent less time watching \"erotic contentrsquorsquo and lecturing women about feminism he might have more time to look after his children.He has admitted in the past that his we does most of the parenting. Our new feminist saviour doesnrsquot often have sole charge of his children because he is \"ineptrsquorsquo and has too much of a \"romantic and reflective dispositionrsquorsquo to bother with childcare.If Russell Brand is genuinely concerned about womenrsquos inequality then a good place to start might be to change some nappies.

Thatrsquos not in any way what the SQA are doing. What they are looking at is the comparison of assessment of performance or estimation of performance with final performance.But a document outlining the approach it was takingfrom the SQA clearly contradicted this.In a portion related to the awarding of results, it said that schools and colleges would provide them with their estimates of the grades, bands and rank order for each learner, for each course at National , Higher and Advanced Higher.\"We will then check and validate that information. We will moderate it,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and with results from previous years,\" it said.\"We will use the information from these estimates, in addition to prior learner attainment, where this is available. For example,learners achieved National  or Higher courses, in a previous year.\"We will also look at schoolsrsquo and collegesrsquo previous history of estimating and attainment in each subject and level. We may moderate these estimates, up or down,that is required.\"In further guidance it said that the moderation would \"ensure consistency across centres and fairness to candidates. This will include analyses of centresrsquo estimates and outcomes, prior attainment, progression statistics, and grade distributions.\"Scotlands biggest teaching union EIS said there was a \"bigger question\" to be asked about changing the system that \"routinely disregards\" teachers assessments.It said the current \"high stakes assessment system\" regularly fails children through operating \"notional quotas\" for the awarding of As, Bs, and Cs. It said they \"inevitably\" impact most on pupils on the cusp of achieving pass grades, the majority of whom are more likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds\".The union believes that planning for next years exams \"on the basis of business as usual\" appeared \"woefully complacent\".It said this needs to \"be addressed urgently\" through a review.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said the concern surrounds that fact the SQA assessments which hit pupils in disdvantaged areas happens every year, although normally they are founded on exam results rather than teachers estimates as in this pandemic-hit year.\"Every year pupils on the cusp of passes are potentially pushed into a lower category,\"he said.\"Returning to the injustice aspect ndashteachers have classroom evidence over the course of a year which indicates pupils ability and competence at a certain level but a high stakes exam system routinely disregards that ndash is that fair \"Based on this yearrsquos outcry, most people would say not.\"Barry Black, a researcher at the University of Glasgow specialising in educational inequality, said it had been clear from the start that the SQA moderation would further disadvantage already disadvantaged young people - and said there should be a rethink for next year.\"This whole process has been one that brought about signicant levels of uncertainty,\" he said.\"It is more frustrating as it could have been avoided from the start had the SQA and Scottish Government listened to the warnings from Parliament, experts and academics from as early as April which continued through the summer.\"He said there was scope for an alternative assessment model which would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils.A range of options open to the SQA included the collection and submission of evidence of pupilsrsquo work, which \"could have been a system that was fairer to the inidual students, rather than the system wide statistical moderation that was used\".He added: \"The changes announced earlier this week to accept all teacher estimates would not make for an ideal alternative methodthey were planned from the start, but are fairer than the methodology that was used. It will be of huge relief to the impacted young people and it is a welcome change.ldquoAn urgent review is the right thing, including looking at the role of assessment more generally, especially since we know that there is an even bigger risk of a hugely widened attainment gap in the next school year.\"An analysis from the Equality Impact Assessment, reveals that the  estimate from students in the most deprived areas was at an .% pass rate but the actual result reduced that number down to .%. A . percentage point reduction. For pupils from the richest areas, the  pass rate estimate was at .% with the actual result at .%, a . percentage point reduction.The changes announced on Tuesday mean that this years Higher pass rate will now sit at .%, up . percentage points on , while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at .%, up . points from the previous year.But Mr Swinney in apologising, continued to insist that young people from deprived backgrounds had not in fact been disadvantaged by the SQA methodology that was used.He focused on the overall pass rate which he said had increased by . per cent among pupils in the most disadvantaged communities, while it rose by . per cent among pupils in the least deprived communities.While the education secretary has apologised for what happened, the SQA has so far failed to.Mr Swinney made it clear on Tuesday that he was not criticising the SQA saying it undertook the task \"that I set and did so in good faith\" and said he was \"grateful...for the professional approach that they have taken\".The chief executive of Scotlands qualications authority Fiona Robertson insisted it had done its best to carry out the instructions of the Scottish Government.She had told Holyroods education committee on Wednesday that she was \"keenly aware of the strength of feeling\" about the results - but said it felt \"essential\" to \"maintain standards\" between dferent schools and years.She said the SQA treated teacher estimates with \"utmost respect\", but there was a \"clear and unequivocal case for some moderation\" because they were \"not always accurate\".Mr Swinney has said on Tuesday that the SQA action \"emphasised heavily the importance of maintaining standards from previous years to this year\".But he said he had changed his mind after listening to the \"heartfelt pleas\" and \"anguish\" from young people who had been affected.An independent review is to be led by Professor Mark Priestley of the University of Stirling.An initial report is expected within five weeks.A Scottish Government spokesman said. ldquoAfter listening to the concerns of young people, Ministers are clear that there was a risk of young people from working class backgrounds, and others, losing faith in the education system and the value of their hard work. That is why the Education Secretary has apologised and taken action to ensure that education can still be seen as a route out of poverty.ldquoWe have taken the decision to rely on teacher judgement as the basis for this yearrsquos qualications, but are also clear that this year is and must be seen as unique and cannot be compared to previous years and nor can it set an automatic precedent for future years.ldquoWe have already commissioned an independent review of Curriculum for Excellence, and we will work with them on extending the remit of this review to include recommendations on how to transform the Scottish approach to assessment and qualications, based on best practice globally.Barry Black analysis in fullI think there is a really interesting question in the data from results day around why professional teacher judgement - which we put so much onus on in Scotland - is seemingly at odds with the results an exam model would expect to produce. That is why a review into the role of assessment more generally is encouraging.Ideally there would be some level of moderation within any alternative assessment model.Ideally, this would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils and not the historical attainment of pupilrsquos schools - which is where the issues we saw stemmed from, and what were warned about and against. As for next year, I think the potential for more disruption this school year needs to be considered ahead of the assessment diet. It also needs to factor in that those sitting qualications have already lost class time before the summer, and that lockdown will have almost certainly impacted upon attainment and the attainment gap signicantly.The moderation process was explicitly designed to replicate consistent results with previous exam diets, and produced wholly dferent results to the teachers estimation. Which brings about the questionwe currently assess in the best way to reflect young peoplersquos abilities.What the SQA tried to do with moderation, as they have set out, was maintain what they would describe as national standards in the assessment system this year - broadly seeking to get consistent results with previous years exam diets. That is why the predominant feature of their methodology was tolerance levels of grades at a school based on results it had achieved previously.To all intents and purposes, their moderation aimed to pattern what would happen in a normal year. But such statistical system-wide adjustments were always destined to impact more disadvantaged inidual students the most.Plainly, although exam results are socially patterned in normal years, iniduals still have control over the process - through coursework and exams. This year they clearly didnrsquot have that, and were assessed not by their inidual performance, but the past performance of their school.Thatrsquos why the interesting question around teacher judgement being seemingly at odds with what an exam diet would expect predict to happen arises."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11704186.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-complicit-slavery-long-act-union-says-academic","story":"Professor David Worthington, a reader in history at the University of Highlands and Islands, has been involved in researching Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade pre-.He found evidence Scots were involved in several European markets in countries, including the Netherlands, that had links to South American plantations that recruited African and indigenous slaves.While recent condemnation has focused on major cities and the statues of iniduals who profited from colonialism, he says merchants from rural parts of Scotland, including the Highlands were also profiting from lucrative sugar plantations owned by slavers, decades before.: Plaques on Scotlands statues do not go far enough, says anti-racism groupHe said: ldquoItrsquos fascinating to take itback to the s, which often people donrsquot do, and to see that these entanglements have deep roots.ldquoIf we go back before the Anglo Scottish Union of  ndash which is such a feature of our lives ndash I think people would often think Scottish involvement in the slave trade would be in connection with the British Empire, which is when Scots have the chance to be involved in the overseas empire.ldquoOf course Scotland had its own empire before  with the Darien project [an unsuccessful attempt to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia, a colony on the Isthmus of Panama, in the late ] but the involvement of people in Scotland in the slave trade was not actually dependant on the Union.ldquoThere were several overseas empires which were very happy to engage in slavery and thatrsquos something that we have to consider.One of the main trade centreswas a Dutch colony in Rotterdam,says Mr Worthington but records of Scots involved at that timeare scare.: Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: Thebrutal truth of Scotlands slaving pastHe said: ldquoI think theywere a bit more slippery. The numbers arenrsquot that great from the Highlands but they were exploiting the fact they were on the margins.In the period before the th century, Mr Worthington says Scots travelling abroad were more likely to go toa European country than North America, which led to imperial connections.The key industries, pre , were tobacco and sugar and it was not uncommon, he says, for Dutch merchants to trade sugar for horses, which were shipped to plantations in South America.He said: ldquoWe think of the tobacco lords of Glasgow and rightly so because they have left a massive imprint on the city but the involvement of sugar in slavery tends not to get as much attention and that was happening very early.ldquoThe whole system in the Highlands of importing sugar was distinct and I noticed when I was looking at the customs records for Inverness the majority of shipping and shipments were coming from Rotterdam.: Pheona Matovu: To abolish slavery in Scotland we need to address the structures that perpetuate itldquoThat made me think, where were they coming from to get to Rotterdam because obviously the Dutch werenrsquot growing sugar cane.ldquoThe Dutch were expanding their colonial enterprise in the th century and led me to think about the major sugar producing plantation in the Dutch colonies at that time, whichwas Suriname. I saw a map from  and there were Scots names onthe plantation.ldquoThere were two names that looklike Dutch versions of Highland namesndash Magalfin and Macferson.Mr Worthingtonrsquos research led him to Henry MacIntosh, who came from Borlum, on the shores of Loch Ness and was one of the biggest sugar planters from the Highlands.He said: ldquoIn  he acquired a plantation with a man called William Pringle in Dutch Suriname.ldquoThey had  slaves, but within years the number of slaves had gone up to . \"They were mostly African but a small number were indigenous.Mr WorthingtonDavid wanted to find out how common sugar was in the Highlands at this time and says itsuse was more widespread than he had anticipated.He said: ldquoI found that a lot of sugar was coming into the highlands at this time. In the lowlands it was sent to sugar refineries, there were two on the Clyde and one in Edinburgh.ldquoIn the highlands it was just being taken direct from the Netherlands.ldquoIt was certainly coming into places like Glasgow and Leith in large quantities too.ldquoWe often think of the diet as being very basic in the highlands and that was probably the case but there are even references to sugar in the Western Isles at this time.\"Tea was becoming very fashionable and putting sugar in your tea was something that was marketed.ldquoIt was a prized commodity and there was a lot of crime around it.ldquoThere was a case of a guy being put to death in Inverness for stealing sugar. They were importing these liquorice products and sugar candy and bizarrely named confections.After the Act of Union, Scotland began to import its sugar from the British Empire., from areas including Barbados and the West Indies.ldquoSugar has seeped across the whole of Northern Europe by , itrsquos a part of peoplesrsquo diet and thatrsquos quite sinister in a way. You couldnrsquot describe it as addictive but itrsquos very hard to stop once you start.Mr Worthington said he hopes to travel to Suriname to fill in the gaps of his research ndash crucially, the voices of the workers who were exploited to satisfy the palates of sweet-toothed Scots.He said: ldquoOne of the things that disturbs me about doing this is that I donrsquot have the perspective of the slaves.ldquoI have not been to Suriname but I really want to and itrsquos terrible that we donrsquot have the perspective of those people who were exploited by these iniduals.\"People in Scotland were complicit in this.

The independence movement is bigger than any politician, bigger than any split and certainly bigger than the SNP and should the SNP ship ever become holed below the waterline, there is an ample supply of leboats in the waiting.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.YOUR Saturday columnist Struan Stevenson this week holds forth on economics and politics . If, like me, your readers were hoping for cogent analysis and logical thinking they would have been disappointed.His theme is SNP grievance, but Mr Stevensonrsquos article is redolent with his own grievance that by some inexplicable paradox, support for both the SNP and independence is steadily rising while all around, all he sees is failure and despair.He berates SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford for taunting him with the mantra of ldquotoo wee, too poor, too stupid. However, he then attempts, with the aid of some dubious back of an envelope calculations, to demonstrate that Scotland is essentially bankrupt, unable to support a currency or public services and unable to achieve equivalence with countries such as Ireland or Denmark. He opines we are so economically toxic that Scotland would be shunned by the EU.Does Mr Stevenson really believe that  And,he does, is it a good reason for persisting with a -year-old Union which has left us in such penury He then recycles the tired arguments of Better Together circa . Discovering oil was an economic disaster, Scotlandrsquos deficit is the largest in Europe, we are totally dependent on the largesse of London and so on. For Mr Stevenson and those of his ilk, any thought of constitutional change can only be measured against the yardstick of his version of economics. Itrsquos all about bawbees and siller in your pocket, especiallyyoursquore a higher rate taxpayer.The answer to his paradox, of course, is not to be found in balance sheets or economic statistics. Itrsquos staring him in the face. Since  Scotland has voted decisively against Brexit and three Tory governments, yet all have been imposed by the Union. Thatrsquos where the grievance lies and thatrsquos the reason for the increasing support for the SNP and Independence.Iain Gunn, Elgin.STRUAN Stevenson states that it would ldquocost around pound billion to establish our own currency. He has, however, got it this the wrong way round.To put  billion Scots Pounds into circulation, you take in pound billion Sterling in exchange. This forms the reserve as backing for the Scots currency, although I would suggest that some of the Sterling be sold in exchange for gold and or dollars, since Sterling is a very weak currency, and the Scots pound would be stronger. The reason for this is that the UK has, for a good number of years, been running a trade deficit, usually at least pound billion annually, whereas Scotland has, since records began, always shown a balance of trade surplus, currently around pound billion a year.Older readers like me will remember the post-war mantra ldquoexport or die, the IMF bail-out when James Callaghan was Chancellor and the conditions imposedand the fall of Sterling from the post-war  to the pound to . to the pound now.Since the last world war, about  countries have become independent. Nearly all established their own currency very quickly with no fuss, little expense, and a lot of advantages.But maybe Mr Stevenson would have preferred to stay with the Titanic rather than risk a leboat.Ian Macdonald, Bearsden.STRUAN Stevenson repeats the mantra about Scotlandrsquos ldquodeficit, ignoring as usual that, whatever this figure is supposed to actually represent, it is mostly generated as a result of mismanaged fiscal powers reserved by the UK Government. The Scottish Government, allowed very limited fiscal freedoms, balances its budget every year. When was the last time the UK managed to do this  Elsewhere he refers to Scotlandrsquos Covid- death rate being higher than Norwayrsquos, a unionist deceit since, again, it was the delayed, incompetent deployment of powers reserved to the UK Government that resulted in the unnecessary deaths of our fellow Scots.These are but two typical examples of the flimsiness of the unionist cause. Bereft of any vision for Scotland , Mr Stevenson and his diminishing parcel of rogues can do nothing to resist the inevitable demise of this corrupt, decaying facade of a Union and the prospect of an liberated, independent Scotland being welcomed warmly back among its friends in the EU.Charles Shaw, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrattempts to take Dr Gerald Edwards to task for his letter of August  implying that democracy had been denied when the Greens voted with the Government to defeat the no confidence motion raised against the Education Secretary.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide. All of this is built on the learnings from trials undertaken as part of G RuralFirst, a Cisco-led DCMS G Trials and Testbed programme.Chief Executive, Cisco UK  Ireland, David Meads, said: “Our findings with G RuralFirst revealed that over a ten-year period, the UK’s rural economy could grow by an additional £ bngood quality G services were accessible.“We believe that by taking advantage of neutral hosting technologies, fixed wireless access and spectrum sharing, we will be able to allow third parties – including local businesses and communities – to build and own radio infrastructure, as well as work with mobile network operators to reduce costs and make rural coverage commercially sustainable.”Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Warman, said: #We are making sure the UK#s rural communities aren’t left behind in the digital age and are investing record amounts to improve connectivity in the least connected parts of the country.“G New Thinking is part of our £ million programme to help the countryside capitalise on new ways of using next generation G technology and I look forward to seeing how rural communities will benefit.#The project is expected to go live later in  and to conclude in .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is why I have taken this decision today.The Stormont Assembly will be recalled from summer recess on Tuesday to debate the furore caused by the centralised formula designed to rule out anomalies caused by inidual schools or teachers.Standardisation aims to avoid a case where a school could give all of its pupils unrealistic marks.Mr Weir had previously argued that using grades predicted by teachers could undermine their credibility since historically those had been over-optimistic.On Monday, he said he had instructed the CCEAthat all of their AS and A-level qualications will now be awarded the higher of the grade submitted by their school or centre or the grade calculated by the CCEA.He said the organisation was working to release the revised results to candidates as quickly as possible.The minister made the announcement hours after saying GCSEs would be based solely on teacher predictions.I welcome that the Education Minister will now respect professional judgement of teachers in predicting AS  A-Level gradesStandardisation was flawed from beginning and should never have been usedMany students have been through a tough number of daysToday is a win for themmdash Michelle OrsquoNeillAugust , Robert Wilson, Northern Ireland regional officer of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ldquoWe welcome the decision to put an end to the grading fiasco of using only standardised grades.He fully supported the ministerrsquos intention that young people in Northern Ireland are in no way disadvantaged in comparison to their peers where.Stormont Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill said: ldquoI welcome that the education minister will now respect the professional judgment of teachers in predicting AS and A-level grades.ldquoStandardisation was flawed from the beginning and should never have been used.ldquoMany students have been through a tough number of days.ldquoToday is a win for them.NUS-USI studentsrsquo union president Ellen Fearon said the decision was a huge relief to students who have faced months of uncertainty already.She added: ldquoThis victory belongs to students who would not accept their futures being decided by an unjust algorithm. vw,vw,px, px\"Zara Meadows, from Belfast grammar school Belfast Royal Academy, said teachers had been demonised Zara Meadows, from Belfast grammar school Belfast Royal Academy, is an AS-level student.She attended a protest in Belfast city centre outside the Education Authority on Monday afternoon andsaid the change of heart was a welcome one.Zara said: ldquoThere is a real demonisation of teachers which is disgusting.ldquoThat needs to change.A CCEA statement said: ldquoThe Minister of Education, Peter Weir MLA, has decided that AS and A Level qualications will now be awarded the higher of either the grades submitted by their school or college or the statistically standardised outcome awarded by CCEA on  August . This is in line with the position in England and Wales.ldquoAs directed by the minister, we will work as quickly as possible to confirm the results with schools and colleges. We will also update the information shared with UCAS IUA, with any urgent cases prioritised.ldquoWe are working through other details, including the appeals process, and will provide updates as soon as information becomes available.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

This is why I have taken this decision today, he said.“In the challenging situation in which we find ourselves, there are no perfect solutions. Students would have preferred to have taken their exams, but that was simply not possible in the circumstances. There is no substitute for exams themselves and recent events highlight the need for a full-timeto education, five days a week.Mr Weir thanked teachers and pupils for their hard work during the Covid- pandemic.Read More Gavin Williamson apologises after U-turn over A-level resultsThe CCEA has released a statement saying they will work as quickly as possible to confirm A level results with schools and colleges.As directed by the Minister, we will work as quickly as possible to confirm the results with schools and colleges. We will also update the information shared with UCAS   IUA, with any urgent cases prioritised. We are working through other details, including the appeals process, and will provide updates as soon as information becomes available, the statement read.The CCEA said that GCSE results will be released as scheduled on Thursday  August .The news has been welcomed across the political spectrum, however SDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the Education Minister should now apologise to teachers and pupils for the stress the situation has caused.“While I welcome the eventual positive result, I do deeply regret the anxiety and distress this has caused for our young people over the last number of days. It was unnecessary and highly unfair, he said.The Education Minister should offer a full and genuine apology, to our young people for causing this distress and to our teachers, for the way their professional judgement was cast aside.”“The minister should compel CCEA to publish the algorithm that was used. It is critical lessons are learnt from this debacle so no student is forced to ensure this stress in the future.”Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan said the decision by the minister was the only sensible response to the problem. “Minister Weir should have taken the action earlier and on the merits of the arguments rather than waiting on the approach of ministers in London, she added.“The delay in changing this process has served only to compound the stress and and anxiety experienced by our students, their families and teachers. “I’m pleased that through cross-party co-operation and pressure from the Education Committee that we now have a positive outcome for our young people and that the right decision has finally been made.” Read More Students plan protest over Northern Ireland A-Level exams debacleUlster Unionist education spokesperson Robbie Butler question how long it has taken for the change to be announced.“However the question will be asked why did it have to be this way  This decision could have been made long before now, despite it being the only sensible option on the table. It`s very late in the day, he said.Students have been put through immense stress. Given that mental health is the number one issue for young people this has only piled misery upon misery. The system has failed them up until now. Now it needs to deliver. “Further questions arise such as how quickly can CCEA turn this around and get the regraded results out to the students affected  And what role are the universities going to carry out to play their part  They cannot close their eyes and ears to what is going on around them. There needs to be a collegiate approach to the solution for all students.”Earlier on Monday Peter Weir announced that GCSE results, due to be released on Thursday, will be based solely on teacher-assessed grades.The minister said he made the decision following advice from Northern Ireland#s exams board. the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessmentand having listened to the concerns of school leaders, teachers, parents and young people.Standardisation is normally a key feature of awarding qualications in Northern Ireland and across the UK, he added in a statement.“However, these are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly dficult decisions are made. I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.The standardisation system used by CCEA dfers for A-levels and GCSEs. The A-level model took into account pupils# previous exam results, while the GCSE model used the past perfomance of GCSE classes in the schools the pupils attended.When questioned as to why the new system announced for GCSEs cannot be applied to A-levels, Mr Weir said there is effectively an internal market for GCSEs in Northern Ireland, while more A-levels are set by outside bodies where in the UK, so there is a need to ensure there is comparability with the rest of the UK market.“We’ve got to ensure that whatever is happening in the wider context, particularly between ourselves, England and Wales, have a level of compatibility between each other, or we’re going to be advantaging some pupils at the expense of disadvantaging others, he told the BBC.“Clearly,a national decision was taken, I would want to make sure that our pupils are not disadvantaged and therefore I think that would lead inevitably to a level of change and I think that would also result in terms of the issue of comparability between those students who are doing English board examinations and Northern Ireland board examinations.So there’s got to be a very close link between what we do in Northern Ireland and what happens particularly at an English level.Belfast Related ContentEducationCarrick mum#s anger over impact of NI exams uncertainty on childrenThe chaos of the exam results has been twice as stressful for Carrickfergus mum-of-four Gillian Brownnutt .Education PremiumJamie HarkinOpinionFarcical exercise in statistics has put our futures at stakeDid Education Minister Peter Weir and Justin Edwards, who heads up the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment , study their model like I studied the A-level syllabus, often into the small hours every single evening EducationA-Level results: Devastated NI pupils look to appeal results decision Puplis and parents have demanded action after A-Level results left many students in limbo yesterday.EducationNI GCSEs students to be awarded grades predicted by teachersGSCE students in Northern Ireland are to be awarded the grades predicted by their teachers, Stormont’s Education Minister has announced..\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"GalleryEducation PremiumNorthern Ireland exams chaos heads for the courts as MLAs face recall from summer breakThe Education Minister is facing a High Court battle over the chaos being experienced by thousands of A-level students across Northern Ireland.

Now Foden plans to head to the same spot at Six Mile Water during the off-season and try his luck.Foden#s biggest catch was a lb catfish in Spain and Barry - a lelong Manchester United fan - said he would be happy to show the English U World Cup winner the best fishing spots along the Antrim river.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhil Foden in action for City FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhil Foden in action for CityFoden may be heading here a bit sooner than he#d hoped, after City#s Champions League dreams were ended by Lyon in Saturday night#s quarter-final.It finally brought their season to an end, with the players now free to enjoy some downtime before the action resumes in September.And according to sports website The Athletic, Foden is planning to head to Antrim to fish the same spot where the record trout was caught.Meanwhile, Barry, who is a member of the Antrim District Angling Association, promised thatFoden does come to Six Mile Water, he will not wear his United shirt.It has to be me to show him about the river after my catch, Barry said. I wouldn#t wear my United top buthe brought me a City top I#d maybe wear it just because it#s him.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBarry McGuigan with his monster catch on Six Mile Water FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBarry McGuigan with his monster catch on Six Mile WaterI wouldn#t be letting any pictures be taken because you know what football is like. I wouldn#t be changing from United.If he#s a fly-fishing man, it#s a great river to fish from. He#s maybe heard that this was a rare catch.He can give me a shout because I#ll guide him along the river.A lot of people don#t like to boast about our river because it#ll bring more people to it but I think it#s a great thing because it brings people to Antrim and it#s some good news.The Six Mile would probably be the best brown trout river in the UK.I fish in the river four nights a week. I went fishing one night last week at eight o#clock to about half-three but I didn#t get one bite.Recalling his record catch, Barry explained that wild brown trout would generally reach lb in a letime but to catch an lb specimen was a pretty special moment.Barry, who is a barber, was night fishing at his regular spot on July , with friends Rory Whiteand Neilson Wilson , when he caught the trout at am.The specimen weighed lb and was  inches in , which is a rare size and weight for a fish of its kind in its natural habitat. After posing for a photograph, Barry released it back into the water.That#s unheard of and there was one caught  years ago by a fella on a dferent river system and he has it stuffed in his living room, Barry added.This is a resident brown trout that lives in the river. It has obviously gone to Lough Neagh at some stage and has gotten bigger.There was one caught in Antrim  years ago about lb and it was in the fishing shop my whole le.My scales were a bit dodgy too, so mine may have even been bigger than lb!

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11691139.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
