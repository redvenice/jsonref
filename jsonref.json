With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended.\u0027The actor also stated that he did not assault any women, create an unsafe work environments or offer employment or advancement opportunities in exchange for sexual favors.That does not contradict the CNN report, in which one woman alleged that the actor tried to lift her skirt on set but most spoke of comments that Freeman made which made them feel uncomfortable including the reporter who wrote the story, Chloe Melas.She was six-months pregnant when she claims Freeman made a number of comments about her during an interview which she deemed inappropriate and told her supervisors about the following day. Freeman also said in his statement: \u0027I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday\u0027s media reports.\u0027 The accusations did not cause him to lose his role in The Poison Rose, but he was quickly dropped by Visa and as the voice of Vancouver\u0027s public transportation system.There has also been talk of the Screen Actor\u0027s Guild possibly taking away his lifetime achievement award.

I try to keep people equal. I’m a citizen of the globe. Division is a dangerous thing.\u0027Travolta has also been accused of sexual misconduct, but never charged and always denied those allegations.Two men sued Travolta in 2012 filing sexual battery lawsuits in court. The men, known as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2, where represented by Gloria Allred in the case.John Doe 1 claimed that Travolta groped him at the Beverly Hills Hotel in January 2012, the same month that John Doe 2 claimed the actor did the same at a hotel in Atlanta.According to court documents in the case of John Doe 2 \u0027Travolta suddenly turned on his stomach with his legs wide open with a full erection. He then tried to force Doe Plaintiff No. 2\u0027s hand on Travolta\u0027s scrotum.\u0027Then, Travolta started to grab, rub and caress Doe Plaintiff no. 2\u0027s upper thighs and buttocks.\u0027Travolta still had an erection and wanted his abdominals done, but Travolta\u0027s erection was in the way and he refused to have his penis covered by a sheet of a pillow case cover...Travolta started masturbating about 15 minutes left in the session, and Doe Plaintiff No. 2, said he had to go.\u0027John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 eventually dropped their suits without prejudice, with Allred saying at the time \u0027We believe that the lawsuit should be filed in another court and, therefore, the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice.\u0027We will be conferring with our client regarding what will happen next in this case.\u0027           Big night: Freeman and his girlfriend at the Screen Actor Guild Awards in January          Partner: Freeman and his partner Lori McCreary, who is the president of the Screen Actors GuildIn 2009, Travolta was also accused of sexual harassment by Royal Caribbean International employee Fabian Zanzi.In an Employee Discipline Form, which was obtained by TMZ, it claims \u0027According to his own statement, Fabian proceeded to a guest stateroom to deliver a room service order as instructed by his supervisor.\u0027While in the stateroom the guest invited Fabian to take a seat to talk for a few minutes.

Metaphors and hidden meanings had no place in a production that never stopped bellowing its messages in our faces. This might be the loudest piece of TV ever made.Emma Thompson (Goneril) screamed at her father’s army rabble till her veins popped. Emily Watson (Regan) shrieked fit to shatter glass as her fingernails dug out the eyes of the Duke of Gloucester (Jim Broadbent).Everybody tried to outshout everyone else, Hopkins loudest of all. He was never knowingly caught underacting, nor underdoing the symbolism of a broken Britain.The stormy heath that Shakespeare imagined for the king’s mad scenes became a refugee camp filled with starving immigrants, and then a concrete shopping centre in a soulless new town.Hopkins has wanted to make this TV version for a long time — so long that he once had a teenage Keira Knightley in mind for young Cordelia, instead of Florence Pugh. Now he’s finally brought it to the screen, the 80-year-old has been selling it for all he’s worth, even boasting (like Lear) of his real-life estrangement from his daughter.Some of the casting was inspired. Jim Carter, the eternal butler of Downton Abbey, was perfect as the loyal Kent, and Tobias Menzies (best-known as Black Jack Randall in Outlander) was wickedly nasty as the Duke of Cornwall.Menzies will play Prince Philip in the next series of The Crown, which doesn’t bode well for the Buckingham Palace spin doctors.Thank goodness for a writer who doesn\u0027t treat viewers like...Share this articleYet Christopher Ecclestone was an odd choice for Goneril’s effete footman, Oswald.

They have no values beyond money-grubbing and treat anyone who gets in their way with contempt.’Blackstone’s billionaire co-founder and chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, trousered a scarcely credible £572.4 million last year alone.His company tried to sell St Katharine Docks for £435 million in 2017, three years after acquiring it for £185 million.

Now, for the first time, we can reveal the true cost of paying in sterling overseas.Are you bills about to rise? Some energy customers face bill...My partner and I are planning a trip to Japan next spring,...Get more for your holiday money: The best debit and credit...Share this articleIn an experiment run by Starling Bank, identical twins Heidi and Alice, 29, travelled to Berlin for a weekend. They made exactly the same purchases and both used the same debit card, which charges no extra fees for spending abroad.The only difference was that each time they used their cards, Heidi paid in the local currency, euros, whereas Alice paid in pounds.          Alice (pictured above) and Heidi carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds           For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          The research showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550.Martyn James, a consumer expert who has worked for the Financial Ombudsman Service, says: ‘Insurance exists to cover you for the unexpected events that can occur in life.‘But Money Mail’s investigation has clearly shown that there are countless occasions when unclear or unfair contract terms are used to avoid paying out a claim — this practice undermines the whole industry.’An analysis of cases that went before the independent dispute service for insurance claims, the Financial Ombudsman, found that some insurers refuse to pay out when a burglar has not used ‘force and violence’ to gain entry to the customer’s property.It means that unless thieves break a window or kick down the door, insurers will reject claims — even if the customer had locked the doors and windows and the burglar picked the lock.          Obscure loopholes are being used by insurers to avoid paying out, our investigation has foundIn one case last year, Royal \u0026amp Sun Alliance (RSA) declined a couple’s home insurance claim after police said it was likely the burglars had used a skeleton key to get into the property, leaving no evidence of forced entry.A spokesman for RSA says: ‘In this instance, there was no settlement as the cover terms within the customer’s policy were not met by the claim.’Meanwhile, some insurers refuse claims if customers have the wrong type of locks on windows and doors. In February, for example, one man was refused a payout following a break-in because thieves entered a ground-floor window that was on a latch.His insurer, LV, claimed he had not complied with the security conditions of his policy, which stated that all his windows must have key-operated locks. A spokesman for LV says the requirement had been explained verbally and in the customer’s policy documents.Put your question to our team of independent experts. Click the more button to email usMoney Mail’s investigation also found that some motor insurers refuse to pay out if a customer’s car is stolen by a thief posing as a potential buyer, or if the spare key is kept in the car — even if it is locked out of sight.In a case referred to the Ombudsman, the thief posing as a buyer had asked the owner of the car if he could take it for a test drive. The owner refused and offered to drive himself.He later agreed to switch places with the ‘buyer’ but, as soon as he opened the door to get out, the thief made off with the car.When the owner reported the incident to his insurer, Advantage, his claim was rejected. The firm says that the policy excluded cover for ‘loss or damage to your car where possession of it is gained by deception of someone who claims to be a buyer or agent’.Travel insurers, meanwhile, may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’. In one case, a man was told by a doctor that he needed surgery after snapping a tendon in his heel while on holiday.However, his insurer, Aviva, said that it didn’t think it was ‘medically necessary’ to have the surgery abroad and wanted to repatriate him back to the UK for treatment. When he went ahead with the operation regardless, Aviva refused to cover the cost.          Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550Aviva says that its travel insurance policies only cover treatment overseas if it cannot wait until the customer returns to the UK and that this is detailed in the policy terms and conditions.It adds that it had paid to get the customer home after the surgery. Martyn James says: ‘It isn’t right that customers are expected to challenge a medical professional when they are distressed and in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language.’Travel and health insurers may also refuse claims if they discover customers have not declared GP visits and physio appointments — even if they occurred years ago and the customer was never diagnosed with a condition.In one case seen by the Ombudsman, a man was refused cover after he was admitted to hospital with severe back pain caused by an extruded disc hernia. Axa discovered that he had been to his GP with back and leg pain two months prior to travelling.Yet, despite the fact that he was only told to take over-the-counter medication and to self-refer for physiotherapy, Axa said he was not covered for claims arising from any medical condition for which he’d been prescribed medication or received treatment within six months of booking the trip.However, the Ombudsman said that it was not reasonable for Axa to expect the customer to notify his insurer of the GP visit when he had not experienced a significant change in health.Axa says it accepted the ruling and has paid the claim. Some travel insurers also try to reject claims where the customer has had alcohol, even though the incident was unrelated. And others will use completely unrelated health issues or injuries to avoid paying out.In one instance, a woman had failed to declare a trip to the GP about pins and needles 14 years before she was being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.When she made a claim on her critical illness policy, her insurer, Prudential, turned it down on the grounds of ‘non-disclosure’, as pins and needles can be an early symptom of the condition.But the insurer was later ordered by the Ombudsman to pay out.Prudential says it is ‘extremely rare’ for it not to pay a critical illness claim and adds that it is sorry for the distress caused.James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says: ‘It seems that, as the pressure to set fairer prices increases, insurers are trying to reduce costs by wriggling out of as many claims as possible. Examples such as these, where insurers reject claims on a technicality, are toxic.‘Firms should be forced to flag major exclusions in big red letters before customers sign up.’A spokesman for industry trade body the Association of British Insurers says: ‘Insurers want to pay all claims and continually strive to make all customer communications as clear and simple as possible.‘Insurance is ultra-competitive and, when shopping around, it is vital that people assess their needs and check the cover to ensure that it best meets their requirements.’ £43 for 18 monthsOne year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBCE1D900000578-5784335-image-a-37_1527627607984.jpg","title":"New York Times writer trolls Prescot Journalists article labels town casualty austerity","story":"    Prescot\u0027s new fire and police station.

About 15,000 people live in the area.Centuries ago, cotton was manufactured there, but the industry died out. There was also once a sail-cloth factory, and coal mines – which have all long closed.In 1840, the district was noted for its ‘superior construction of watch tools’, while clay in the area was used for coarse earthenware.Currently, Prescot is building a replica Elizabethan theatre, with 350 seats, as part of an array of projects in the town, which the local council will provide visitors with a ‘thriving attractive destination.

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent. So they had to think again.’Their solution was judicious and creative. Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.          Shirley said her life changed in December 2002 when she had a splitting headache and was unable to get out of bed because of vertigo‘I find joy in almost anything, no matter how small,’ she says. ‘And recently I’ve experienced the joy of watching my beloved Manchester City, who I’ve supported for 50 years, have such a record-breaking season.‘I’m very much a lady of leisure these days and, unless I’m going out, I spend much of the daytime at the computer, keeping in touch with friends and family by email or via Facebook, surfing the internet or watching TV.‘I like watching most sports, as well as historical documentaries and comedy. I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly. In fact, I only have to think of something funny and I start giggling.‘I’ve come to the conclusion,’ she adds, ‘that my brain’s default setting is happiness’ — and as I wave goodbye to her and turn to walk down the drive, once again I hear the glorious ripple of her laughter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/14/4CB208FD00000578-0-image-a-18_1527514498676.jpg","title":"Britains biggest beer festival offer alcohol free ales time history","story":"    A Dutch beer will be the first alcohol-free ale on sale at the Campaign for Real Ale’s Great British Beer Festival in AugustBraxzz Brewery has developed an alcohol-free IPA and the world’s first alcohol-free porter ale.Coca-Cola launches its first ever alcoholic drink: Fizzy...See what alcohol does to the heart: Shocking images show the...Share this articleFestival organiser Catherine Tonry said: “Alcohol-free beer has become increasingly important in recent years and thankfully brewers have been keeping pace with consumer demands. “There are now some fantastic innovations in the sector and a much wider range of styles and flavours than ever before.“We are thrilled to provide an alcohol-free alternative to festival-goers who cannot or choose not to drink.”          Festival organiser Catherine Tonry says alcohol-free beer has become increasingly popular with consumersJames Leary, of Braxzz, said: “We are delighted to be attending the Great British Beer Festival for hopefully the first of many appearances.“We hope to provide something different at the event and give another option to anybody who will not be drinking but still want to taste craft ale.” "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBCEA8F00000578-0-image-a-64_1527629651446.jpg","title":"Record pensions 17 000 women retiring year","story":"    Women are rapidly closing the gender pension gap with men seeing the difference half over the past decade to just £5,000 as a result of many mothers returning to work after childrenKirsty Anderson, from Prudential, said: ‘As working patterns continue to change and become more flexible, and shared parental leave is more widely encouraged by the government agenda and employers, the future looks positive for narrowing the retirement gender gap.’Trail of destruction!

Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect.

After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.           ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power.

Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life.

We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Rain rage: Man headbutts man with umbrellaCaravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedBlack woman rants at Jewish man as he calls her racist on NY metroOfficer punches bikini-clad girl in the head during arrestChilling moment man is arrested for murdering his partnerEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtScooter rider crashes into parked car at 5mph while \u0027asleep\u0027George Soros: \u0027We may be heading for another financial crisis\u0027    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne.

She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized.

I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms.

the worst fire in Britain for a generationThe report also recognised that, in certain respects, the voluntary sector \u0027came up short, with some systems, structures and approaches not fit for purpose\u0027.Among its recommendations, the report said erse communities need to receive support that is sensitive to their varying needs, and such capabilities need to be embraced as core to emergency response in the UK.It said disaster response systems, behaviours and interventions all need to be tailored to the \u0027varying local socio-economic and cultural dynamics\u0027.The report recommended that, in a major disaster, local secular and faith organisations can draw on their \u0027local rootedness\u0027 to act quickly and sensitively in line with the needs of communities they understand.This capability needs to be better appreciated and supported, including in partnership with local authorities and national actors with expertise in emergency response, the report said.A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Council said: \u0027We are committed to learning the lessons from the Grenfell tragedy and therefore we welcome this report as part of the learning process.\u0027However, it is not right for the council to comment in detail at this stage - this is a matter for the public inquiry which is reviewing the events around the council\u0027s response to the tragedy.\u0027It is our responsibility to ensure that the whole, unvarnished truth is told so that lessons can be learned and to ensure that such a tragedy can never happen again.\u0027We will work with the inquiry to ensure this happens.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBACA8800000578-0-image-m-6_1527607307022.jpg","title":"Energy firm SSE hikes electricity gas prices 6 7","story":"    Energy company SSE is increasing electricity and gas bills by an average of 6.7 per centThis will equate to an average increase of around £1.50 a week for customers buying both gas and electricity. Stephen Forbes, chief commercial officer of SSE Energy Services, said: \u0027We deeply regret having to raise prices and have worked hard to withstand the increasing costs that are largely outside our control by reducing our own internal costs.\u0027However, as we\u0027ve seen with recent adjustments to Ofgem\u0027s price caps, the cost of supplying energy is increasing and this ultimately impacts the prices we\u0027re able to offer customers.\u0027Claire Perry, energy and clean growth minister, said: \u0027It is extremely disappointing that SSE has decided to announce this unjustified price rise -

Rejection: President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the 5-StarLeague\u0027s choice of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister which scuppered the formation of a government this weekInstead, President Mattarella designated former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli to head a politically neutral government, which riled 5 Star and the League - and did nothing to calm financial markets.Mr Cottarelli returned for informal discussions with Mr Mattarella yesterday, after asking for more time to come up with a list of cabinet ministers, and left without comment.Unless there is a surprise imminent breakthrough, Italy will go back to elections, with most major parties calling for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a vote as soon as July 29.       Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the Eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way. Others, such as UBS chief economist Paul Donovan, think it is overblown.\u0027Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Bond market moves do not break up monetary unions.

Now, for the first time, we can reveal the true cost of paying in sterling overseas.Are you bills about to rise? Some energy customers face bill...My partner and I are planning a trip to Japan next spring,...Get more for your holiday money: The best debit and credit...Share this articleIn an experiment run by Starling Bank, identical twins Heidi and Alice, 29, travelled to Berlin for a weekend. They made exactly the same purchases and both used the same debit card, which charges no extra fees for spending abroad.The only difference was that each time they used their cards, Heidi paid in the local currency, euros, whereas Alice paid in pounds.          Alice (pictured above) and Heidi carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds           For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          The research showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

This rose to 78 per cent in \u0027areas that report having experience large-scale migration in recent years\u0027.Nearly half, 47 per cent, felt that protecting British values should take priority over multiculturalism. And 55 per cent said the Government is doing too little to promote traditional British values. This thinking was common among Tory supporters and those who voted to leave the EU, but was also the most popular view among Labour and Remain voters.The Demos report said: \u0027Only three issues appear to truly unite the nation – the belief that the country is in a state of decline and that further change lies on the horizon, feeling that immigration has negatively impacted British society, and believing the nation\u0027s cultures and traditions are not being sufficiently defended and promoted.\u0027 Lord Green of Deddington, head of the Migration Watch UK pressure group, said: \u0027It is absolutely the case that very few people appear to have been sticking up for the culture and traditions of our own country.

Terrified shoppers flee as...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/1EE3252000000578-0-image-m-63_1527609689005.jpg","title":"Royal Sophie launches foul mouthed defence disgraced Kids Company founder","story":"    Actress Sophie Winkleman (pictured with husband Lord Frederick Windsor), Prince Michael of Kent\u0027s daughter-in-law, launched a foul-mouthed defence of the colourful former charity boss Camila BatmanghelidjhLady Frederick Windsor tells me: \u0027They don\u0027t tell the truth.

Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien.

After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.           ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter.   Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Rain rage: Man headbutts man with umbrellaCaravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedBlack woman rants at Jewish man as he calls her racist on NY metroOfficer punches bikini-clad girl in the head during arrestChilling moment man is arrested for murdering his partnerEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtScooter rider crashes into parked car at 5mph while \u0027asleep\u0027George Soros: \u0027We may be heading for another financial crisis\u0027    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show.

Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way.

It’s a phrase from eco-philosopher Timothy Morton, who calls out the human effect on the planet.“It’s to bring attention to the issue from another angle, to look at what humans are doing to provoke climate change,” says Lawrence. “When we think of asteroids, we think of something that will doom the earth, but in this case, it’s actually coming from our own human activity.”Another piece is by the protest art group Dear Climate, who have created 20 banners around the site. They’ve called it General Assembly and have fashioned the flags to match the circle of world flags outside the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.One flag says “Say hello to hurricanes”, while others read “See the sea levels”, “Give me luxury or give me breath” and “Heed your greens”.“They’re meant to be both serious and funny, but to ask people to think about the issue,” says Lawrence. “Most of their works are downloadable from their website, so they can be distributed beyond an art center like us.” The exhibition is not necessarily didactic it’s meant to offer a variety of opinions and outlooks. “We wanted to make this an artist-forward exhibition,” says Lawrence. “Climate change isn’t one thing with one way of looking at the world. We wanted to look at climate change like a syndrome with different factors that taps into something larger, because not every artist is approaching it from the same angle.” Along the stunning landscape of Storm King – about 60 miles north of New York City – one thing stands out: the palm trees, of all things. They were planted there by artist Mary Mattingly for her artwork Along the Lines of Displacement: A Tropical Food Forest. There is a set of three tropical fruit trees, including coconut palms and a ponytail palm, which were shipped from Florida. Since an expected temperature rise of 4C is expected across the globe in the years to come, could residents ever harvest a palm tree in upstate New York?“This piece asks us: ‘What are the opportunities that climate change could bring our way? And how can we be ready?’” asks Lawrence. “Are there ways we might be able to harvest certain crops in the future? And in a place like Alaska, if we are dealing with climate change, what kind of opportunities will there be to harvest if the ice is melted?”One artwork is more like a treasure hunt. Permanent Field Observations, by David Brooks, puts art enthusiasts on a mission to find his 30 bronze sculptures, each of which look stunningly real, amid Storm King’s forested area.“David spent time finding moments in the woods that aren’t permanent, moments he wanted to cast into bronze a stick with a bunch of mushrooms on it, leaves, a stone, branches,” says Lawrence. “The bronze piece will outlast the original works of nature, so the artist asks people to imagine they’re on a scientific expedition and to think like a scientist.”The exhibition is not to only ponder climate change, but also to consider our actions. “It’s to find new ways to think about our environment and climate change and our own place in all of that,” says Lawrence. “Art asks us to change the way we look at the world, where we are in life and what our responsibilities are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f623ca269ef176dfaa8c30cff1cf576b36673a4/0_0_3579_2147/master/3579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f722602bfff05ec9a0e7d210cdb343","title":"frank horvat in pictures","story":"Italian-born photographer Frank Horvat, a contemporary of Henri Cartier-Bresson, revolutionised fashion shoots with his black-and-white realism and eye for a killer pose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e73ee347211e397e3d0bfe5de7a5da4af5faa6c/4_481_3698_2218/master/3698.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=018ee94f18adb2fcabf178977487c028","title":"meet jacob burckhardt the thinker who invented culture","story":"The visionary Swiss historian helps us understand our world just as much as his contemporary Karl MarxThe bicentenary of the birth of a Swiss historian might not seem the most glamorous of anniversaries. Unlike his contemporary Karl Marx, also born in 1818, Jacob Burckhardt never inspired any revolutions and doesn’t get his face on T-shirts. Yet some of us are celebrating the 200th birthday of Jacob Burckhardt lavishly. This week a British Academy conference reinterprets his intellectual legacy with contributions from leading international scholars and me, kicking off with a public event tonight at the Warburg Institute.What’s all the fuss about? Take a look at the names of the ’s online sections: opinion, sport, culture ... why culture? Once upon a time, newspapers used to have arts sections. Today, they’ve caught up – very belatedly – with Burckhardt. The use of the term culture to mean a broad and changing flow of forms from opera to video games may seem like an innovation of the postmodern age, but it actually goes back to Burckhardt’s 1860 book The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy.Burckhardt invented culture as we know it – not just the official “arts”, but any human activity that has symbolic meaning.Newspapers and their websites are still behind Burckhardt on this. Looking for articles about fashion and food? You’ll find them in “lifestyle”. Burckhardt saw these too as culture. Of course, so do we – it would just get hard to organise stuff if it was all classed in one big mix. But everyone knows today that clothes are significant cultural creations and that cooking is about meaning as much as flavour. The amazing thing is how clearly Burckhardt saw it 1860.The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy has not one single chapter dedicated to Renaissance art. It does have, however, a section called Ridicule and Wit. Burckhardt explores every nuance of how people expressed themselves in 15th-century Italy, from cruel jokes to street festivals. In one of his most astonishing insights he even explores how people listened – he shows how sitting through long speeches was a cultural rite in itself. It’s a revelation that makes you think about music and performance in a totally new way. One day, someone will write the history of how we listen today, the cultural history of headphones and podcasts. And that historian will owe everything to Burckhardt. So who was this daring thinker? His portrait on Switzerland’s 1,000-franc note makes him look stern yet sensitive. Born in Basel to a wealthy family and educated in Berlin, where he was taught by the pioneering historian Leopold von Ranke, he doesn’t come across as much of a rebel. Yet Burckhardt’s work is an insidious attack on Germanic nationalism. Writing at a time when Prussia was leading the unification of Germany and pride in Teutonic northern virtues was growing, Burckhardt went out of his way to belittle north European achievements and show that Italy was the true source of European genius.There is a sensual, amoral intensity to his vision of the Renaissance. He thrills to the ruthless violence of Cesare Borgia, and of Ferrante, ruler of Naples, who according to Burckhardt used to make his guests dine alongside the preserved corpses of his torture victims. It’s the kind of gory detail that makes his masterpiece a still-powerful read. It also widens his notion of culture still further. For Burckhardt, politics and war are cultural forms. He gets this idea from the Renaissance itself – one of his inspirations, Machiavelli, wrote a book called The Art of War.So perhaps, in his bicentenary, Burckhardt has another, more troubling relevance. Writing when modern European states were being forged, he called his opening chapter The State As a Work of Art. After 1918, it would be dictators who forged a demonic art of mass politics. The Marxist Walter Benjamin accused fascism of “aestheticising” politics. Anyone who has seen Leni Riefenstahl’s film Triumph of the Will knows what he meant.In 2018 we seem to be living in Burkhardt’s world – and it ain’t pretty. Not only is everything culture, but politics is a mad art form, ruled by symbolic forces and gestures that surge through social media. Are the new populist monsters of politics the descendants of the Renaissance despots who shocked and fascinated Burckhardt?This quiet scholar’s great book helps us understand our world just as much as the writings of Marx. More so, I fear, in this age when culture Trumps reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee391b0df7b30b1813b678cf39d8f8628ae5f80/0_719_2395_1436/master/2395.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b604fefbdc513dab2653f95481d9da16","title":"ursula k le guin documentary reveals author","story":"New documentary shows author confiding that she once struggled to picture ‘a woman wizard’ and that ‘the Earthsea books as feminist literature are a total complete bust’A new documentary about Ursula K Le Guin shows the late author reflecting on the impact of feminism on her work, revealing that she had been “a woman pretending to think like a man” and that her much-loved Earthsea books “are a total complete bust” as feminist literature.Le Guin’s first three books about Earthsea centre on the male wizard Ged, with women “either marginal or essentially dependent on men”, according to the author herself. In director Arwen Curry’s forthcoming Worlds of Ursula K Le Guin, which Curry worked on with Le Guin for 10 years, the novelist speaks of how when she started writing, “men were at the centre” of fantasy and admits that “from my own cultural upbringing, I couldn’t go down deep and come up with a woman wizard”.The third book in the series, The Farthest Shore, was published in 1972. When Le Guin came to write the fourth, which centres on the female character, Tenar, she found it “just wouldn’t go”. It took her another 17 years to work out how to tell Tenar’s story, with the 1990 novel Tehanu.“What I’d been doing as a writer was being a woman pretending to think like a man … I had to rethink my entire approach to writing fiction … it was important to think about privilege and power and domination, in terms of gender, which was something science fiction and fantasy had not done,” Le Guin tells Curry. “All I changed is the point of view. All of a sudden we are seeing Earthsea … from the point of view of the powerless.”Although Le Guin won many awards during her lifetime, the documentary – which will premiere on 10 June at the Sheffield DocFest – reveals her initial struggle to be published. Rejection letters from publishers in the 50s tell her, variously: “You write well and are obviously very erudite. But here you have a book that we feel, regretfully, would be of interest to very few American readers,” and “the basic subject matter and background is so remote that I could not encourage you to recast it from a practical point of view”, and “there would not be a large enough audience for a novel of this kind”. Le Guin tells Curry: “When I started writing, the basic assumption about fiction was that men were at the centre of it … I don’t know how many times I was told I write well, but, ‘we don’t know quite what you’re doing’. I was beginning to feel a little desperate. If I can’t publish anything except for the occasional poem in a tiny, tiny poetry magazine what am I doing? Am I kidding myself?”The documentary also features conversations with authors Michael Chabon, David Mitchell and Neil Gaiman, who credits Le Guin’s 1968 novel The Wizard of Earthsea, about a wizard at a magical school, with inspiring Harry Potter.“I don’t think Harry Potter could have existed without Earthsea. That was the original, the finest and the best,” Gaiman says in the documentary, adding: “What Ursula was having to navigate was the societal prejudices against science fiction, against the fantastic, and against children’s fiction. All of these things were marginalised.”The documentary makers, who funded the film with a combination of a grant and crowdfunding from more than 3,000 backers, describe Le Guin as an author who “defiantly held her ground on the margin of American letters until the sheer excellence of her work, at long last, forced the mainstream to embrace fantastic literature”. Le Guin died in January 2018, at the age of 88."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bb3ab15e8f2061d51dd239a2175db612d479126/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e02a8cd6369de8274c350bae55216bc","title":"bristols green trailblazers 10 businesses transforming the city","story":"From urban farms that encourage sustainable food production to a zero-plastic-waste shop, a host of enterprises are helping Bristol live up to its reputation as one of Europe’s green capitalsIn 2015, Bristol was the first UK city to win the European Green Capital award. The city showed that it had a well-established record of achieving high environmental standards and had ambitious goals for improving the environment and sustainable development.With such an environmentally sound reputation, there are many jewels in Bristol’s green business crown. Here are 10 companies helping to grow the city’s green economy …RefillRefill launched in Bristol in September 2015 and is now a nationwide scheme. It was started by the people behind the equally environmentally conscious City to Sea, that campaigns to help tackle the problem of plastics in our oceans. Refill aims to bring together businesses, cafes, museums and other public spaces to make water available for the public to refill their own water bottles, reducing the demand for single-use plastics. There is also a Refill app where you can find free water sources nearby and also add your own refill stations.SkipchenSkipchen’s aim is to tackle food waste. In 2014 it ran an extremely successful pop-up cafe in Bristol that repurposed food that discarded by supermarkets and other restaurants that was still perfectly good for eating. It now operates within the community by having conversations about the problems of waste and working with businesses in collecting their surplus. More recently, Skipchen travelled to areas including Lesbos in Greece, working to help feed refugees out of its Food Rescue Ambulance.Bee the ChangeAs part of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Bee the Change set up community bee hives around the city that are nurtured and cared for by the community. It also gave educational talks in schools, universities and other organisations to discuss the role of bees in the environment, as well as allowing attendees to extract their own honey. Bee the Change also plants bee forage (their food supply – nectar and pollen from blossoming plants) and builds sanctuaries for local bees. If you’re keen on getting your own beekeeping wings, natural beekeeping courses are available for groups or iniduals.Incredible Edible BristolIncredible Edible launched in Todmorden, Yorkshire, and has since spread as far as Canada, New Zealand … and Bristol too. It works hard to encourage locals to take advantage of whatever land they have, and nurture it to grow their own food. Thanks to the Bristol team, there are now 30 edible gardens scattered across the city – in parks, on street corners and even in station car parks – that are cared for by volunteers. It’s available for anyone to take away and use to make delicious meals – think herbs and easily grown veg.Grow BristolWhen you think of farming you probably think of huge expanses of fields, tractors and endless countryside. Well, Grow Bristol is here to make you think differently, through urban farming. The urban farming enterprise is developing innovative and sustainable ways to grow food in the city to benefit the people who live there, and has won awards for its work. It supplies greens and other produce to organisations including Farmdrop, who deliver local produce, and Source food hall and cafe, as well as local restaurants.The Severn ProjectAlthough it has a similar model of sustainable food growing as Grow Bristol and Incredible Edible, the Severn Project also helps support people who are recovering from addiction and other mental health issues, and assists ex-offenders by helping them return to employment. Currently, the Severn Project grows produce such as spinach and micro herbs in 1.5 acres of polytunnels, where it also harvests rainwater.Zero GreenIf you’re trying to avoid buying products with excess plastic packaging, it can be tricky finding suitable produce in your local supermarket. Zero Green is Bristol’s first waste-free food shop: customers bring their own containers and bags to fill up with everyday items such as rice and pasta, washing powder and shampoo. The shop is even fitted out with reclaimed wood from the Bristol Wood Recycling Project, which goes to show how well the eco-community in Bristol works together.Bristol Wood Recycling ProjectThe Bristol Wood Recycling Project wants to make sure no wood goes to waste. It reclaims unused wood and provides affordable wood to the community through a small range of furniture and budget firewood and kindling. The project also fosters a community of volunteers who work at the yard.Real Wrap Co.Real Wrap Co. is an environmentally friendly sandwich company that supplies local universities and other big contracts. It produces about 100,000 products a week, but sends almost zero food waste to landfill. It was featured on Channel 4’s Food Unwrapped for being one of the first sandwich companies in the UK to supply leftover bread for the making of beer, to help cut waste.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"italy brussels descent abyss eu economics","story":"As much as some want to believe it, the EU has little to do with the country’s failure to put its house in orderAs Italians wrestle with their constitution and possibly head towards another general election, are they victims of a financial swindle perpetrated by the Germans? To read some of the commentary, and hear voices from the streets of Rome and Naples, you would think that they were.The people of Athens accused the Germans and, to a lesser extent, the French, who between them are the main props of the single currency, of being the architects of their impoverishment. It seems many Italians have followed suit.But can a country be a victim of a financial fraud in the way that, say, an inidual is the victim of clever marketing by a bank selling insurance that will never pay out?The mismatch in information and expertise between an inidual and their bank is colossal. It’s why we have regulators, and why regulators are supposed to keep tabs on the banks’ latest money-making wheezes.A quick look at the financial crisis and its impact on the euro area shows that there were several countries found with their pants down when Lehman Brothers went bust. Ireland, Spain and Portugal were especially hard hit.Yet none of these countries blamed the euro for their ills. The Irish realised that they had binged on euros – borrowed at rates previously only available to bigger AAA-rated countries – to generate a property boom of extraordinary proportions, pay public sector workers as if they were commercial marketing executives and generally live high on the hog.When the government of the day pushed through some of the most eye-watering austerity measures anywhere in Europe, the lack of equality in its impact was decided in Dublin, not Brussels.The Spanish also spent oodles of cheap euros on a property boom and a ludicrous obsession with infrastructure that meant it either built or planned 30-plus international airports, most of which were scrapped or mothballed.How could Madrid blame others for this frenzied attempt to escape its relatively recent agrarian past and enter the 21st century in supersonic style? These were homegrown decisions. Likewise Portugal, which elected a left-of-centre government that got on with the job of enacting sensible economic policies to escape austerity, improve employment prospects and stay within its meagre budget. Italians, on the other hand, cannot get their own house in order. Instead they search around for someone else to blame. A classic example can be seen in Venice, where beautiful ochre and rust red plaster falls off its stunning palazzos at regular intervals into the canals, never to be replaced. Renovation must be done according to ancient practices, and at huge cost. This rule is imposed by a regional authority that will brook no compromise, not even those put forward by city council. Subsidies that were once offered have been scrapped, leaving the buildings exposed to the elements.Then there is the mafia, mass early retirement, huge levels of tax evasion and avoidance, and a low birthrate. These are all problems created in Italy, not Brussels.That doesn’t mean the reaction of Brussels technocrats is in any way uplifting. They do themselves no favours when they deny any relationship with Rome or any part in its crisis. The euro has suited the Germans, who get a cheap currency relative to the country’s strength, and harmed Italian exporters, who have to battle against the headwind of an expensive currency.And if the European Union is to survive, it must show a recognition that lenders are complicit in any bankruptcy, just as the creditor is. If a bank or government lends money to Italy, it does it knowing the country is on an arc of decline that could accelerate at any moment, given the volatile nature of international financial markets. That means that when problems hit, debt forgiveness must be part of the deal, just as it should have been when Greece found itself unable to borrow.But the disturbingly hard line taken by some Brussels officials against Italy should not detract from the fact that Italy is the architect of its Byzantine public sector structures, bizarre tax rules and sclerotic employment regulations. Not those who designed the euro or the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b882df44492144f083ce0a108b7780af4656adf/0_184_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6caf0a9818a36f4c0cd9bec126af2dc4","title":"pret people power sandwich payout employees","story":"Today could be a good day to go into a Pret a Manger and asking for a coffee in your nicest voice, with an extra big smile. That longed for free cappuccino could be yours. Yesterday’s announcement of JAB Holding’s £1.5bn takeover of the Pret chain was given an extra shot with the news that 12,000 employees worldwide would be getting a £1,000 payment once the deal goes through. It was the icing on the carrot cake.The usually reliable bonhomie of Pret staff does not happen by chance. They do things a bit differently there. People are hired because of their attitude and personality, not on account of their experience in the retail sector. Teams see how potential new recruits shape up, and have some say on whether the new person gets the job permanently.At a time when many are rightly concerned about ever-decreasing job quality and the precariousness of employment, this reminder that there are other ways of managing people is refreshing.But in case you thought I’d drunk the organic Kool Aid, it’s worth pointing out that Pret is not a wildly generous or flawless operation. The company is not an accredited living wage employer. Last month, the Advertising Standards Authority told Pret to stop using the word “natural” to describe all its products, since its bread has as many E numbers in it as a supermarket slice. Last year the company executed a rapid U-turn after initially trying to get teenagers to do unpaid shifts (but with free food!) as part of a work experience scheme. Pret is not a charity. If it were, its new German owners would not have coughed up £1.5bn for it.The impressive ersity of Pret’s staff, reflected in the variety of names and national flags to be found on employees’ badges, may have something to do with the positive vibe the best-run stores display. Spontaneity and informality rule the day. Will Pret ever find it necessary to close down all their branches for an afternoon to run racism awareness training, as Starbucks did this week? It seems unlikely.In fact, as we are encouraged to cower and panic ahead of the inevitable and irresistible march of the robots into almost every workplace in the land, Pret employees remind us that human beings still have quite a lot to offer. They can make nice food and sell it to us efficiently and politely. It is a winning formula.Pret spotted a gap in the lunchtime market and made it its own. It’s not the cheapest deal on the block. Not everyone can afford to go there very often. And while the offer of £1,000 to every employee may sound impressive, it will actually represent only a small added cost of doing the takeover deal. It’s really the equivalent of one of those free cups of coffee some of us have been lucky enough to pick up at Pret over the years.The important lesson from Pret’s success is that a good product that offers decent value for money will sell. And that treating people well at work will more than pay for itself over time. As the management consultant John DiJulius says in his book The Customer Service Revolution: “The best marketing is happy, engaged employees.” We can assume that, as of this morning, Pret’s employees are going to be bit happier and more fully engaged than they were a day or two ago.• Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdaf17e8e14ea15cb4831c17854ac93df7fb79b2/0_145_3376_2025/master/3376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24b17d8d3cd69ea33d2fcde7716916ad","title":"raheem sterling media young black men footballer tattoo","story":"Whether it’s his choice of tattoo or the variation in his spending, the message to the England footballer is clear: know your placeIn a little over two weeks, the World Cup finals begin in Russia. You would expect the nation to be concentrating its efforts on over-hyping England’s chances and lauding our potential star players. Instead, some parts seem hell-bent on finding reasons to criticise one of the country’s top prospects, Raheem Sterling.After scoring 18 goals from midfield for the runaway winners of this year’s Premier League, you’d expect Sterling to be one of England’s darlings. At the tender age of 23, he has already represented his country at two tournaments, and played key roles for two of England’s biggest teams, Liverpool and Manchester City. As a player with speed, genuine flair and an eye for goal, Sterling is a rarity in the England setup.But this week, there were calls for him to be dropped from the squad after a gun tattoo was spotted on his right leg. Even after Sterling, whose father was killed in a shooting in Jamaica when he was just two, explained that he was vehemently against guns and that the unfinished tattoo symbolised the ability of his right foot as well as being a tribute to his father, some commentators – including Piers Morgan – were still not ready to back down.Morgan told his 6.5 million Twitter followers that Sterling’s tattoo, which looks like an AR15 assault rifle, was inappropriate because it was the same gun sometimes used in school shootings in the USA. After Sterling posted his response, Morgan said: “Perhaps he should explain it better then. Because I fail to see why tattooing an assault rifle on your leg does anything to combat gun violence.”Even when it was pointed out that Morgan’s beloved Arsenal is nicknamed “the Gunners”, has a cannon on its club crest and was founded by munition workers, he was still trying to dictate what kind of tattoos the young footballer should wear on his skin. “Here’s an idea: Stick a big X across that assault rifle tattoo \u0026amp the words ‘NO TO GUNS’. Then it works how I presume you intended it to work. At the moment, it looks like you’re glamourising gun use.”Readers of the Sun, which often leads the charge against Sterling, are predominantly working class, so the stories read more like cautionary warnings on the sorts of behaviour that should be frowned upon. The paper encourages its readers to resent Sterling’s wealth while rarely challenging the money and behaviour of the established middle classes.After the latest story broke and Sterling received overwhelming support, the Sun, which has form for annoying football fans, attempted to immunise itself from allegations of racism by doubling down. Richard Taylor, whose son Damilola died back in 2000 after being attacked on the streets in Peckham, south London, was quoted: “Footballers need to be aware kids look up to them. He must apologise to the families of gun victims.”But even the Sun’s choice in approaching Taylor for comment shows their muddled thinking on black communities. Damilola’s tragic death happened after he was attacked and fell on to some broken glass. It had nothing to do with gun violence. I can imagine someone at the Sun lamenting they had no more current contacts with families of those who have died from actual gun violence in the UK, and then shrugging and saying to themselves, “Well, close enough”.For Sterling, this latest “controversy” must have been met with an air of resignation. The young player is rarely out of the newspapers for some perceived misdemeanour or other. As a lifelong Liverpool fan, I may have been disappointed by the way he left the club, but the treatment he gets from the press seems relentless and unjustified. He was called greedy for asking to be paid relative to his skills while at Liverpool. He was called obscene for spending too much money when he did up his mum’s house, buying her a fancy sink. Then he is criticised for being too frugal when he shops at Primark, Poundland, Greggs or when he flies on a budget airline. He has been criticised for smoking a shisha pipe and inhaling nitrous oxide from balloons, when both activities are legal. He has even been criticised for not keeping his expensive car clean enough.When these criticisms are viewed together, the pattern seems clear: Raheem has money now and some parts of the media don’t like how he spends it. They will talk about “his character” but really they just seem to think he’s a bit too flash and isn’t humble enough (although the stories about him liking pasties and pound shops would seem to indicate otherwise). Almost every story about him references his birth in Jamaica, his humble upbringing in northwest London and his relatively new wealth. They are thinly veiled attacks on all confident, working-class and yes, black young men who appear not to know their place.When Stormzy has the cheek to comment on Grenfell or when Mario Ballotelli gives money to a homeless person they are not pleasing some middle-class commentators. The subtext seems to be, “your talents may have earned you some cash, but don’t get uppity – know your place”.When Morgan was warned that his attacks on Sterling might impact on the star’s World Cup performance, he replied: “Oh Pur-lease. We fail at World Cups because we don’t play well enough. If you can’t stand a bit of media scrutiny, go and be a dustman.” The routes out of poverty are very scarce for the young, working-class black man. Sport, music and entertainment do provide a path for the select few. The narrative reserved for those who make it, though, often sounds a lot like, “We have let you in, now don’t do anything that makes us regret it”.• Maurice Mcleod is a social commentator and director of Media Diversified"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780a9dc5bb3b4289bbc619faaee26fd5c608318f/0_458_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06192c09c76eeb91b3358bfba570df46","title":"vivid 2018 shows sydney in new light in pictures","story":"Vivid Sydney is an annual festival that places light sculptures and installations throughout the city.

But the grandeur of rewilding can also make the concept seem remote or irrelevant to people living ever more urban lives.To declare we are rewilding our garden, or window box, is probably a contradiction in terms and risks cheapening this important conservation concept. But there are principles of rewilding – stepping back and allowing natural processes to occur, and encouraging wild plants and insects – which we can all embrace. The most relevant rewilding idea for us urban beings? Let go, and reduce our micromanagement of whatever small patch of earth we own, rent or enjoy and influence.The first step is to change our way of seeing. I’ve struggled with “weedy” patios and “rank” lawns for a few years but I now see “tidy” gardens as they are for every other living species: desolate and hostile, stripped of the natural abundance and vigour that our soils and climate naturally serve up, even in the heart of a city.We’re persuaded to apply far too many chemicals to our gardens and these are killing the insects upon which human life ultimately depends.For those of us lucky enough to have a garden, we may well have a front garden which is now concrete, shingle or tarmac. The number of front gardens totally paved over has tripled from 1.5m to 4.59m between 2005 and 2015, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. A London survey found that the capital is losing the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hyde Parks of greenery a year from its domestic gardens – about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres).Even if your front garden still needs to house a car, there is space for unruly nature. Plant a native hedge (young hazel, field maple, hawthorn and other “whips” can cost as little as 30p each from good nurseries) or squeeze insect-friendly flowers such as Verbena borariensis, buddleia or English lavender onto your gravel. Think vertical in small concrete spaces: our native ivy (Hedera helix) is a superb wildlife host – a source of food for birds and insects, shelter for nests and a food plant for holly blue butterfly caterpillars.Just as water sustains life on earth, the single best thing for bioersity in a small space is to add water. And you don’t need much space for a pond. A washing-up bowl will do. I created a 50cm x 90cm pond, and collected some duckweed and other common pond “weeds” from a friend’s pond. Within a year, it was found by mating frogs, newts, pond snails and damselflies.The trend for wildflower meadows leads to substituting lawns for sowing a meadow of flowering annuals which looks great for a summer and then dies away. It’s often better to simply stop mowing. If lawns are old and not weedkillered to death, they are full of different species of grass and herbs, many of which “flower” as beautifully as flowers. I still have neatly mown paths and borders around my long grass. Orchid-lovers like to cut their “meadows” in July but I leave mine until November – late seeds are food for goldfinches and a high autumnal cut doesn’t kill the butterflies such as meadow browns whose caterpillars have fed up on grass and are safely hibernating in the turf.In an era of garden makeovers, we seek instant transformations. When we want a “wild” garden we buy wild flower seeds or wild plug plants or expensive “native” perennials. But how about standing back for a year? Wild nature needs space and time but responds far faster than we expect. Do nothing but watch your garden and you’ll be amazed by what pops up. A friend living on a modern housing estate in Leicester had orchids appear in his lawn as soon as he let it get a bit overgrown. My newly unkempt lawn suddenly sprouted oak trees (acorns buried by jays), hawthorn, holly, hazel and a profusion of oxeye daisies, clover and even cuckooflower. The things that find their way into your plot naturally are likely to be well-suited to your soil, and more likely to thrive than introduced species. The more vigorous arrivals – such as bindweed, bramble and nettle – may have to be managed so they don’t swamp everything else, which is contrary to rewilding ideals. But then some bramble and nettle is superbly useful for hundreds of birds and insects. Even thistles are food for a variety of moth caterpillars and the caterpillars of the painted lady butterfly.Cut hedges less. Let dandelions flower and seed. Allow a few poppies to flower between vegetables. It’s hard for keen gardeners to relax. We also learn “native good, non-native bad”. While we should use native wild flower mixes (rather than cheaper generic mixes which contain non-native species), we cannot turn back the clock and cities are full of non-native plants. Laurel hedging is terrible for nature, as is leylandii, but there are plenty of insect-friendly non-native flowers and shrubs, from buddleia to cotoneaster.Yellow rattle is a pretty little yellow flower which is parasitic on grass. It’s difficult to establish because seeds need to be really fresh but I obtained some from my father and scattered them on my lawn. (If you don’t have a yellow rattle-growing parent, try a reputable wild flower nursery.) Each July, I scatter the fresh seeds and the yellow rattle is booming. Grass is great but often too vigorous for other wild flowers to thrive. Yellow rattle creates the space for less robust flowering plants to thrive. It’s the cornerstone of a vibrant perennial wildflower meadow.We may only have a window box but there is always space for nature. We can cram dozens of wildflowers onto a window sill. Do we have a wall on which we can erect a birdbox? A roof for a swift box? (South-facing is usually too hot for breeding birds.) Or any outside wall-space for bug hotels?In the course of writing this, my six-year-old daughter barged into my study. It was important: she was carrying a stunning eyed hawkmoth. She’d found it in a patch of sallow – a scrubby “weed” of a bush. I planted a thicket of sallows (29p each) three years ago. They are the foodplant for dozens of insects, including moths and butterflies, and the eyed hawkmoth was almost certainly laying eggs on them. If you embrace a teeny bit of wild, wild nature will embrace you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8240c9dfccaddc42f6f596816014c4e8b9f22d59/0_14_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f31537ef38873a50ba17ff266ef001f9","title":"best alternative films summer guardian","story":"While the multiplex might be overrun with superheroes, dinosaurs and space cowboys, the season also offers up a set of films untouched by sequelitisOn paper, Hearts Beat Loud might tick off a few too many twee Sundance-friendly boxes, but there’s something disarmingly likable about what actually lies underneath. Parks and Recreation’s Nick Offerman stars as the owner of a failing record store in Brooklyn whose resistance to change is driving his business into the ground. His daughter, played by Dope’s Kiersey Clemons, is one summer away from med school and the impending move is already starting to sting. As a way of bringing them together before they’re torn apart, he reinstates an old tradition: a jam session with the pair using their musical talents to create new music. It’s a warm-hearted little film that mostly avoids preciousness thanks to a strong central pairing, a niftily assembled supporting cast (Toni Collette, Ted Danson, Blythe Danner, American Honey’s Sasha Lane) and some great music.Oscar buzz doesn’t typically swirl around horror films but then not many of them star Toni Collette, who scored a nomination for her role as a struggling mother in 1999’s The Sixth Sense. She’s gaining buzz for another matriarchal role, this time in even darker territory as a woman dealing with the death of her mother and the effect it has on her fractured family. It’s a film that’s already invited comparison to The Exorcist with horrified Sundance audiences calling it one of the scariest for some time. It’s a difficult, tonally severe, often audaciously shocking film about the unbearable weight of grief and the inescapability of familial sin that will ide audiences upon release.With his ominous, stylish breakout It Follows, director David Robert Mitchell announced himself as a rare horror talent, squeezing scares from every scene of his high-concept nightmare. Rather than continue to show off his genre prowess, his follow-up takes him into an entirely different part of town, specifically Los Angeles, for a neo-noir comedy thriller. It stars Andrew Garfield as a drifter searching for a mysterious young woman, played by Riley Keough, and stumbling on a much larger conspiracy. The film has confounded, frustrated and intrigued critics at its Cannes premiere: some hated it (the ’s Peter Bradshaw gave it one star and called it “catastrophically boring”) and some loved it (Time Out’s Joshua Rothkopf gave it five stars and called it “hypnotic”). Since director Debra Granik broke out with 2010’s soulful drama Winter’s Bone, her output has been minimal (just 2014’s little-seen documentary Stray Dog) so expectations were high for her narrative return at this year’s Sundance. The result is another stark study of working-class America, this time centering on a father and daughter, played by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, who are surviving in the wilderness. But when authorities get involved, their fragile existence is in jeopardy. It’s a delicate, naturalistic film that might not be as accessible as Winter’s Bone but again proves that Granik is a measured and empathetic humanist.Falling into the increasingly populated subgenre of documentaries where truth is far stranger than fiction (see also: Tickled, The Imposter, Catfish), this plainly told yet fascinatingly plotted film tells the story of an unlikely reunion. A set of identical triplets were separated at birth and adopted by three different families. Years later, through a set of unusual circumstances, they meet and once the excitement and confusion settles, they search for the real reason for their separation. There are some staggering twists along the way and while an argument could be made for its suitability for a smaller screen, it’s involving enough to cause plentiful discussion upon release.Giving the infinitely talented Lakeith Stanfield another starring vehicle (his second lead, after searing work in Crown Heights) and providing stoners with a new favorite movie, rapper Boots Riley’s directorial debut is worthy of all kinds of attention. It’s a feverish, funny, scary, angry, surreal satire about a black man finding out that his “white voice” can unlock a whole new world of opportunity. Despite a plot overflowing with disparate elements (the film lurches between slapstick and body horror), it remains confidently balanced announcing Riley as a fiercely original film-maker and cementing Stanfield as a bona fide star.While it might seem too soon for another Whitney Houston documentary after Nick Broomfield’s compelling if slightly lacking 2017 attempt, Touching the Void director Kevin Macdonald has secured an authorized take on the star’s rise and fall. He’s gained access to her family and friends, giving the film a more comprehensive feel, and uncovered some further tragic details from her life. It premiered at Cannes to mostly positive reviews, and while some are still seeking a doc that focuses more on Houston’s musical prowess rather than her troubling backstory, Whitney is set to be one of the summer’s most talked-about films.Arriving soon after Lady Bird, this middle school-set drama promises to deliver an equally awkward and idiosyncratic look at a period in life usually served with a heavy coating of gloss. It was one of the best-reviewed titles at this year’s Sundance festival, marking the directorial debut of comedian Bo Burnham and following the misadventures of a girl preparing herself for the transition to high school. A superlative-packed trailer might play up the film’s lighter moments but reviews suggest it’s not just a cringe-filled comedy. Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson called is “simultaneously harrowing and sweet” while the AV Club’s AA Dowd praised its combination of “crushing realism and humane affection”.US release: 13 July (UK release: TBC but screening at Sundance London on 2 June)One of 2014’s most underrated films, Appropriate Behavior served as an almighty showcase for writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan. It was a marvel of wit, sadness and insight, telling the story of a woman dealing with a difficult break-up. Her follow-up is an adaptation of Emily M Danforth’s 2012 novel about a young girl shipped off to a conversion center to “cure” her homosexuality. It was warmly received at Sundance, picking up the festival’s highest honor, the grand jury prize, and gifts Chloë Grace Moretz with arguably her first fully-formed adult performance.Despite a rather muted premiere at last year’s Toronto film festival, there’s been steady background noise accompanying literary drama The Wife. The cause of such buzz is a question that we won’t see answered until next year: can this film finally win Glenn Close her Oscar? The six-time nominee remains one of the Academy’s most cruelly overlooked talents and with many calling this one of her best performances, her luck could finally be changing. In the film she plays the wife of a celebrated author, played by an equally impressive Jonathan Pryce, who has spent the majority of her life living in his shadow but as cracks start to appear in their marriage, her position experiences a dramatic shift. It’s a dazzling showcase for Close and a compelling drama in its own right.It’s been a rocky few years for Spike Lee, with a number of his projects failing to land, from his doomed Oldboy remake to his uneven yet often startlingly effective Chi-raq to the dismally received vampire flick Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. But after he transformed his 1986 calling card She’s Gotta Have It into a well-received Netflix series last year, he’s returning to the big screen with a renewed sense of vigour at a time when America needs him most. In fact-based 70s drama BlacKkKlansman, John David Washington stars as a black detective going undercover, with the help of a white cop, played by Adam Driver, to infiltrate the local chapter of the Klan. It picked up the grand prix award at Cannes after a 10-minute standing ovation, with reviews suggesting it might be Lee’s biggest hit for years.Hoping to repeat the summer sleepover success of 2017’s The Big Sick, this romantic comedy, also produced by Judd Apatow, has a nifty conceit. Based on the Nick Hornby novel, it tells of a love triangle between Annie (Rose Byrne), her boyfriend Duncan (Chris O’Dowd) and Tucker (Ethan Hawke), the guy who happens to be both Annie’s new lover and Duncan’s favorite musician. Can the unofficial Bridesmaids reunion of Apatow, Byrne and O’Dowd lead to similarly crowd-pleasing mirth?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff68bc5cef4df3598b9910c4c1bc9139d4fa7d6/0_419_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed0b914142bda24a5db5fa371f0e67c","title":"a beginners guide to the world cup 2018 when does the world cup start","story":"From when does the World Cup start to who’s likely to win football’s greatest prize – the 2018 tournament explainedThe Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years. This year’s competition kicks off on 14 June, when hosts Russia play Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. After a total of 64 matches played in 12 venues across 11 different Russian cities, the champions will be crowned in the same arena on 14 July. It is, without question, the biggest, most prestigious sporting event on the planet.OK, so who organises it and for how long has it been “a thing”?Fifa stands for the Féderation Internationale de Football Association and their third president Jules Rimet was the innovator behind the first World Cup, an invitational tournament contested by just 13 teams that was staged and won by Uruguay in 1930. This year’s tournament will be the 21st.With just 32 teams taking part, an awful lot of nations must miss out. That hardly seems fair.With the exception of Russia, who qualify automatically as hosts, the other 31 teams all had to go through a rigorous two-year qualifying process to make it this far. Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it. While Fifa are confident it will be a success, many doom-mongers are predicting that VAR could become the main, unwelcome talking point of Russia 2018.If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning Uruguay as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Argentina in their qualifying group.”If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I not say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning England as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Scotland in their qualifying group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321fb67c44181d39a421f4877a5b39915b754da1/755_28_2079_1247/master/2079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e5ae91e60237845024e77da47f4dad","title":"cafu picks his all time brazil xi","story":"The brilliant full-back picks his all-time side from an impossibly talented group of players who have represented Brazil down the years. Now you can do the same with our interactive toolWow, choosing the Brazil best XI of all time – that’s a tough one. There are so many brilliant players in each position, and that means some great players will miss out. My team is set up in a super offensive formation. We might concede a lot of goals, but we would score so many more. In fact, I can guarantee five goals every game!The best form of defence is to have the ball. A team with Falcão, Zico and Rivellino at its heart could play for years without making a mistake in possession. When you have the ball, you don’t have a problem. That is my philosophy in choosing my all-time Brazil XI.The goalkeeper in my special team is Cláudio Taffarel. He was so calm, smooth and peaceful, always giving us confidence on the field. He didn’t do anything fancy, never jumped or ed unnecessarily and always had the ball under control. He played three World Cups, always as Brazil’s No 1. That is not an easy achievement.My right-back is Carlos Alberto Torres. Whether defending or attacking, he was always good. Carlos was a great leader, but his technique was even more incredible. His famous goal against Italy in 1970 was such a beautiful, powerful strike.The two central defenders are Aldair and Lúcio. They never played together, but I believe that they would form an amazing partnership. Aldair was very calm, never made a bad tackle and his positioning was incredible. He was my team-mate at Roma and with the Seleção – he saved my life many times when I was attacking. Lúcio was more aggressive and intense. He scored many goals, and had a great passing range and all-round quality.Left-back, for sure, is Roberto Carlos. A world champion, he played at a high level for many years, with the same quality and intensity whether defending or attacking. He was a giant. I have never seen a shot as powerful as his. He had a missile in his leg!Midfield is the hardest area of the team to pick. There are many, many players who could play in the middle of a Brazil dream team, but I can only pick four. First, my defensive midfielder is Paulo Roberto Falcão, who starred in the 1982 World Cup. He was a smart player, a legend with an elegance rarely seen on a football pitch. The king of assists, he never misplaced a pass or made a mistake.In front of Falcão, I have chosen a ‘super trio’ of attacking midfielders. The first is Rivellino. His elastico move was beautiful, like something from another planet. I love him! He was the best dribbler of a football ever.My other two midfielders are Zico and Rivaldo. Zico was intelligent, had incredible vision and could strike a superb free-kick. A foul around the area was as good as a goal to him. As for Rivaldo, he was a genius. Come on! It was so wonderful to see him with the ball. He played with the same style as Falcão. Rivaldo was brilliant.Picking the two attackers is easy. The first is the best player of all time – Pelé. Do I need to say anything more? The athlete of the century, he scored more than 1,000 goals, and won the World Cup three times. He was complete. I don’t need to say anything more. Pelé is Pelé. No one can beat him.Pelé’s partner up front is Ronaldo. He was incredible too. You had to pay attention to both feet with Ronaldo as they were as good as each other. He was an example to other players, too. He suffered three serious injuries during his career, and was always fighting against these problems. Ronaldo was essential to us in 2002 when we became world champions. The coach for my all-time Brazil team is Mário Zagallo, the manager for the World Cup win in 1970. He would make this team play very well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be20c944ff97a61fddef64c56499ca50df66418/0_229_3937_2363/master/3937.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa426d565838529b18fb97a4d1f25fd0","title":"saudi arabia world cup 2018 team guide tactics key players juan antonio pizzi","story":"Juan Antonio Pizzi has made his side play from the back more and will hope a potent front four can unlock defences in RussiaThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Juan Antonio Pizzi took his place in the Saudi Arabia dugout for the first time in November 2017 yet he is still waiting for his his first competitive game in charge of the Green Falcons - that comes against Russia in the World Cup’s opening match. During his seven-month tenure the Argentinian has packed in as many friendlies as possible to gauge where the side are and what needs to be done before the eyes of the world will be on them on 14 June.During qualification under Bert van Marwijk, the Green Falcons usually played in a 4-3-3, happy to sit back against the better teams, look to hit on the break and get the ball forward quickly. Pizzi has been trying to get the players to play the ball out from the back more. It has worked to a certain extent and there has been a certain tidiness about the team in recent, if low-key, friendly victories over Algeria and Greece, which represented a clear improvement on a 4-0 loss to Belgium in March. The team have been keeping the ball better and moving it quickly. They are also adept at slowing down games, disrupting opponents’ rhythm and being generally frustrating.Pizzi, a former Chile manager, looks likely to play a compact 4-2-3-1, with the attacking three midfielders ready to drop deep to ensure that there are plenty of bodies in midfield.With goals potentially hard to come by, the Green Falcons will focus on being solid. There is experience at the back, though that comes with susceptibility to pace and a lack of exposure to top-class attackers. Osama Hawsawi is the leader in defence, strong and physical, but, at 34, he is slowing down. The good news is that Omar Hawsawi (no relation) next to him has been in excellent form this season. There are also a number of decent options at full-back with players such as Yasser al-Shahrani able to play on either side and get forward quickly.The experienced Taisir al-Jassim will sit alongside the underrated Abdullah Otayf in midfield. Both use the ball well, though the latter may not be able to get forward as much as he would like.The attacking three players are the true standouts. Salem al-Dawsari, Yahya al-Shehri and Fahad al-Muwallad are the team’s creative heartbeat with the ability to unlock Asian defences, though their greatest tests remain. The trio spent the second half of the season on loan to La Liga clubs, recording only two appearances between them.How sharp they are in Russia could determine how the team perform. The two wide players are capable of getting behind defences and, if Shehri can find space behind the main striker, the Green Falcons could cause problems. There is also Nawaf al-Abed, another creative talent who was a mainstay in qualification but the playmaker has struggled with injuries all year.The lack of a regular goalscorer is an issue. Mohammad al-Sahlawi is likely to play up front but there are other options, such as Muhannad Assiri, who is an aerial threat and can hold up the ball better.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Fahad al-Muwallad is an exciting talent and the kind of player fans love to watch, provided he receives the ball in the right areas. If he is given a little freedom by the coach then he has the potential to make things happen and put fans on the edge of their seats.Which player is likely to disappoint?Mohammad al-Sahlawi has an excellent scoring record for his country, averaging well over a goal every other game. There are doubts, however, over whether the striker has the quality to score against top defences.What is the realistic aim for Saudi Arabia at the World Cup and why?This is the side’s first showpiece in 12 years and although most people know it won’t be easy there is some hope, thanks to being placed in one of the easier groups (with Russia, Egypt and Uruguay), that they may sneak a place in the second round. Failing that, not finishing last would be welcomed.Gregory Wilcox writes for Arab News.Follow him on Twitter here.

Only John Ruddy kept more clean sheets than his 22. Right-back: Ryan Fredericks (Fulham) His athleticism was key in transforming defence into attack. Brimming with energy, he has been a three-in-one figurine, adventurous and efficient in both boxes a modern touchline-hugging full-back. Centre-back: Conor Coady (Wolves) After being used at right-back and defensive midfield, Coady has flourished at sweeper in a back three. Monstrous in defence and capable in attack.Centre-back: Sean Morrison (Cardiff City) Neil Warnock has waxed lyrical about Sol Bamba but alongside the Ivorian his captain has been the bedrock of success. Six goals since February helped them clinch promotion too.Left-back: Barry Douglas (Wolves) It is impossible to look beyond the flying Scotsman who, amid the lavish spending, has excelled since a €750,000 move from Konyaspor. Deadly from dead balls, the assist-king proved a bargain. Centre-midfield: Rúben Neves (Wolves) The 21-year-old has oozed class, picking passes for fun and racking up a stunning catalogue of strikes, notably that 35-yard volley against Derby. Centre-midfield: Kevin McDonald (Fulham) The anchorman in Slavisa Jokanovic’s three-man midfield and Fulham would not be the same without him. The streetwise Scot allowed Tom Cairney and Stefan Johansen to thrive.Right wing: Harry Wilson (Hull City) The 21-year-old made a big splash in 14 matches on loan from Liverpool, scoring seven goals. Robert Snodgrass and Junior Hoilett did damage but Wilson singlehandedly lit up a miserable Hull campaign.Attacking midfield: James Maddison (Norwich City) An export from Coventry’s revered academy, he has shimmered in his first full Championship season. Showcased delicate footwork, intricate passing and a knack for the spectacular. Left wing: Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham) His hurtling shuttles have drawn comparisons to Gareth Bale and Marcelo but Sessegnon’s nose for the net (16 goals) is his USP. Capped the season with a cute assist at Wembley.Striker: Bobby Reid (Bristol City) The academy graduate relished the responsibility of leading the line after being pushed further forward by Lee Johnson. A relentless runner, the 25-year-old’s transformation has been seamless.Manager: Neil Warnock (Cardiff City) The marmite Yorkshireman produced his best trick yet in steering Cardiff to the Premier League. A magician when it comes to building team spirit and revitalising also-rans. Goalkeeper: Dean Henderson (Shrewsbury Town) The rapport between the Manchester United loanee and Salop supporters speaks volumes. England Under-21 international made stunning saves look simple – another at Wembley last Sunday. Right-back: Josh Emmanuel (Rotherham United) Another loanee who has relished regular game time, the 20-year-old showed pace and power in abundance. Will fancy his chances of breaking in at Ipswich next season.Centre-back: Toto Nsiala (Shrewsbury) Has had a bumpy ride to becoming a mainstay – he was released by Everton before a stint in Vietnam – but proved a calming presence alongside Omar Beckles.Centre-back: Chey Dunkley (Wigan Athletic) A pillar of the ision’s meanest defence – they shut out Manchester City – he has stood out since arriving on a free from Oxford United.Left-back: Charlie Mulgrew (Blackburn Rovers) The versatile captain has shone in the heart of Tony Mowbray’s backline. Scored 14 goals – six penalties – with his left foot, more than any other defender in the country.Centre-midfield: Graham Carey (Plymouth Argyle) Plymouth’s pearl for the past couple of years, the Irishman has enjoyed another stellar season, helping the club to the verge of the play-offs.Centre-midfield: Bradley Dack (Blackburn) Scooped no fewer than 10 awards in his first season since a £750,000 switch from Gillingham. At last has a chance to prove himself in Championship.Centre-midfield: Nick Powell (Wigan Athletic) Has displayed much of the promise that led Sir Alex Ferguson to talk him up as Paul Scholes’s successor at Old Trafford. An elegant operator, fancied by Brighton.Striker: Brett Pitman (Portsmouth) A serial goalscorer and shrewd summer signing by Kenny Jackett. Hit 23 league goals despite niggling injuries. Striker: Jack Marriott (Peterborough United) Few players’ stock is higher than the 33-goal striker. A revelation since joining from Luton last June, and Posh are resigned to losing their prized asset, a player farmed out to Woking in 2015. Striker: Will Grigg (Wigan Athletic) Followed up making his mark via Northern Ireland supporters’ song with only five league goals in 2016-17. But after conjuring up a good relationship with Powell, has been reborn under manager Paul Cook. Manager: Paul Hurst (Shrewsbury) Guided a team tipped for relegation to the brink of the Championship. Deservedly given a chance to manage higher after signing a three-year deal at Ipswich.Goalkeeper: Marek Stech (Luton Town) Kept 15 clean sheets after leaving Sparta Prague to sign for his former Yeovil Town team-mate Nathan Jones. A gentle giant but also one of Luton’s leaders.Right-back: Jack Stacey (Luton) Another impressive season after starring on loan at Exeter in 2016-17. The 22-year-old former Reading trainee caught the eye with marauding, overlapping runs.Centre-back: Mark Hughes (Accrington Stanley) One half of a watertight partnership alongside Jimmy Dunne, the captain played every minute of their title-winning campaign to help the team to the joint-best defensive record.Centre-back: Adam El-Abd (Wycombe Wanderers) The 33-year-old is settled after a difficult couple of years since leaving boyhood club Brighton. By his own admission, one of a “number of captains” in Gareth Ainsworth’s squad.Left-back: Tom James (Yeovil Town) The reliable Welshman made 51 appearances in his breakthrough season. Former Cardiff trainee, 22, could be the latest to depart for a bigger fish.Centre-midfield: Jorge Grant (Notts County) Joined Nottingham Forest in 2013 via Reading and the Nike Academy. His most recent move, across the Trent, has been his most prosperous, though, with Grant regularly grasping centre stage.Centre-midfield: Tom Bayliss (Coventry City) Coventry’s next big thing, the teenager, who joined aged 12, looks set to follow a well-trodden path. Dancing feet, daring and direct, he made his full debut in December.Centre-midfield: Sean McConville (Accrington) Part of the team that missed automatic promotion by one goal in 2016 and a key cog in getting over the line this time. John Coleman demanded more end product and he delivered.Striker: Billy Kee (Accrington) Kee finished as the ision’s top scorer after an extraordinary year. Has spoken powerfully about his struggles off the pitch but excelled on it.Striker: Mohamed Eisa (Cheltenham Town) A year on from giving Ryman South defenders the runaround, Eisa is one of the Football League’s most prolific strikers. The Sudan-born striker got 25 goals in his first season as a professional.Striker: Marc McNulty (Coventry) Persuaded by Michael Doyle, Coventry’s captain, to join, McNulty scored 28 goals after a stuttering start. Unselfish and savvy.Manager: John Coleman (Accrington) There is an argument that the ebullient scouser’s achievements put Pep Guardiola’s success in the shade. Promotion was a magnificent reward for his hard-working side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f4e1a770543021c4585bf700a2b92bb90e37378/0_1051_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a29ba69dd74b6d7d544b237513ecadf1","title":"fish recipes six of the best turbot salmon kedgeree","story":"Cook up a fish supper with these recipes for stuffed salmon, kedgeree and the very on-topic baked turbotFor the salad1 small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced2 tbsp red wine vinegar500g small waxy potatoes300g green beans, trimmed8 thin rashers smoked streaky bacon (optional)6-8 smoked mackerel fillets, skin and pin-bones removed1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves roughly choppedSalt and black pepper For the dressing2 tsp dijon mustard1 heaped tsp capers (optional)6 tbsp olive oilIn a small bowl, submerge the red onions in the vinegar and leave to marinate for 10 minutes.Cook the potatoes whole in boiling water for 15 minutes or until tender, then drain, peel and cut in half.

Put the turbot on a chopping board, dark side up, and score diagonal slashes heavily across the skin. Fold the bay leaves lengthways and insert them into the slashes.Once the tray is very hot, remove from the oven and drizzle it with oil. Put the fish on the tray and squeeze over the lemon juice, then add another drizzle of oil and a good scattering of salt over the top. Put the fish in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.Once the turbot is out of the oven, scatter the butter over the fish and leave it to melt, then sprinkle over the tarragon. Serve the turbot butter from the roasting dish drizzled over any vegetable sides.The best way to eat the turbot is to use a blunt knife to gently ease the flesh away from the bones, top layer first, then, once that has all gone, pick up the fish by the tail and turn it over to do the same with the underside.

Young people describe how their lives changed dramatically overnightIn her bedroom in Clacton-on-Sea, on the Essex coast, 16-year-old Somer Lawrence perfects her Tim Burton-themed Halloween costume. By the time the night is done, Lawrence will have downed a 70cl bottle of vodka. The Corpse Bride is drunk.In the Cotswolds village of Wotton-under-Edge, 29-year-old Lee Peters manages to play the piano in his flat, despite having consumed an entire bottle of gin.In Malia, Crete, 18-year-old Stuart Marshall celebrates the end of his lads’ holiday by drinking five half-pints of spirits.Meanwhile, 23-year-old Rebecca Charles enjoys the sunshine with friends at the beach. They bring cider, beer and wine. By nightfall, she will have drunk 35 units of alcohol.What all these stories have in common is what happened next. Charles woke up at 5am and was sick straight away. Marshall’s friends found him curled up in a ball. Lawrence was rushed to hospital. Peters was carried out of his house on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance after a neighbour called 999.They had all developed pancreatitis, a disease brought on by excessive alcohol consumption that can turn one night in the pub, or a day at the beach, into a life-altering illness – it can often be fatal.“You can get pancreatitis after a single binge,” says Dr Sarah Jarvis of the campaign group Drinkaware, although she explains it’s more common to develop it after repeated binges.After the sudden death of the Swedish DJ Avicii, pancreatitis is becoming better known. He had been afflicted by the condition after abusing alcohol during exhausting world tours and, after his death, his family issued a statement saying “he could not go on any longer”. His death has forced us to pay attention to a condition we would perhaps rather ignore.In the UK in 2016, 7,327 people died of a range of conditions that could be directly attributed to alcohol abuse. While the number of direct alcohol-related deaths have been relatively constant since 2013, they are higher than they were in 2001, when 5,701 people died as a direct result of alcohol abuse. English alcohol-related hospital admissions are at a record high – up two-thirds from a decade ago – while spending on alcohol support services has been cut.Peters, Lawrence and Charles all now have chronic pancreatitis. “In the town I lived in, drinking was a massive part of the culture,” says Charles, who is now 31. “Everybody else was doing it. But I wasn’t getting up in the morning and drinking – the way people imagine alcoholics behave. I was just too much of a party girl.”“I was stupid and young,” says Lawrence, who is now 20. Although she went to hospital several times after the incident at her Halloween party, Lawrence continued drinking, and developed chronic pancreatitis at 17. She began drinking aged 14 because it eased her anxiety and depression. “I’d turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism,” she says. “I’d always be the one at the party who’d had the most to drink. It gave me liquid confidence.”She isn’t alone. “Wine had this lovely, numbing quality to it,” Peters says. Now aged 34, he began binge drinking after being violently assaulted at 16. “It was absolutely a response to trauma. It was the self-medication tool I used when things got stressful.”Alcohol abuse is often linked to mental ill health. “Drug and alcohol use can lead to mental health problems, and vice versa,” says Dr Cyrus Abbasian, a consultant psychiatrist at St George’s, University of London, who specialises in mental health and substance abuse. He explains that alcohol is an anxiolytic, meaning that it has a sedative effect. “You’re self-medicating your mental health condition,” he says. “Alcohol leads to short-term relief of anxiety, but it doesn’t treat the underlying problem.” Over time, a person may develop alcohol dependency, alongside their existing, untreated mental health issues.In a difficult relationship, and with postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, Charles fell in with a party-loving crowd. “You think the alcohol is making things better,” she says. “But it’s actually making things worse.”Some argue that minimum-unit pricing, implemented in Scotland earlier this month, would tackle the problem of at-home drinkers who take advantage of cheap supermarket offers. “Minimum unit pricing is an excellent idea,” Abbasian says, “because it’s an evidence-based public health intervention. With any drug, you need to limit supply and increase price to reduce use. If something is cheaply and easily available, people tend to use it.” In some instances, supermarkets had been selling alcoholic drinks more cheaply than the same quantity of water.But would minimum-unit pricing have deterred Lawrence, who would drink a bottle of vodka because she was too young to get into bars? Possibly. “When you’re young, you can’t get into pubs, so you get a bottle of vodka for seven or eight pounds,” she says. “I don’t know why we thought it was necessary to be drinking spirits. Why were we drinking vodka at 15 or 16? It’s what everybody did, so it’s what I did.”We all have friends who push things too far. They’re the ones with cracked phone screens and jeroboam-sized hangovers on Sunday mornings. Their anecdotes of drunken misadventures make you laugh, but also make you queasy.Or maybe you’re that friend. “People drink so much because it’s our culture,” adds Lawrence. “The sun comes out and you go to a beer garden. It’s what we do. Everything is just an excuse to drink. Life is hard for everybody, so it’s nice to have an escape.”But Jarvis believes if people were aware of the health consequences of binge drinking, they would drink less. “Most people have no idea that you may be doing yourself damage now that can last a lifetime.”Here’s something to make binge-drinkers pause mid-sip: pancreatitis hurts. “It’s like the worst stomach ache you’ve ever had,” Marshall says.When your pancreas begins to fail, the pain never goes away. After her pancreatitis turned chronic, Charles’s pancreas stopped producing the enzymes she needed to digest food, causing her to become malnourished. Her weight dropped to 29kg (63lb). She can’t work full-time or look after her 10-year-old daughter. On good days, she showers and does laundry. The bad days are dark. “I think: ‘I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.’”Life becomes small. Drinking buddies melt away faster than ice in a spritzer on a warm summer day. “It’s lonely,” Charles says, “when you’re surrounded by people who party the whole time and you don’t want to be a part of that any more. It’s like they don’t want to know you.”Peters also lives alone. A kindly neighbour checks up on him. “She has dug me out of some dark places,” he says. When he goes out, his emaciated frame attracts pitying looks. “It’s difficult because I used to be a good-looking chap with a decent body that people would comment on.” But not being able to work takes the biggest toll. “I feel quite ashamed by it,” Peters, a former accountant, says. “Having to go from being fiercely independent to being dependent on the state doesn’t sit well with me.”After we talk on the phone, Peters emails me a list of the 14 medicines he takes daily, and the 25 symptoms he experiences. (“Constant, debilitating pain … regular sepsis.”) “I can sense the grim reaper approaching,” Peters writes, before signing off with a cheerful reminder not to work too hard.How does he bear it? Keeping his mind occupied helps. So do antidepressants. Knowing that he caused his disease, Peters says, “is difficult to cope with”. After his first bout of pancreatitis, Peters kept drinking. “It’s difficult to explain why,” he says, pointing to the trauma of his early attack as a partial explanation. He also felt that doctors were possibly exaggerating the severity of his condition, out of overcautiousness.“It’s hard to explain what makes people unable to stop drinking,” says Abbasian. “With some patients, I have a conversation with them, and they say: ‘Yes, doctor, if I drink, I’ll have pancreatitis and I’ll die.’ But they don’t find other things as pleasurable and, because of their underlying anxiety disorder, they continue to self-medicate.”Peters says: “I have tried very hard to come up with a rational reason as to why I was so neglectful and blase about my health, but there’s nothing I can come up with that will make sense to anybody. I’ve been very foolish. I made those decisions and I’m aware I made them. I thought: ‘Hell, sod it, I’ll think about it tomorrow.’ But tomorrow catches up with you. It caught up with me, big time.”Chronic pancreatitis has no cure. Many people with the condition go on to develop pancreatic cancer. Surgical procedures are sometimes necessary. Charles’s gallbladder has been removed and doctors have performed a coeliac plexus block on her – an injection made using local anaesthetic to treat severe abdominal pain. Peters has advanced-stage chronic pancreatitis and takes prescription painkillers, including morphine, as well as enzyme replacement drugs, anti-sickness medication, anti-seizure medications, proton-pump inhibitors to reduce the acid in his stomach, anti-constipation tablets and meal-replacement drinks.Despite all these interventions, about one in five people with pancreatitis will die within five years of their diagnosis. “I have a terminal prognosis,” Peters says quietly. “I have gone downhill quite rapidly in the last six months. Lots of treatments don’t work any more. I’m literally wasting away.” A few days after we speak, Peters experiences projectile vomiting, a fever and excruciating pain and is admitted to hospital with an acute flare-up of pancreatitis.It’s easy to be judgmental about Peters’ situation. You may think: why didn’t he just stop drinking when his doctors warned him? But trauma makes people behave irrationally. Rape survivors become promiscuous, intelligent people ignore medical advice, the children of alcoholics binge-drink.And even if you have never experienced trauma yourself, not drinking in our culture is hard. “My friends are drunk all the time and they’ll be in the club buying me drinks,” Lawrence says. “They don’t realise the severity of my illness because they don’t have to live with it.” Charles gets angry when she sees people being peer-pressured. “People will taunt someone who isn’t drinking,” she says. “It’s like: you’re a weirdo if you don’t drink.”“Humans are social animals, but we don’t like to be around a lot of people we’re not familiar with,” Abbasian says. “Socialising, going out on a Saturday, is anxiety-provoking. When you go to a bar or club, you drink to reduce anxiety levels so you can drink and talk to strangers. Alcohol disinhibits you.”Forced sobriety at least helps you to see things anew, in a clear-eyed way. “I notice everything on nights out – I’m not blind to things any more,” Marshall says. “Even with some of my friends, I think: you turn into a wanker when you’re drunk.”Abbasian says: “If alcohol were a relatively new drug introduced into our society, and not as socially acceptable, it would be a class A drug, similar to heroin or cocaine.” He urges those who regularly binge drink to seek assistance, before it’s too late. “There’s a lot of stigma and denial. A major first step is to accept you have a problem and not be ashamed getting help and treatment.”All the people I spoke to wanted me to share their experiences. In fact, many of them reached out to me, desperate to warn others.“My message is: be careful,” Charles says. “Just because you’re young and you only go on weekend benders, and don’t drink every day, doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Because you’re not.”And the next time you drop a crate of sticky bottles off at a recycling bank, Peters would ask that you remember him and reconsider your drinking. “If just one person can read this and think that, it would be enough for me,” he says. “Just to make a difference to that person and their family. It would be my whole life’s work complete for me. I would be over the moon.”Drinkaware is an independent UK charity working to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.

Originally created by the great French chef Auguste Escoffier during his spell in charge of the kitchens at the Savoy in London, and named in honour of opera star Dame Nellie Melba, in residence at the hotel while performing at Covent Garden, its fame quickly spread beyond the confines of WC2 – helped along, no doubt, by the immense celebrity of both parties.Yet the dish stands on its own merits, too: this glorious combination of tangy peach and softer, sweeter raspberry brings out the best in both fruits, which are taken to even greater heights by the cool, creamy pleasures of vanilla ice-cream. As the great man himself wrote, “Pêche Melba is a simple dish,” but he went on to warn that “any variation … ruins the delicate balance of its taste.” Is the world’s first master chef right – or, 125 years after its creation, could this classic do with updating?At the height of summer, you might well get away with using raw peaches, so ripe they need nothing in the way of sugar, as Margaret Costa suggests in her Four Seasons Cookery Book, but given the rarity of this occurrence in the UK, it makes sense to have a contingency plan. In any case, lovely as fuzzy peach skins are, Escoffier would never have allowed them past the pass. He calls for the fruit to be blanched and then dunked into iced water, so the skins can be slipped off and the fruit simply sugared to draw out its juices, although Bruno Neveu, former pastry chef at the Ritz-Escoffier cooking school in Paris, poaches them, too, perhaps because raw peaches are judged to have a little too much in the way of texture to allow elegant consumption.Poaching the fruit in syrup is fairly standard in modern recipes, although the medium varies: Nigel Slater counsels moderation with the sugar: “Too often, they come out cloyingly sweet.” He also adds a squeeze of lemon juice and a twist of peel, as does Diana Henry, who suggests making the syrup with dry white wine rather than water. Barbara Cartland, whose pink-jacketed masterwork, The Romance of Food, the best present I’ve received in the past 12 months, shows no such restraint, and indeed, it pays off: the fruit isn’t in the syrup long enough to become sickly (five minutes to Henry’s 15-20), which means it remains pleasingly firm, too.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall tops his peaches with sugar and butter, and bakes them instead in his River Cottage Fruit Every Day: it does indeed make them “extra rich and toffeeish”, but also leaves them rather mushy – and none of us is quite sure how we feel about hot peaches (see also crumble), although he reckons the contrast in temperature is “a key factor in this gorgeous pud”.We all enjoy Escoffier’s blanched and sugared peaches: they still have the juicy, plump texture of the ripe fruit, as well as being far more economical with the sugar. If your peaches are really under-ripe, however, I’d recommend poaching them for about five minutes in a syrup made from 150g sugar and 300ml water, perhaps with some lemon zest, vanilla or even a bay leaf if you’re feeling daring.Slater claims that “peaches need to be poached with their skins on”, but both Cartland and Richard Olney disagree. They must have more patience than me, however (or, in Cartland’s case, a personal chef, Nigel Gordon), because a ripe peach is a pain indeed to peel. Much easier to blanch them as Escoffier and Neveu recommend.The variety of peach is more important than one might think: both Grigson and Henry prefer a white-fleshed fruit, but these tend to lack the acidity that plays off so nicely against the other ingredients: a standard yellow peach is both easier to come by and works better (save the white kind for bellinis). Nectarines, which I also try, seem to hang on to their skins more jealously than their furry cousins.If you can’t find any peaches – and Escoffier is clear that this must be made with “tender and very ripe peaches” – but have a yearning for a peach melba all the same, Olney allows that “home-canned peaches are respectable”, and I suspect he would also have given top-quality jarred fruit the grudging nod. The tinned kind tend to be watery and overcooked, but I can highly recommend the “hand-peeled Miraflores” fruit from Spanish brand El Navarrico, and no doubt other equally good versions are available.The special genius of this dish, for me, is the vivid red raspberry sauce that clings to the peeled peaches like a new and sweeter skin – again, you might get lucky and find fruit so stupidly ripe that it needs little more than crushing and sieving before use, but it’s more likely that you’ll need to sweeten it. Most recipes call for caster or icing sugar, which dissolves more easily in the pureed fruit, but Cartland uses currant jelly and kirsch, and Slater some of the poaching syrup, which feels like a clever way of putting it to use if you have it (if you go down the poaching road, leftover syrup is also very nice with some cold white wine or soda water). Currant jelly has a certain tang to it that helps to bring out the flavour of the berries, but Fearnley-Whittingstall’s lemon juice tastes fresher to us. (Again, Olney comes to the rescue of out-of-season cooks, advising the use of frozen raspberries that “still recall the flavour of the fresh”: make sure you defrost them first, though, or you’ll end up with a loose sorbet.)Unfortunately, you do need to sieve the sauce: this sounds like a faff, and you’ll lose a little of the flesh along the way – although they are edible, raspberry seeds are not terribly nice once isolated from their natural home, and also have an irritating tendency to lodge themselves in the teeth. Fearnley-Whittingstall’s recipe, which folds whole fruit into the sauce at the end, gives it the texture of the fresh berries and the heightened flavour of a puree.Cartland, the woman who spawned a thousand slender, willowy heroines, doesn’t even hint at the forbidden pleasures of ice-cream in her recipe, but Escoffier is explicit: the dish must start with a silver timbale full of vanilla ice-cream, and it’s hard to improve upon that idea, although we are rather taken with Henry’s alternative of lightly sweetened creme fraiche, especially if well chilled I suspect a scoop of proper frozen yoghurt (not the low-fat variety) would also be delicious. Try to use an ice-cream that isn’t too sweet: it shouldn’t overwhelm the fruit.Olney argues that peach melba “depends on three things only for it to rank among the finest of classical French desserts: the honesty of the ice-cream, flavourful peaches that have been freshly poached in a syrup containing only water and sugar, and a sauce that is nothing but a puree of fresh raspberries. The best whipped cream in the world only detracts. The only acceptable refinement is the sprinkling of a few sliced fresh almonds over the surface.” And while I may disagree on several points, he’s right about the almonds at least: they add a very gratifying crunch of which I’m sure Escoffier himself would have approved, if only he’d wasted less time chasing celebrities.4 ripe peaches4 tbsp sugar2 tbsp flaked almonds300g raspberries (thawed if frozen)1 tbsp icing sugar1 tsp lemon juice8 scoops good vanilla ice-creamBlanch the peaches in a pan of boiling water for a minute, then lift them out with a slotted spoon and dunk into iced water. Once they’re cool enough to handle, slip off their skins, cut in half and discard the stones.Put the peach halves in a shallow dish, sprinkle over the sugar, then set aside for about an hour, preferably in the fridge, turning once. Meanwhile, toast the almonds until lightly golden and leave to cool.Whizz two-thirds of the raspberries with the icing sugar and a tablespoon of lemon juice, then adjust to taste and push through a fine sieve to make a smooth sauce. Stir in the remaining 100g raspberries and put in the fridge until you’re ready to eat.To serve, put two peach halves in each dish and top with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Pour the sauce over the top and finish with a sprinkling of flaked almonds.• Peach melba: a retro classic, or a fussy French waste of perfectly good fruit?

Each is also short-listed for a creative hub if it fails to secure the main prize of the new headquarters.The new HQ, which will operate alongside Channel 4’s £100m London base in Victoria, will have facilities including a TV studio, and host executive and board meetings.Channel 4, which has said the shift of staff and resource out of London is the biggest structural change in its 35-year history, has also shortlisted six smaller cities that are only eligible to battle to be the home of the two new creative hubs up for grabs.These are Belfast, Brighton, Newcastle-Gateshead, Nottingham, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent.The broadcaster has said its second main base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure.West Midlands mayor Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss, said he was pleased his region had overcome the “first hurdle” in the bidding process. The West Midlands has been selected as a candidate for the national HQ or a creative hub.“Now the hard work really starts as we begin negotiations in earnest to develop the most compelling case possible to the broadcaster,” Street said.Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson pitched his city as a “soulmate” for Channel 4.“This is a hotly contested bidding competition and to reach this next stage in the process demonstrates Liverpool’s pulling power as a location that offers businesses and their employees a great worklife balance,” he said. Channel 4 said it received more than 30 submissions in the first round of its relocation process.“After careful consideration by the Channel 4 executive team, we’ve selected 13 cities that are best able to meet our vision for our new hubs in the nations and regions,” said Jonathan Allan, Channel 4’s chief commercial officer, who is running the pitch process. “We look forward to visiting all those on the shortlist as part of our second phase, but we will also be continuing to work with all cities and regions as part of our strategy to increase investment and support creative businesses, jobs and growth across the UK.”Channel 4 News will also open three new news bureaux, with a trebling of news jobs in the nations and regions by 2020, while spend on shows made by production companies based outside London will rise from £169m annually to about £350m a year by 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

website viagogo singled out by uk government","story":"Secondary ticketing website referred to National Trading Standards by ASANational Trading Standards has opened an investigation into the ticket website Viagogo for persistently misleading consumers, hours after the digital minister, Margot James, urged consumers to boycott the company.In a rare move by a government minister to single out a particular company for its behaviour, James advised anyone planning to buy tickets on resale websites: “Don’t choose Viagogo – they are the worst.”Her warning came as the Advertising Standards Authority referred the controversial company to National Trading Standards, citing a series of transgressions breaching the UK’s advertising code.The ASA accused Viagogo of misleading consumers by failing to be transparent about extra fees added to the ticket prices it displays online, despite previous warnings from the regulator.It also hit out at the firm’s use of the phrase “official site”, which it said led consumers to believe Viagogo was an authorised primary ticket agent rather than a resale site.The ASA chief executive, Guy Parker, said: “Viagogo was given clear warning and handed the opportunity to play fair with consumers by removing misleading pricing information from its website its failure to do so means it will now face the consequences.“Where an advertiser or business is unwilling or unable to follow the advertising rules we will act.“In light of Viagogo’s inability to get its house in order, we’re referring it to National Trading Standards to consider appropriate action.”Immediate sanctions imposed by the ASA include a request to the search engines Google and Bing to remove some of the Geneva-based company’s listings.It has also added Viagogo to a list of non-compliant companies and launched an advertising campaign highlighting its behaviour.However, National Trading Standards has far more options available to it, including the power to impose fines and imprison staff.A spokesperson for NTS said it would “look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law”.Viagogo has also been threatened with court action by the Competition and Markets Authority, which is looking into alleged breaches of consumer rights law by the site.Increased scrutiny of Viagogo follows a series of high-profile controversies involving the website run by the US multimillionaire Eric Baker, the co-founder of the company’s biggest rival StubHub.The singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran recently cancelled 10,000 tickets for his tour that had been bought through Viagogo.Sheeran’s promotion company Kilimanjaro Live, among those to file complaints about the company with the ASA, said Viagogo was the only resale firm not to comply with its request not to resell tickets for the artist’s shows.Earlier this month, the  revealed Viagogo’s involvement in the resale of football tickets in the UK, resulting in fans being overcharged and seated in the wrong end, undermining strict laws on segregation.The website has also been criticised for withholding refunds from overcharged fans, profiteering from charity events, refusing to attend a select committee hearing and breaching consumer rights laws.Claire Turnham, who launched a campaign called Victim of Viagogo to secure refunds for the company’s customers, called for decisive action against the company.“We’ve had lots of talking and now we need action,” said Turnham, who has helped Viagogo customers reclaim around £300,000 from the company in less than two years.“It needs to be clear, it needs to be strong and it needs to be swift.“If sanctions are imposed through Google, it will stop people being ripped off because people every day are finding themselves in this very sad and unfortunate position.”The security and ticketing expert Reg Walker said he believed efforts by artists such as Sheeran to battle Viagogo were already hitting the company in the pocket.“From the information we’ve received in the past week, it looks like they’re looking at refunds of around £250,000 for Ed Sheeran shows alone,” he said.Viagogo’s early investors include the tennis power couple Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury goods group Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the financier Jacob Rothschild, the German media mogul Herbert Kloiber and the London-based investment group Index Ventures. has approached the investors for

traviata opera holland park review verdi","story":"Opera Holland Park, LondonRodula Gaitanou’s thoughtful production brings insight and clarity to Verdi’s tragedyRodula Gaitanou’s new production of La Traviata for Opera Holland Park opens not with Verdi’s prelude but with the alarming sound of laboured breathing, of someone gasping for air and life. It’s a provocative start to a thoughtful, troubling interpretation that carefully and insistently reminds us that the opera’s tragedy lies in its confrontation with encroaching mortality.When the familiar opening string phrases steal in, we encounter Lauren Fagan’s Violetta spitting blood, while her maid, Anina (Ellie Edmonds), prepares her for the party at which her world will be overturned when she meets Matteo Desole’s gauchely attractive Alfredo. We are in the decadent fin-de-siècle Paris of Proust, where time is rapidly running out. Cordelia Chisholm’s set, meanwhile, resembles a glasshouse, where Violetta is displayed like some exquisite bloom admired for her beauty but discarded when it fades. When she surrenders Alfredo to Stephen Gadd’s smugly moralistic Germont père, her consumption immediately reasserts its grip. At the end, Anina and Doctor Grenvil (Henry Grant Kerswell) hover at her bedside, overseeing a death for which, we suddenly realise, they have been preparing all along.Musically, it’s extremely strong. Matthew Kofi Waldren, conducting the City of London Sinfonia, propels the score urgently forward, admirably avoiding sentimentality. Fagan, one of today’s finest young sopranos, is exceptional throughout and a superb actor. Her tone blazes with existential defiance and desperation, and she possesses both the agility for act one – Sempre Libera is capped by a dazzling top E flat – and the dramatic weight for the closing scenes. Desole’s passion and sullen rage are entirely convincing, though a bit more dynamic variation in his singing would not go amiss. Gadd hectors his music on occasion, but is tremendously dignified and authoritative in the second act finale. The smaller roles – including Laura Woods’ dominatrixy Flora, Charne Rochford’s vapid Gastone and Nicholas Garrett’s arrogant Douphol – are all cast from strength and really register as characters for once, which is a measure both of Opera Holland Park’s high ensemble values and Gaitanou’s painstaking direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2811fc2c9f41ba9159a0054b9b7bb8306941eb23/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768b0ba67806377ce351ad580b30d452","title":"thailand punks against junta repression military political","story":"Anger at repression is quelled under the military dictatorship – but the country’s punk scene is turning the protest volume back up again“It’s been four years, motherfucker!” – this is how a group of Thai punks promoted their gig, earlier this month, marking the fourth anniversary of military rule in the country.The provocative slogan, directed at junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, helped the event’s Facebook page go viral, piquing the interest of pro-democracy activists and putting the small underground scene in the national spotlight.A larger than usual crowd showed up at the concert, which was held at a monument commemorating student-led protests in 1973. Those protests succeeded in bringing down a despised military dictatorship – but only after troops opened fire on the crowds, killing at least 77.Such atrocities are a recurring horror in Thailand, where the state also killed its own people in 1976, 1992 and in 2010, when around 90 pro-democracy “red shirt” protesters were killed during military crackdowns led by General Prayuth.However, in 2014, Prayuth sat back and watched as rival protests against the elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, whom the red shirts supported, paralysed Bangkok. When he finally did intervene, it was not to support the government but to seize power himself. Although the junta has its supporters, opposition is widespread and only kept in check by oppression. Elections have been promised for 2019, but even if they do go ahead, the signs are that Prayuth is aiming to use them as a way to legitimise his power and remain in control. Outside the gig, uniformed police stood guard but allowed people to move in and out freely. Undercover agents worked inside, filming and taking photos. Among the crowd of punk kids were some stalwarts from the pro-democracy movement, keen to take part in any activity against the junta, even if it meant subjecting their ears to noisy and strange music. I recognised a group of older women – referred to as “aunties” in Thai — whom I knew to be red shirt activists.One of them, a nurse in her 60s from just outside Bangkok, told me she had no idea about punk – Thai country music is more her style – but she came along because she’s angry about the state of the country. “It’s been four years of military rule now,” she complained. “We need elections.”As bands such as Shock Shuck and Drunk All Day treated the crowd to three-chord riffs and four-letter expletives aimed at Prayuth, I chatted to one of the event organisers. “The Thai punk scene in the past has only cared about partying,” hesays. “I organised this event because I think punk should be rebellious. I care about freedom and rights.”The thrash metal band Killing Fields certainly don’t play party music. Their lyrics and imagery deal with dark periods of Thai history, such as the massacre of students at Thammasat University in 1976, which is still quite a taboo subject in Thailand. A gruesome photo from the atrocity will be familiar to fans of the US punk band Dead Kennedys.Blood Soaked Street of Social Decay and Anarthipathai (Thai for anarchy) aren’t light entertainment either. Both bands played blistering sets of politically charged grindcore that got the crowd slam-dancing, with dozens of pairs of Dr Martens, Converse and Vans stomping furiously on an anti-Prayuth banner laid out on the ground.Mhee, the drummer and spokesperson of Blood Soaked Street of Social Decay – often styled as BxSxSxSxD – is pessimistic about Thailand’s political prospects. “The whole world is moving on but we are still stuck in the same place,” he told me, referring to the country’s vicious cycle of elections, coups, protests and massacres. He distrusts all forms of authority but concedes that “democracy is the ‘least worst’ system because it allows for accountability. With a dictatorship, you can’t check on them or criticise them.”Music hasn’t been this political in Thailand since the tumult of the 1970s, when bands such as Caravan grew out of the popular uprising and pioneered a wave of socially conscious folk-rock, known in Thai as “songs for life”. But after the trauma of the 1976 student massacre, the progressive movement grew weary and the counterculture soon faded away.Since the 80s, Thai music has been dominated by bland pop and soft rock, churning out love songs with the same sugary vocal delivery. When youth cultures were imported from overseas – punk, metal, indie, hip-hop – the style was imitated flawlessly but the sense of rebellion often seemed to have been lost along the way. “Thai kids just aren’t interested in politics” is a common refrain.But a deep and protracted political crisis has convulsed Thailand for more than a decade now. And while the younger generation seemed uninterested at first, there are signs that this could be changing. Since the 2014 coup, young Thais have been bravely leading the small but determined resistance movement against it.And if punk isn’t your thing, then politics has been popping up in other youthful cultural forms, too: a quarter of a million people follow the satirical comic strips of “kai meow” (cat’s balls) on Facebook a vibrant street-art scene has started targeting the junta with murals hobbyists make politically themed designer toys that can sell out in minutes, and a young gender activist recently made a retro-style board game that mocks the country’s regressive politics.Such examples might not be indicative of what the average young Thai is doing, but that’s the point. These are the creatives, the social influencers and trend setters – being subversive is what the cool kids are doing.Mhee thinks the internet has given people a greater voice. “Young people have always been interested in politics,” he says. “But now they have a space to convey what they think to the public, so other people can support their opinion.”Social media certainly helped the bands at the “four years” gig reach a wider audience first when promoting the concert, and then afterwards, when clips and photos of the event’s dramatic climax went viral.As headliners Anarthipathai finished their set, attempts were made to set the anti-Prayuth banner on fire, but it proved remarkably resilient to the flames – a perfect metaphor for a country struggling to rid itself of a stubborn dictator.To accommodate the delay, the band moved effortlessly from D-beat to slow psych jam, giving two punks more time to douse the banner in lighter fluid to get it burning. When the flames finally engulfed the dictator’s face, the crowd cheered and the show was over.The police immediately swooped in to make arrests. A dozen or so punks were shepherded on to the back of a police pickup while the crowd berated the officers.“Only in Thailand! This country has no freedom!” screeched one of the red shirt aunties.“Are you proud of yourself? Are you proud of the job you do?” shouted a young punk woman at the police.The atmosphere was tense but as the vehicle pulled out, a grinning punk in the back shouted: “Democracy for ever!” and a huge cheer filled the air, followed by laughter. Punk’s been through a lot over the decades but it’s not dead yet, at least not for the people who still believe in it – and the same is true for Thai democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9d2bf7edb2942d60d194777ce5b32ccead8e5/0_44_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db58ba5270d4fb116e1c83238c16b12","title":"off the wall pin up posters from glam to new wave","story":"From David Bowie to X-Ray Spex, Richard Hell to Suzi Quatro, a new book collates some of the best posters of the 1970s and 80s to be tacked up in teenage bedrooms everywhere"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a6b86f5af61e9f35552eedded2d02aa9d2c131/0_0_4176_2778/master/4176.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e86e6cfff9824d418fc360980a019a43 1400w","title":"brexit uk may get poorer access than israel to eu science scheme","story":"Exclusive: UK may have to pay more for privilege of collaborating, draft paper saysTheresa May’s appeal for a special Brexit deal on science and research collaboration, worth billions to the British economy, is being stonewalled by Brussels as it prepares to offer an arrangement less privileged and more expensive than that given to non-EU states such as Israel.The European commission’s negotiators refused to discuss the issue in formal talks last week, instead insisting they would present the UK with conditions of entry for a “third country” into its €97.9bn research programme once they had been formally published. A draft copy of the so-called Horizon Europe document, seen by the , suggests that the UK is set to be offered less generous access than countries with associate status in the current programme, known as Horizon 2020, including Israel, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine.Those states, along with countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – will be “associated to all programme parts” of the new research and science framework, of which details are to be published on 7 June, according to the leaked document.It is understood that wealthy countries with a developed research and development capacity are to be offered a greater opportunity to pay in and collaborate with the EU under a reform of the current programme, which will end in 2020.However, the UK is set to join Canada and South Korea in the category of countries that will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating, while being barred from a particular raft of programmes designed to encourage innovation.According to the draft paper, so-called “third countries” will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, which sets priorities, and their companies will not have the opportunity to apply for “fast, flexible grants and co-investments” designed to “bridge the ‘valley of death’ between research, commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies”.Sources said it was additionally unclear what role the UK would have in shaping the priorities of Horizon Europe after Brexit, given it would no longer be a member state and would not be an EFTA member, acceding country, candidate country or potential candidate country.The European commission’s proposals will need to be approved by the member states. A senior EU official said they were aware that the UK would seek to change the rules from within during negotiations over the bloc’s future budget, known as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).An EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations said of last week’s talks with the UK negotiators in Brussels: “We … had a discussion on science and technology where we said that from our point of view unfortunately this was slightly early as we are coming forward in early June with the proposals for the next generation of Horizon Europe, the successor to Horizon 2020, and these programmes will set out the conditions for third countries’ participation.“We would be happy to present that to the UK once that has been published. We take good note that the UK wants to maintain its role in shaping and priority setting of EU programmes in the future, and we also took very careful note of the announcement by the UK negotiators that they intend to use their part in the EU28 negotiations about the future MFF as an instrument to influence the definition of third country part rules in EU programmes.”Last week a British presentation to the EU negotiators, who were led by Michel Barnier, argued for full access to Horizon Europe and said “as an associate country we would look to agree an appropriate level of influence on the shape of the programme. This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK’s contribution.” Thomas Jørgensen, the senior policy coordinator at the European University Association (EUA) working on Brexit-related issues, said the commission was acting to protect its interests in the face of the emergence of the UK as a rival economic power.He said: “It is entirely understandable that you would want to help small countries in your neighbourhood, but why would you do that for small and medium-size enterprises in South Korea or other third countries such as the UK?“The view from Brussels is that leaving the EU is the UK’s choice, it is their choice to be South Korea. If they say they want a special deal, that’s not going to work.”Jørgensen said, however, that the scale of the UK’s research strength was such that it would inevitably have a large say in at least informal settings about the direction of the programmes.He said: “There is elasticity. But if it comes down to a matter of principles, then that could be a problem.”Diplomats attached to the member states suggested there were additional concerns about giving third countries access to sensitive research information. The UK is seeking an agreement to continue the flow of data between it and the rest of Europe, but a recent report on the country’s handling of personal information held on the Schengen Information System, designed to monitor the flow of people around Europe, has damaged that case.An official paper, dated 18 May 2018 and seen by the , reveals that despite a 2015 evaluation finding serious deficiencies with the UK’s handling of personal data, a follow-up visit in 2017 had discovered that a range of recommendations had not been implemented.The report notes that the EU’s inspectors had found that “very serious deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS by the UK subsist”.Among the issues that caused concern was the discovery that UK officials had been copying personal data and sharing it with US contractors working for its immigration services and the border police. Some of that information was found to be out of date as well, raising the potential of people being unfairly flagged as they passed through the UK’s borders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/746e8c6f6bb45fc8890c24c99a5e9ae1bc208b02/262_39_3095_1858/master/3095.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d19201d68a388564dad7c6b8a17c3f58","title":"caroline lucas to step down as green party co leader","story":"Brighton MP says she has helped stabilise party and it is time for others to step forwardCaroline Lucas has announced she will stand down as co-leader of the Greens in the autumn, saying it is time for others in the party to step forward and widen the pool of its prominent figures.Lucas, for years the party’s sole nationally recognisable politician as well as its only MP, returned for a second stint as leader in 2016 on a joint ticket with Jonathan Bartley, who leads the opposition group on Lambeth council in south London.The party requires it leaders to re-stand every two years, and Lucas told the  that while she remained committed to her Brighton Pavilion constituency, she would not be continuing in the co-leader role.“I think making space for other people at this point is a straightforward thing to do and a good thing to do,” she said. “We have a wonderful array of talent in the party and I would love the opportunity for more of that to be showcased.” Nominations for the leadership and for a series of other senior party positions will be open during June, and there will be a vote in August. Bartley has previously said he does not wish to be sole leader, and it is possible he could seek a joint ticket with another candidate. Other contenders could include Siân Berry, a member of the London assembly, and Cleo Lake, a Bristol councillor newly made the city’s lord mayor.Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its previous system of two “principal speakers”, and she increased her prominence further when she became an MP in 2010. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett, who endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.Lucas said she and Bartley had stabilised the party since then and introduced “a far greater culture of professionalism” during a period in which the party’s vote share was squeezed as Labour moved to the left.“It’s no secret that we knew Jeremy Corbyn was going to take a lot of the space that we’ve been carving out for ourselves, so these were going to be challenging times and perhaps it was more important than ever to have at least one of our leaders in parliament,” she said. In an article for the  explaining her decision, Lucas argues she and Bartley are leaving the party in an improved position. “We focused relentlessly on electing Greens across the country. That’s meant more train journeys for me and Jonathan than I care to recall – which might explain why we’re both so passionate about public ownership of the railways,” she writes.“The effects are already clear – our best local election results ever earlier this month, bringing the Green party to every corner of this country, and seeing us break on to new councils as erse as Birmingham, Burnley and Richmond. The polls have now seen us overtake Ukip, and we’re closing in on the Lib Dems too.”When it was announced that she and Bartley would lead jointly, the idea was mocked by many. Lucas said another achievement had been to show this could work: “I think we’ve really demonstrated something very important with this model. I remember a lot of people saying this isn’t going to work. I think we’ve demonstrated that it is not only workable but positively desirable and effective.”She said this time she would not return. “I make it a point of principle never to rule anything out, but I cannot conceivably imagine at the moment any circumstance in which the party would be asking me to come back for a third time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bab73b40633d3f5b873e5d3eb61b55ee7e85e04c/0_168_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67df1292e51ba90c321bf40f0ef13258","title":"womens voices drop by two piano notes after pregnancy","story":"New mothers’ voices are lower and more monotone for about a year after the birthThe voices of new mothers temporarily drop by more than two musical notes after pregnancy, scientists have claimed.Researchers from the University of Sussex found new mothers’ voices become lower and more monotonous after they have had their first baby.However, this “vocal masculinising” does not appear permanent, the team said – with voices reverting to previous frequency after one year.They speculate the change may be an attempt to sound more authoritative in response to the new role of parent, or could be driven by hormones. Lead researcher Dr Kasia Pisanski, of the University of Sussex’s School of Psychology, said: “Our results show that, despite some singers noticing that their voices get lower while pregnant, the big drop actually happens after they give birth.” The study examined 20 mothers, including singers, actresses, journalists and celebrities, and compared them to a control group. The women’s highest pitch also dropped by an average of 2.2 semitones, or more than two notes, and they had less variation in pitch, the study found. “Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinising effect on women’s voices,” the authors said. Pisanski added: “One possible explanation is that this is caused by hormone changes after childbirth. “Previous research has shown that women’s voices can change with fertility, with pitch increasing around the time of ovulation each month, and decreasing following menopause. “We know that after pregnancy, there’s a sharp drop in the levels of key sex hormones, and that this could influence vocal fold dynamics and vocal control. “This effect could also be behavioural. Research has already shown that people with low-pitched voices are typically judged to be more competent, mature, and dominant, so it could be that women are modulating their own voices to sound more authoritative, faced with the new challenges of parenting.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25b7670937aebb29bf8c106288d6207a64e913c2/92_76_2129_1277/master/2129.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39dea7f3315618fc104fbca42020742b","title":"where has it gone wrong for england pakistan test","story":"A thumping defeat at Lord’s by Pakistan in mid-May has set alarm bells ringing and raised concerns about the methodologyEngland started the summer with the medium-term aim of synchronising their Test performances at home and away.

The retrospective rankings show the last time England were as low as No\u0026nbsp7 was, symbolically enough, December 1999.

There is plenty to love about Dom Bess, not least those infectious, eccentric interviews, but in the short term Moeen offers more in every currency. If England restore order this summer, the relatively easy winter tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies would enable them to open one eye to the future. They could also do away with the antiquated notion of a best XI. Rotation is the future, so why not make it the present? It would allow them to subtly flit between Woakes and Wood, Moeen and Bess, today and tomorrow. And by destigmatising the idea of a player being dropped, they would have scope to occasionally omit the core players who have become a bit too\u0026nbspcomfortable.It is surely no coincidence that all five of Jonny Bairstow’s Test hundreds have come in the first innings of the match – in other words, before he has kept wicket. England’s acceptance of Bairstow’s wish to stay as a keeper-batsman is weakening the team, especially now that Jos Buttler is back in the side. Bairstow is one of the few players with the capacity to score Test 150s, and you suspect he has not fully twigged how good he could be as a specialist batsman. He has such pride in his improved wicketkeeping that you can understand why he is so aggressively reluctant to give it up, and the potential effect on his morale means it is not a straightforward matter. Nor would it be an easy conversation, but England need to have it sooner rather than later: Bairstow’s pride has become a symbol of a dressing\u0026nbsproom in which too many players seem to get their own way.The Lord’s Test played out exactly as expected – except England and Pakistan swapped roles. Pakistan played with patience and discipline England were the loose cannons, as they have been for the past few years. At this rate Pakistan may have to give up ownership of the word mercurial. For the rest of the summer England should probably play a bit more like England, especially with the bat. They are like the dog that keeps soiling the same rug, and have become symbols of a culture of instant gratification. They should be smarter in their shot selection, and maybe take a lesson from their own past. In the year 2037, a young cricket geek will look at the scorecard from the Oval Test of 2017 and see a typical Ben Stokes innings: 112 from 153 balls, with nine fours and nine sixes. In fact it was a masterpiece of what we are now contractually obliged to describe as game management: he made 22 from 51 balls in extremely tough conditions, then 57 from the next 84 as things got easier. Finally, when he was left with the tail, he exploded to hit 33 from the last 18 deliveries. In one knock Stokes played a Test match innings, a one-day innings and a Twenty20 innings. All of the England batsmen should have it on their laptops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c111536a48b53b507865c4e15e62c541ad154b/0_99_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14bf7f7bdcfe43c805a7ed03b37748e4","title":"french open 2018 day four halep djokovic zverev and norrie live","story":"What an intriguing afternoon it’s turning out to be. On Philippe-Chatrier, Benoit Paire is serving to make it 1-1 in sets against Kei Nishikori. Elsewhere Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov are locked in awkward battles. As for David Goffin, the eighth seed has fought back in the first set against Corentin Moutet, but the French teenager could yet snatch it.Yulia Putintseva, who sent Jo Konta on her way the other day, has taken the first set off Jennifer Brady on Court 5. That first set was closer than the one taking place on Court 7, though. Sam Querrey, the 12th seed, is leading 4-0 against Gilles Simon, who isn’t doing much to entertain the home crowd.Dusan Lajovic led 6-2, 3-1. But now Alexander Zverev’s roaring. He pummels a backhand down the line and Lajovic, who’s looking rather underwhelmed, faffs a forehand into the net on set point. Zverev takes the second set 7-5 and he’ll feel he’s got the worst out of the way now.Grigor Dimitrov has won the second set 6-4 against Jared Donaldson. That one’s level but Alex Zverev’s fate is still uncertain. The tension’s high as the end of the second set approaches on Court 1. Kei Nishikori, a lovely player but one who’s had so many injury problems in the past year or so, is a set up against the frustrating Benoit Paire. The 19th seed took it 6-3. At least it’s looking good for France on Suzanne-Lenglen, with Corentin Moutet sparkling against David Goffin. The 19-year-old leads the eighth seed 4-1 in the first set.Madison Keys beats Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 6-1. The American, seeded 13th, faces Naomi Osaka next. That promises to be an explosive encounter.The big guns are showing signs of asserting themselves. Kei Nishikori has broken Benoit Paire for a 4-3 lead in the first set on Philippe-Chatrier, Grigor Dimitrov leads Jared Donaldson 4-2 in the second set on Court 18 and a dismal drop shot from Dusan Lajovic has allowed Alex Zverev to break back in the second set on Court 1.Dusan Lajovic has a gorgeous backhand and he’s using it to torture Alexander Zverev, who’s looking increasingly miffed. Elsewhere Madison Keys leads by 6-4, 4-1 against Caroline Dolehide.Alexander Zverev chucks to his racquet to the ground, his temper getting the better of him as he watches a backhand sail long. This is dreadful from the second seed but it’s outstanding from the wily Dusan Lajovic, who breaks again to lead 6-2, 2-1 on Court 1.It could be an afternoon of surprises. Alex Zverev is a set down and now Jared Donaldson has bloodied Grigor Dimitrov’s nose in a first-set tie-break on Court 18, winning it 7-1.In an all-American clash on Court 7, it’s Madison Keys who’s in front. The 13th seed has won the first set 6-4 against Caroline Dolehide.Dusan Lajovic gets there in the end. The first set is his, 6-2, and Alex Zverev is in a spot of bother. He could really do without another early exit from a grand slam.A shock’s brewing on Court 1. Dusan Lajovic, the unseeded Serbian, is serving for the first set at 5-2 against Alex Zverev, the second seed. Lajovic has just double-faulted on a break point, though.Over to Court 18, where Jared Donaldson has blown the opportunity to take the first set off Grigor Dimitrov. They’re into a tie-break. Novak Djokovic puts his baseball cap back on and gets down to the business of serving for the match. It doesn’t take him long. He carves out two match points and nails the first with a backhand down the line to reach the third round. Djokovic wasn’t at his most dynamic but it’s another win, he’s smiling and he might be playing himself into some form.Tomas Berdych’s revival was shortlived. The 17th seed is out, beaten 7-6, 7-6, 1-6, 5-7, 6-3 by Jeremy Chardy, who’s given the locals at Roland Garros something to cheer with a virtuoso display in the fifth set.Soup followed by an apple. Hello again. I’m back in time to tell you that Jared Donaldson is about to serve for the first set against Grigor Dimitrov and that Dusan Lajovic is up an early break against Alex Zverev.Good news! Jacob is back from his sandwich and a potential sundry. For more on that, here is the man himself.Must be great to pick and choose when to be at your best Djokovic frees his feet up and gets across the court to take the first two points before completing the victory with some bold hitting from the baseline. He thought he had broken but the umpire has overruled it, saying the Serb’s shot was out. Munar then fails to convert a volley, sending it into the net to give the break to Djokovic. Chardy held his serve and is one game away from the next round now.Djokovic has little trouble to make it level as Munar does not win a point in the latest game. Munar is still giving it his all and a spinning volley sets him on his way. He takes it to 3:2 thanks to a full array of shots, resulting in some light applause from Djokovic.Elsewhere, Chardy breaks Berdych to make it 4:2 to the Frenchman.Not to be outdone by his less-illustrious opponent, Djokovic dominates on his own serve. Winning after saving a point which looked to be going away from him by sprinting to lift a dying ball back over the net, confusing Munar who smashed a volley well wide.Munar takes the game to love to make it 2:1 in the set. Djokovic barely made contact with the new balls in that one.Chardy versus Berdych is probably more interesting at this stage with the Frenchman leading 3:2 in the deciding set. All going with serve so far.Now Djokovic is cutting a frustrated figure, as Munar ups it once again to power through the game, almost winning it. The Spaniard was really annoyed at himself for hitting one long at break-point. At the second time of asking Djokovic grinds out the win over deuce to make it 1-1 in the set.Djokovic’s body language does not reflect a man who is about to progress at Roland Garros. He seems to be going through the moments of being at a Grand Slam. Munar might be 155 in the world but he is making Djokovic work for every point. One would forgive Munar for tiring at this stage but he battles through to take the opening game of the third set with some very clean shots.Chardy versus Berdych is set to go to a decider after the latter made it two sets all. Could be a lively one there.Turns out there was a way back for Munar as the Spaniard ran into a 30:0 lead. However, Djokovic reacted by recovering to 30:30. With the scores level there was as superb rally which almost resulted in Munar playing the shot of the tournament but it was just wide. He made up for it with a stunning backhand shot down the line to take the game to deuce, though. Sadly for Munar, it was not enough, as Djokovic took the set with a couple of ruthless points. Djokovic has turned it on here to power through this game and break Munar. The Serb really was in charge of this game from start to finish and is now in control of the set thanks to this break. Djokovic looked a little bit more powerful in this one, making Munar work hard to even get over the net. Is there any way back for Munar from this?Some lovely rallying in this game - the best of the match as Djokovic took a 30-0 lead. Munar showed some great defence at the baseline but was not able to get the better of his opponent. Djokovic took the game in the end thanks to a lovely serve for the final point.Will it be Pret or Waitrose for Jacob? More on that when he returns. For now, you have my fine company to see if Djokovic can win the second set. I’m off for lunch. Will Unwin will be your guide while I head off in search of a sandwich.Off to Phillipe-Chatrier, where Tomas Berdych is slowly getting a grip on things in the fourth set against Jeremy Chardy. The 17th seed has the break. Jaume Munar is determined to enjoy himself out there, holding to lead 3-2 in the second set on Suzanne-Lenglen. Novak Djokovic needs to refocus quickly.Every time you think Jaume Munar’s down, he punches back. He breaks straight back to make it 2-2 and give Djokovic, who’s not at his best, something to think about in this second set.Djokovic breaks to love to lead 7-6, 2-1. This one might turn into an exhibition. Mind you, losing tie-breaks isn’t always fatal. Look at Tomas Berdych. He lost two last night but he’s just won the third set against Jeremy Chardy, who leads 7-6, 7-6, 1-6 on Philippe-Chatrier.It’s a ruthless tie-break from Djokovic, who only allows Jaume Munar one point. The Spaniard prods a backhand return long and he’ll do well to maintain his high level from here.Jaume Munar holds. Can he shock Djokovic?A couple of holds and Jaume Munar will serve to force a tie-break. Djokovic will be eyeing a break. On Court 3, meanwhile, 13th seed Roberto Bautista Agut has taken the first set 6-4 against Santiago Giraldo.Marco Trungelliti can start filling the car up. The Argentinian has been sent on his way by Marco Cechinnato, who’s beaten the lucky loser 6-1, 7-6, 6-1. What must Bernard Tomic be thinking?Serving for the first set, Novak Djokovic finds himself facing three break points. He saves the first two but he pushes a shot out of bounds on the third. Jaume Munar breaks back! Djokovic leads 5-4. He won’t be happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b70af4228da49e257e27a5d00c1d5ce1cca3211/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bdb47b24910e4e80819f3a53cbd1859","title":"piers morgan richard madeley good morning britain host","story":"As an abruptly terminated interview with Gavin Williamson shows, Morgan’s Good Morning Britain summer stand-in is even more lacking in self-awareness than his predecessorOur country has been cleaved in two. Unable to reconcile their differences over this insurmountable matter, friendships have come to an abrupt halt and families have been permanently torn asunder. The nation is in disarray. Common ground is nowhere to be seen. And all because people can’t work out whether Piers Morgan or Richard Madeley is the more spectacularly weird Good Morning Britain host.Sure, on the surface, Piers Morgan runs away with it. Ever since he debuted in 2015, Morgan has essentially treated the programme the same way your deaf grandfather treats an Amazon Echo, bellowing an impenetrable barrage of opinion and abuse at the top of his voice regardless of anything else that happens to be going on. Piers Morgan’s gone-to-seed Joffrey shtick is now so pronounced that his colleagues openly make hay with it, tweeting pictures of their own distant faraway stares whenever he so much as opens his mouth. For a while, he looked unbeatable.But now a contender has arrived, and he is glorious. Since first being brought aboard as Morgan’s holiday cover in the middle of last year, Richard Madeley has quietly carved out a niche of his own. Madeley isn’t as combative as Morgan, but what he lacks in aggression he also lacks in self-awareness. A one-man Accidental Partridge generator, Madeley is fast developing into Good Morning Britain’s real star. In his first week, he overcooked a link about quicksand and veered off into confusing tangents about Gaby Roslin. In March, he commented lustily on a weather presenter’s dress immediately before crashing into a segment about the #MeToo movement.And on Tuesday – and this might be what ultimately clinches his victory – Madeley prematurely ended an interview with Gavin Williamson live on air. Peeved that the defence secretary wouldn’t answer a question on some recent language about Russia, Madeley began to scrawl furiously on his script. “You’re not gonna answer, are you? OK, alright, OK, interview terminated then”, he barked like a stroppy teenager, while an African elephant aimlessly stumbled around behind Williamson’s back.It was all there. Drama, showmanship and, most of all, the sense that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Over the years, Madeley has essentially become a concentrated version of himself. You sense that all the golden moments of old – the Ali G impersonation, the time he shook his fist at his daughter’s mugger on live TV – have been inexorably leading to a moment like this. Whenever he appears on camera, Madeley gets to ride roughshod over Good Morning Britain. It’s a place where he’s allowed to indulge all of his whims and digressions, no matter how batty or grumpy they happen to be. If Madeley is suddenly gripped by an idea – and he often is – Good Morning Britain is now the place where it can rise up and consume him. Make no mistake, Morgan created this environment. Thanks to him, Good Morning Britain’s dynamic is now one where the male hosts get to bulldoze whatever boorish path they like and the – much more traditionally competent – female hosts good-naturedly roll their eyes at the damage. When Morgan goes away, Madeley fills this vacuum perfectly.The problem is that Madeley is better at this than Morgan. The latter is hamstrung by his need to constantly be seen as a capital-J journalist a man forged in the fires of tabloid publishing, doggedly seeking out the truth no matter how unappealing it makes him look. But Madeley’s training ground was daytime television, so he’s softer and more camera-ready. Where Morgan looks angry, Madeley just looks clueless, and cluelessness is much more palatable first thing in the morning.This might be premature, but it feels as if the competition is over. The Piers Morgan experiment was a noble one, but Richard Madeley is the T-1000 to his T-800. He’s slicker and harder to resist. Instead of punching you to death, Richard Madeley will creep into your room and shove a spike through your face. At this point, Good Morning Britain is his for the taking. Unless Good Morning Britain does something radical and hires someone more suited to the job. Someone like, I don’t know, a tomato on a stick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583528d9c60699838a9c4f0ab42291dd94b4718c/0_12_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f191ad77e02b3cf10993ea13b2d178","title":"head of italys m5s rekindles negotiations to form a government","story":"A bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone had ided populist partiesThe head of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has rekindled negotiations to form a government, days after a bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone ended a fledgling deal for populist parties to take power.Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of M5S, Italy’s largest party, indicated on Wednesday he was prepared to compromise on his controversial choice of a eurosceptic economist, Paolo Savona, for finance minister. But he insisted that his pick for prime minister remained political newcomer Giuseppe Conte. In the absence of an agreement between Di Maio , the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and the far right leader Matteo Salvini, Di Maio said he favoured snap elections.“There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said.Italian markets, which have been hit hard by the political crisis, rallied on the news of a potential new deal, which would at least temporarily put plans for a new election on hold. While markets have also been worried about the prospect of a populist government taking over the eurozone’s third-largest economy, the new government that would be formed between an alliance of the M5S and the far-right League would have a relatively narrow majority in the Italian Senate, limiting their ability to take any dramatic action.But the promise of a new government was hit by complications almost as soon as it was floated. Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic head of the League, who has proposed plans to detain and deport hundreds of thousand of migrants as part of his election campaign, indicated he still favoured snap elections.The latest development was another twist in a complicated tangle of news as the parties have tried and failed, several times, to reach a power-sharing deal.The M5S and the League are Italy’s biggest populist parties, but differ significantly on policy. An agreement reached earlier this month for a shared agenda was focused on plans to increase spending, slash taxes, and take a far tougher approach on migration than the previous centre-left government, including the creation of new detention centres across Italy.Di Maio and Salvini reached a deal to nominate Conte to serve as prime minister last week, even though the law professor has no political experience. Mattarella agreed on the choice, despite questions over whether he had padded out his CV. But the president on Sunday night vetoed the populists’ choice of Savona as finance minister, saying the nomination would send a message to markets and investors that Italy was prepared to default on its obligations to Brussels and might even contemplate an exit from the eurozone. Leaving the euro, Mattarella said, posed a risk to all Italians and their financial security.It was a controversial move, with both Di Maio and Salvini arguing that Mattarella had overstepped his constitutional authority and made a political decision, even though he is meant to be apolitical. However presidents have the constitutional authority to block such nominations, and have done so in the past.On Monday, Mattarella nominated a former official at the International Monetary Fund, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as interim prime minister. Italian markets were in free fall on Monday and Tuesday, amid heightened fears that new elections were imminent, and that anti-euro parties were poised to make gains in the next poll. The market reaction is one factor that likely forced Di Maio back to the negotiating table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff84c48828989deba9b73d38b8209eaa292b5100/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc773ca56f07929c68725954efe29df","title":"karachi residents cool off pakistan heatwave in pictures","story":"Pakistan’s most populous city is in the grips of a heatwave as temperatures soar to 45C.

Photo: iStockEducation authorities insist a major overhaul of the special needs assistant (SNA) scheme in schools will improve outcomes for young people and is not a cover for cost-cutting.Almost 35,000 students with additional care needs - such as autism - are currently supported by more than 14,000 special needs assistants to attend school each day.The Department of Public Expenditure has previously expressed concern over “rapidly escalating”costs which have jumped by more than third in the past five years to half a billion euro.A review of the scheme by the National Council for Special Education has found that, while it works well for some pupils, “radical changes” are needed to improve outcomes for students.This involves broadening the current role of SNAs - which are confined to care needs such as toileting, mobility and feeding - to help assist with the delivery of speech and language or occupational therapy, and with meeting children’s emotional and social needs.On foot of this, the council recommends raising the qualifications required to become a SNA, better training and greater access to speech and language and other therapies within schools.Minister for Education Richard Bruton welcomed the report and said it was clear the State’s existing response to meeting the needs of students with additional care needs should be broadened to offer a more comprehensive and tailored response.“My Department will now begin to develop proposals to implement the recommendations of the comprehensive review of the SNA scheme,” he said.* Re-naming SNAs as “inclusion support assistants”, to reflect their focus on developing student’s independence* Boosting access to a greater range of supports, and making expertise available in regional teams to support schools. This will include 10 regional teams with 230 specialist teachers, therapists, special educational needs organisers and behavioural practitioners who will work directly with schools and students* Provision of in-school therapy* Training and upskilling for SNAs as well as teachers and the wider school communityThe council has estimated that the changes would cost an additional €40 million a year, and says they should be phased in over a number of years.Teresa Griffin, the council’s chief executive, said thousands of SNAs have worked extremely hard to meet the needs of students with additional care needs.“However, the reality is that, to get the best outcomes, students need the right support from the right person at the right time,” she said.“Students may need speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, nursing supports and people who are trained to help them manage challenging behaviours. They may need access to SNAs who are trained to meet their additional care needs.”The proposed changes follow an 18-month review of the scheme, along with consultation with schools, parents, policy-makers and students.The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals said the council’s proposals were a “ huge leap forward” by recognising the wide range of supports required by students.However, the group’s director Clive Byrne said funding must be prioritised and ring-fenced."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513041.1527621230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit aids surge in irish passport applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Foreign Affairs has appealed to people to renew passports online.The UK’s exit from the European Union next year has “undoubtedly” contributed to a 25 per cent spike in applications for Irish passports, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said.The number of applications in the first four months of this year has increased by 25 per cent when compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.The department said the Passport Office, which falls under its remit, was currently experiencing “peak season”, adding that the number of applications received is up by 10 per cent compared with last year, continuing a recent trend.Each year, the Passport Office recruits additional temporary staff to assist with the seasonal increase in applications. This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Alan BetsonMinister for Transport Shane Ross is set to propose a ban on the use of rickshaws.Mr Ross is to outline his intentions at an Oireachtas committee meeting on Wednesday.In his opening remarks, the Minister will confirm he has been debating the regulation of the vehicles or an outright ban and will say that the status quo is not an option.On the issue of regulation, he says new laws would be required to allow for driver and operator licensing, vehicle registration and licensing, rickshaw roadworthiness (involving an NCT-style test), motor tax, fares regulation, regulation in the standards of service, and offences and penalties to allow for proper enforcement.“Rickshaws are arguably meeting a certain niche demand which is not being met by the traditional public transport services . . . Regulating could allow rickshaws to continue in operation, contributing a fun and vibrant aspect to city life,” he will say.Prohibition would be a significant step in managing the risk for public safety, Mr Ross will say.“New legislation would be needed, but enforcement of a ban should cost significantly less than implementing a full new regulatory regime. We would still have to define the rickshaw as a vehicle in law, and provide for detention powers. But this would involve a much simpler piece of legislation.”The Minister’s officials are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to consider any blockages which might arise with the preferred approach of prohibition, including how best to weigh and balance private interests in the context of the public good.“Once consultations with the Office of the Attorney General are complete, I expect to be in a position to finalise and announce my decision before the end of this Dáil term,” he will say.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"day 1942 1000 raf bombers obliterate cologne major escalation","story":"Official government art depicting the bombing of CologneOn the evening of 30 May 1942, over 1,000 bombers took off for Cologne as part of a dramatic new strategy by Arthur Harris, the recently appointed head of Bomber Command.That year, Bomber Command typically had around 400 aircraft on a given day, so Harris called in favours.

now, for the first time, prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, it found.Some 35.8 million gallons of sparkling wine were sold during the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A five per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give prosecco and champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Crémant vs crémant - the new fizz warsWine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity are French crémant sparkling wines, which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.The Split, episode 6 recap: one last hurrah for Hannah and her sisters?Russia denies involvement in murder of journalist and Kremlin critic Arkady BabchenkoStrictly Come Dancing reveal new professionals dancers for 2018 line-upMurder arrests after aspiring actress falls to her death from 19th floor of London skyscraperMajor security breach as man evades police to scale roof of ParliamentEDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookBritish Putin critic Bill Browder released after arrest in Spain because Russian Interpol warrant had expiredBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Dalaman airport in TurkeyDartford bus crash sees 14 injured after ploughing into dozens of vehicles Royal wedding row over grass cutting as councillors accused of prioritising Meghan\u0026#39s hotelFrench police clear out Paris migrant campThe world\u0026#39s longest flight is launching in October (but there\u0026#39s a major catch)Ryanair quietly increases charge to travel with your carry-on bagMinister urges consumers to boycott ticketing website Viagogo Anti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Magician David Copperfield not liable for Briton\u0026#39s injuries during trick as jury finds tourist was 100pc responsibleLobster, champagne and chips: how shopping habits really compare between rich and poorActive Shooter school massacre video game branded ‘disgusting’ and ‘horrific’ by Parkland victim parentsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164866705_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"regular meetings ruin productivity workers worry running late","story":"Staff anticipating a meeting mentally subtract the time they have availableRegular meetings ruin productivity because workers are constantly worried about running late, a study has found.Staff anticipating a meeting - or people expecting a friend for dinner - mentally subtract up to 30 per cent of the time they have available.Scientists found that having created an unnecessary buffer “in case something comes up”, people perform fewer tasks, or smaller tasks, than if their next appointment was not looming over them.Researchers at Ohio state University’s Fisher College of Business asked participants how long they could spend reading an hour before an appointment for which they were fully prepared.  Respondents said they had 50 minutes available, and even said that subjectively it felt like they had only 40 minutes..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}You don’t feel like you can get as much done when you have a task coming up soon.

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more

"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands flat doors replaced grenfell borough ones can withstand","story":"A fireman who rescued nine people from Grenfell Tower has said that criticism of his colleagues is unfair as they “risked their own lives to save others”. Survivors have said that the brigade\u0027s \u0027stay put\u0027 advice to residents, which remained for almost two hours after the first emergency call despite flames engulfing the building, contributed to the loss of 72 lives as a result of the fire. The public inquiry has this week heard anger from families about why their loved ones were not rescued, but  Aldo Diana, 55, has said that those on the scene worked as hard as they could and put their own lives in danger to help others. Mr Diana, who managed a crew of four on the night, said that it was the biggest blaze he had ever seen in his 26 years as a firefighter and it didn\u0027t seem real.  When asked whether the criticism that it was not the finest hour for London Fire Brigade was fair, Mr Diana said that he would have liked to take inside with him the people who thought that. I think that the London Fire Brigade from Danny Cotton, the commissioner, all the way down to some of the new guys who have just joined, I think everybody worked damn hard that night, he said. Firefighters like myself and many other firefighters that night went into the building and risked their own lives to save others.Grenfell Tower fire in picturesMr Diana, who rescued nine people and carried one survivor down at least 13 floors, added: We did what we could that night, the fire service and everybody else worked as hard as they could that night. Some of the guys I went in twice on that night and I know guys who went in three times.When you are trying to wear a breathing apparatus set, full gear, you\u0027re drained from the first. I went up and down those stairs six times. Up and down half way up that building six times.His comments come a day after Paulos Tekle, whose 5-year-old son Isaac Paulos died as they tried to escape, told the public inquiry that if he had not listened to the fire brigade my son would likely be alive today. Mr Diana  said that he was one of the later crews to arrive, after 2am, and therefore did not know anything about the \u0027stay put\u0027 policy. I was there as a firefighter to save life, so I can\u0027t answer that stay put advice, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today.He said that he also could not answer whether the advice needed to change in other tower block fires, but noted that in his experience: Fires don\u0027t spread the way that that did.  This fire was totally different to anything that I have been in, fire\u0027s don\u0027t spread the way that this one did, normally they are contained in the one room or the one flat that they start in they may go to a flat one above or one flat to the left or right, he said. But never in the 26 years I have been in has a fire jumped or gone round the building such as this one did. So people are generally, 99pc of the time, safe.It was announced on Wednesday that around round 4,000 doors on homes in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where the fire took place, are set to be replaced with ones which are fire-resistant for 30 minutes, the time stipulated in the current Building Regulation standards.In March, it was revealed that an undamaged door from the Grenfell tower block was tested and found it could only withstand a blaze for 15 minutes - not the 30 for which it was designed.Plans for the £3.5 million project will be discussed next week. The authority said the doors it would be replacing are not necessarily deficient in terms of fire risk assessments.It added: This is not currently a legislative requirement, but this may change following the completion of the current building regulations review.Meanwhile, a report has found that voluntary organisations filled the void left by a lack of official direction in the wake of the disaster. The report, Mind The Gap: A Review Of The Voluntary Sector Response To The Grenfell Tragedy, found that many voluntary organisations stepped up to the challenge of meeting the needs of the community where the statutory authorities fell short, particularly in the early stages.Please review our commenting policyThe Split, episode 6 recap: one last hurrah for Hannah and her sisters?Russia denies involvement in murder of journalist and Kremlin critic Arkady BabchenkoStrictly Come Dancing reveal new professionals dancers for 2018 line-upMurder arrests after aspiring actress falls to her death from 19th floor of London skyscraperMajor security breach as man evades police to scale roof of ParliamentEDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookBritish Putin critic Bill Browder released after arrest in Spain because Russian Interpol warrant had expiredBritish passenger dies after falling from plane at Dalaman airport in TurkeyDartford bus crash sees 14 injured after ploughing into dozens of vehicles Royal wedding row over grass cutting as councillors accused of prioritising Meghan\u0026#39s hotelFrench police clear out Paris migrant campThe world\u0026#39s longest flight is launching in October (but there\u0026#39s a major catch)Ryanair quietly increases charge to travel with your carry-on bagMinister urges consumers to boycott ticketing website Viagogo Anti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Magician David Copperfield not liable for Briton\u0026#39s injuries during trick as jury finds tourist was 100pc responsibleLobster, champagne and chips: how shopping habits really compare between rich and poorActive Shooter school massacre video game branded ‘disgusting’ and ‘horrific’ by Parkland victim parentsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/10/15/maccari-cicero.jpg","title":"shipwrecks uk hms victoria voc hollandia anniversary","story":"Tragedies that befell sailors decades or even centuries ago still fascinate and move us, showing,\u0026nbspGodfrey Holmes\u0026nbspsays, the enduring power of the oceans over our imaginationTwo ships, two missions, two follies, two groundings, two sinkings and two frightful disasters. One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But it’s the European Union that protects more than ever our sovereignty in a globalised world,” Mr Bettel said in his address to the parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg.“The European Union provides added value to European citizens, in countless instances improving their daily lives. However, one of the greatest challenges the union faces today is the fact that these advantages resulting from a country’s membership of the union are simply taken for granted.EU budget chief accused of \u0027bullying\u0027 Italian voters over populistsMay tells EU to stop sound-bites despite coining \u0027Brexit means Brexit\u0027UK must \u0027come fully out\u0027 of EU customs union, Boris Johnson saysEU officials tear into UK’s ‘fantasy’ Brexit negotiating strategyUK ‘strongly objects’ to being excluded from EU’s Galileo satellite“It is therefore not a coincidence that so many UK citizens living in my country have been applying for Luxembourg citizenship since the Brexit referendum. Many others are apparently doing the same in other member states.“These applications for citizenship by British citizens are proof of the huge added value of the public goods and services created by the European Union which these citizens don’t want to abandon: most obviously the four freedoms.”Mr Bettel said the EU did not “want to punish Britain” but that the country could not have “the advantages without the constraints”. “We must have common rules and we must say to UK you can\u0027t have one without the other.”But the country’s PM warned against turning on voters themselves, adding: “Brexit is really a blow for all of us and same goes to Italy.

Mr Sheleg is an Israeli-born businessman who reportedly could soon become the party\u0027s new treasurer.

In 2004 he was appointed chairman of a state-owned bank by presidential decree and awarded an Order of Honour from Mr Putin in 2004.However, he was then dismissed from the role for for his loyalty to Mikhail Kasyanov, a vocal critic of Mr. Putin, and moved to the UK with his family some time later.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Anthony and Carole BamfordCameron\u0027s dinner guests: CEO of CQS Michael Hintze (pictured) and his wife Dorothy.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Chief Executive of  Media Group, Murdoch MacLennan and his wife Elsa.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Lord John Sainsbury (pictured), President of J Sainsbury supermaket, and his wife Lady Sainsbury.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests:  property developer and David RowlandCameron\u0027s dinner guests: chief executive of ICAP plc, Michael Spencer (pictured) and his wife.In 2012, the Electoral Commission declared Ms Chernukhin an “impermissible donor” before the regulatory body subsequently allowed her to donate £626,500 over the next six years.As Mr Johnson told Andrew Marr earlier this year, Ms Chernukhin is a British citizen has every right to exercise her democratic rights and donate to a political party.When Mr Marr cited fears that the Conservative Party have been taking far too much Russian money, Mr Johnson said: If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way the gentleman obtained his wealth .. then it is possible for our law enforcement to deprive him of his wealth.Chris Bryant, Labour MP and vice-chairman of Parliament’s all-party group on Russia, said at the time: “The Prime Minister said quite categorically this week that we should be tackling Putin’s cronies. What could be more of a crony that Putin’s former deputy finance minister?”A Conservative Party spokesman said: All donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The verdict means the Coxes cannot seek monetary damages, court spokeswoman Mary Ann Price said. Gavin Cox testified that he suffered brain and other injuries in a fall while stagehands urged him and others to run during an illusion that appeared to make as many as 13 audience volunteers disappear onstage and reappear moments later, waving flashlights in the back of the theatre. His lawyer, Benedict Morelli, told jurors during closing arguments that the trick was inherently dangerous, and that Copperfield should be held partially liable for Cox\u0027s injuries. Four years ago, attorneys estimated that Cox had that racked up more than $400,000 in medical costs. Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost a bid to close the courtroom to the public to prevent disclosure of secrets about the illusion. At least 55,000 audience volunteers had taken part in the trick over 17 years, according to Copperfield and show executive producer Chris Kenner. Jurors learned that in about 60 to 90 seconds, stagehands with flashlights ushered the randomly chosen participants past dark curtains, down passageways, around corners, outdoors, indoors and through an MGM Grand resort kitchen to re-enter the theatre for the show\u0027s finale, according to testimony. I was having a good time up until the time I was injured, Cox testified. He recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust. Cox, 57, a former chef from Kent, England, said he fell hard on his right side and didn\u0027t remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats what I want to do now.Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK.Euthanasia, sometimes known as mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending someones life to relieve their pain and suffering, while assisted suicide involves the person wishing to die taking an active role in ending their own life.Euthanasia carries a maximum penalty of life in jail, and assisted suicide 14 years.The only exception is passive euthanasia, which is where treatment that might extend someones life is withdrawn - such as a life machine being turned off.The only alternatives for terminally ill patients in the UK are hospice care or refusing treatment, which mentally capable patients have the right to do.As a result, some terminally ill people decide to travel abroad to die.She said she had always known her fathers wishes, and was not surprised at his request.It took seven months of planning to take her elderly father overseas, with the help of son Scott, and Susan said she felt that the clinic was professional and caring.Son Scott added: Its not pleasant to see your loved one die, obviously.It was a sense of relief for him.He was suffering and not facing a quality of life.The family said they were not worried about facing charges over Mr Lentons decision.Sandra said: I am prepared for that, because it was the right thing for my father.It has to be an individuals choice.But she hit back at suggestions that allowing people to be taken to suicide clinics would open the door to abuse.Sandra said: People are very clear about whether they want to do this or not.You cant pressure someone into this. Its entirely them right through the process."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000077236400.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mh370 mystery disappearance malaysia airlines flight latest","story":"As a group of aviation experts have revealed what they believe really happened to the Malaysia Airlines plane, we give you details on other arguments...Flight 370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board.Just 38 minutes into the flight, MH370 lost contact with Malaysia Airlines.The first official £112.5million search launched by Australia, China and Malaysia ended in January 2017.But early 2018, Malaysia agreed to pay US firm Ocean Infinity up to £51.53million ($70million) if it found the plane within 90 days.The company have now launched one last-ditch search trip to find the missing planes black box.Theyll be sending a ship to the remote spot in the Indian Ocean where an ultrasonic pulse - which may have been from the planes black box - was detected in 2014.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH370.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large life insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH370 could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a 15-inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH370 disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had 220 passengers on board, on March 5, 2014.Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and diverted into the communist nation.A group of aviation experts assembled for the Australian TV programme 60 Minutes.They claimed they may have solved the aviation mystery.They all agreed that Shah deliberately ditched the plane in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.Former Australia Transport Safety Bureau head Martin Dolan added: This was planned, this was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of time.Simon Hardy, a pilot and instructor, discovered the captain made an unexplained and strange turn to fly over his hometown of Penang.He also claimed Shah dodged Malaysian and Thai military radar by skirting along their borders.But aviation expert has rubbished claims made in the documentary that the pilot of doomed flight MH370 gently landed the plane in the Indian ocean.Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing 777s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March 2014, meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.He added that a second referendum would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.Mr Soros continued: The British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe.The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in.But he added that if the EU is serious about overturning Brexit, it should reform to become more flexible.Mr Soros demanded a multi-track Europe that recognises different countries want different levels of integration.Brexit backers today hit out at his comments and said a second referendum would defy the will of the British people.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said: George Soros wants to overturn the largest democratic mandate in British electoral history, but in the same breath admits the EU is in an ‘existential crisis’ and needs to change to convince the UK to rejoin.A second referendum would not only damage our negotiating position, but would also send a dangerous signal that Parliament is seeking to ignore the votes of 17.4million people.Mr Soros, a Hungarian-American who is the worlds richest hedge fund manager, has spent millions on political causes around the world.He has been accused of using his cash to defy democracy - but insists he is only trying to promote freedom and stability.After receiving his donation, Best for Britain has launched a national poster campaign and is lobbying MPs directly to support a re-run of the 2016 vote."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004095677631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"crooks carling beer selfies community service","story":"The trio stopped their gardening task at a ­nursing home to nip to Tesco before having a lager in a snap captioned “Might aswell av a few on unpaid work”.In another Lee Snowden and Matthew Fisher, both 30, give the finger to the camera, while pal Chris Bader writes: “Always taking selfies.”A third photo shows a man with his back to the camera and the words: “Want ur rooms decorating by 7 criminals cheap labour just hide your valuables.”The photos, in which the men have on hi-vis “Community Payback” vests, were taken in ­Bingley, West Yorks, and posted on Facebook.The trio were shopped by a member of the public who saw the pictures online.The men may have to return to court to be re-sentenced for breaching the terms of their community service, during which drinking is banned.

He will find out that it’s not that easy.”But it can also be revealed that Home Office bosses do fear 51 year-old Abramovich “buying” an EU passport from Russia-friendly states such as Cyprus and Malta.It is very difficult to exclude anyone with EU citizenship from coming into the UK.The source added: “If Abramovich bought an EU passport from somewhere like Cyprus, it would be very difficult to keep him out.“It would then be up to the EU to explain what they have done.”Downing Street also said that Israel’s visa waiver scheme would not give anyone the longterm right to work in the UK.The scheme only gives the likes of Abramovich half a year maximum here for leisure or business trips.His £8.6billion oil fortune means he has overtaken Israeli shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer, worth £6.85billion.Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and issues a passport. Roman will also be exempt from paying tax for ten years, sources said.A No10 spokesman said: “Those with Israeli passports are non-visa nationals, which means they do not need a visa to come to the UK as a visitor for a maximum period of six months.“Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK.”In a significantly tightening of the rules since the Salisbury nerve agent attack, it is believed the Home Office have demanded Mr Abramovich spell out precisely how he came about his £9bn fortune before his visa is renewed.The bureaucratic questions will take many months, in a retaliatory move designed to heap pressure on Mr Putin.Boris Johnson revealed the Government’s thinking during a hoax call with pranksters pretending to be the Armenian PM last week.The Foreign Secretary said: “I think it is very important for the Russians to know that the UK is absolutely determined to stand firm against them and we will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs that surround Putin.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever is holding one when the music stops gets called up on stage.The Lucky 13 are then suspended in a cage and given torches to shine back at the audience before being hidden from view with a cover and taken off the stage through a secret passageway.They are then told to run down backstage corridors to reappear in the back of the theatre clutching the torches they were given by Copperfield during the trick.But Mr Cox claims he slipped and fell 22ft from the door that lead back into the theatre, injuring his neck and brain.He testified: I was having a good time up until the time I was injured.Mr Cox recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust.He said he fell hard on his right side and didnt remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013.Afterwards, Mr Cox said he received medical treatment from paramedics and at a hospital for shoulder and other injuries.Two day later, he and his wife and a lawyer returned to the theatre at the MGM Grand and filed an accident report.Copperfield testified that until Mr Cox sued in August 2014, he never knew of anyone getting hurt during nearly 20 years performing the illusion on tour and in Las Vegas.He said he stopped performing it a year later.The magician said he didnt see construction dust on the ground when he passed through the same outdoor alley alone as part of another illusion about 10 minutes earlier.Mr Coxs lawyers brought in three women who testified that they also were injured during the illusion over the years.One included a schoolteacher who said she fell but finished with a bloody knee during a Copperfield performance about five months before Mr Coxs fall."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000253378773.jpg?w=960","title":"biggest ever invasion flying ants","story":"The pests are set to swarm across the UK in record numbers - with infestations up by 150 per cent in just two months.Experts are blaming the explosion on warmer weather in April and May after Brits basked in 29C heat.Pest controllers at Rentokil say 50billion more flying ants - 1,000 for each Brit - could sweep the UK causing grief for homeowners.A spokesman said: Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April.Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate.This happens on Flying Ant Day when swarms take to the skies and breed mid-air.The most common type of flying ant is the black garden variety (the Lasius niger), whose nests have a single queen and anything from 5,000 to 15,000 workers.Flying ants are not dangerous insects and are unlikely to bite.Even though theyre harmless, flying ants are still annoying - but fortunately, there are many household items which can be used to get rid once and for all.Spraying with dish-washing soap mixed with water can dehydrate the ants.Asparteme-based sweeter is said to be effective.Combining this with juice to form a paste means the critters will carry it back to their colony - killing off some of the ant population in the process.Distributing some insecticidal powder around window and door openings can also prevent the ants from entering your home.Rentokil also says to clean up after yourself and keep food and rubbish bags sealed tightly.The surge also means Flying Ant Day - when the creatures search for a mate - could be bumped from July to as early as June.The day marks the start of the insects mating season, when millions of the horny critters take to the skies to breed mid-air.But it lasts for much longer than a day - usually lasting for around two weeks.David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July.It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves.This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer.It comes after Brits were warned of a summer explosion of Asian hornets after reports of the striped terrors turning up in the West Country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409752963.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pope francis john bradburne saint canonisation","story":"Campaigners are calling on Pope Francis to canonise John Bradburne — who they say performed miracles in the war-torn country.The poet and aid worker wore distinctives monks robes and a Christ-like beard as he cared for lepers in what was then 1970s Rhodesia.But Mugabes Zanu-PF guerillas believed him to be an informant  for the British-backed government and captured him in 1979.Bradburne was marched and tortured — including being forced to eat dog dirt — before he was subjected to a rigged trial.He was offered the chance to leave the country but he refused, insisting that he wanted to return to care for the ill and infirm at the Mutemwa colony.Bradburne, 58, was instead gunned down as he prayed and his half-naked body was dumped by the roadside before being buried outside the capital Harare.Now, supporters hope to raise £20,000 to to pay for an inquiry into his life and the reported miracles linked to him.His niece Celia Brigstocke, 63, is leading the campaign to have Mr Bradburne beatified and then canonised.If successful, he will be the first English person to become a saint in nearly 50 years since The 40 Martyrs of England and Wales — who were executed for treason between 1535 and 1679 — were canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.John was born in Westmorland, Cumbria in 1921 as the son of an Anglican rector before converting to Catholicism in 1947.The WWII veteran, who bravely served with the Ghurkas in Singapore and Burma, took 16 years to travel the world  and explore his spiritualism.A productive writer, John wrote around 6,000 poems in his lifetime — earning him the Guinness World Record for the most prolific in the English language.He then settled in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe in 1969 where he built a church at the Mutemwa colony and devoted his life to its inhabitants.Bradburne was fiercely loyal to the lepers, even bathing their wounds, praying and sleeping alongside them despite the risk of infection.Among his supposed miracles, mourners at his funeral reported seeing drops of blood below his coffin although there was no blood inside.Supporters also say a man was cured of a brain tumour ten years ago after praying to Mr Bradburne.The Archbishop of Harare, the Most Rev Robert Ndlovu, is said to be supportive of the campaign which could ultimately see him beatified and made a saint by Pope Francis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409742564.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"incredible colour pictures reveal devastation of britains first air raids 103 years since german zeppelins bombed uk cities","story":"The bombing campaign, known as the “First Blitz”, killed 500 people on British soil during WWI.They show how peoples lives in the capital were ripped apart following the first Zeppelin attack on London in May 1915.Pictures in the fascinating collection also show the wreckage of a damaged L20 Zeppelin aircraft after it crashed into the sea off the coast of Norway.The airship was known as the “Raider of Loughborough” after being involved in the attack on the Midlands.The aircraft’s passengers can be seen rowing away from the wreckage.Other images show British soldiers desperately searching for survivors from the wreckage after a devastating raid in London.Another image shows a large sunken hole in the ground where a Zeppelin bomb tore through the ground, creating a deep well filled with rubble and debris.Military personnel and civilians are seen beside the hole as they survey the damage of yet another raid against Britain.One impressively colourised photo depicts a female munitions worker busy in a factory in 1915, before the factories became a key target for the bombing.Britain’s industrial heartlands were heavily populated, and their destruction would affect Britain’s war resources drastically.The incredible shots were colourised by British professional colouriser Tom Marshall of PhotograFix.He said: “Zeppelins were like no other weapon ever encountered before.“They were impossible to spot in the night sky, they flew higher than any British aeroplanes could reach, and were out of range of any guns.“They were the height of luxury travel before the war, but nobody imagined the death and destruction that airships could bring to Britain’s streets during World War One.”From this, the Kaiser authorised bombings on London to happen in February, however these were then postponed until April in the hopes it would be more weather permitting by this time.Once April fell, the bombing raids were delayed further until the newer and bigger P Class Zeppelins were available. This led to the first London bombings on the night of May 31, 1915.The fatal raids at the end of May in 1915 were commanded by the German officer Viktor Leopold Linnarz who ordered an LZ 38 airship to drop explosives over the capital.A total of 120 bombs were dropped from Stoke Newington to as far south as Stepney and as far north as Leytonstone.Seven people were killed and thirty-five were injured in these raids which burned down seven buildings.The damage from this one day of raids was estimated to have cost the government over £18,500, the equivalent of approximately £2 million today.The development of the Zeppelin airship was first pioneered by the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the early twentieth century, and were they first flown commercially in 1910.During the First World War, the German military made use of the power of Zeppelins by using them as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people during the numerous bombing raids against Britain.The use of Zeppelins caused death and destruction away from the trenches and allowed Germany to attack the British on their own soil.The Zeppelin raids over London on May 31 forced the British government to issue a D-notice which prohibited any UK press outlets from reporting anything about the raids which wasn’t mentioned in the official statements.In 1921 the Allied Powers requested that Germany hand over all Zeppelins in reparation for the devastation they caused during the war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004068280204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays latest suggestion to solve irish border issue dismissed by eu as very complicated before it was even presented at brexit talks","story":"The Prime Minister suggested using the so-called “back stop” solution – favoured by Brussels – after the transition period, but for a limited time only.However officials say this idea, where the UK mirrors existing EU rules, would be “very, very complicated” and fear it would only postpone the negotiations on a long-term solution.Negotiators in Brussels have said they think the backstop should be a permanent solution if it is implemented, but Mrs May has ruled it out.Instead she favours a so-called “new customs partnership” to deal with trade issues between Norther Ireland and the Republic once we exit the bloc.But that idea, along with a rival plan favoured by Brexiteers in her Cabinet like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, has already been rejected by the EU.This latest knock-back by the EU creates further doubt that progress will be made on a border solution at the next European Council summit in June.A senior official told Politico of Mrs Mays time-limited backstop idea: “It would be a very, very complicated thing to negotiate. I really dont see how you get there.”The PM has only recently secured backing from her Cabinet, senior Brexiteers and the DUP for the proposal after weeks of wrangling.From the UK side there are two long-term options being discussed, a ‘customs partnership’ and ‘maximum facilitation’.The first is the favoured model of the Prime Minister, it is a hybrid system which would see the UK collecting tariffs on imports on the EU’s behalf.Supporters say it would allow for a frictionless border but Brexiteers say it is unworkable – with Boris Johnson labelling it ‘crazy’ – and would prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after we leave.Mr Johnson prefers the other option, known as ‘max-fac’, as it would take us further outside the grasp of the EU and allow us to strike deals of our own.It would require technological advances to smooth any problem at the border, however some suggest it may breach the Good Friday Agreement.Brussels has dismissed both options as Narnia and has set out a fallback option under which the UK would maintain full alignment with enough rules of the customs union and single market to prevent a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement.Mrs May suggested this could be only be a very short-term solution, saying no Prime Minister could ever agree to such terms, as they would undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK.But an agreement does need to be found soon, as the EU have said no progress can be made on other issues like trade without an agreement on Ireland first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Me and my daughter couldnt even go to sleep last night because we were so scared.I didnt believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.The medical receptionist insists no one had been behind her son Byrin when she took the photo of him standing in front of a tree.It was only when the family got home and was looking through her snaps that she realised something appeared to be there.She said: When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin?When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like but there was nobody there!It looks like a child to me, I dont know if its a girl or a boy. But I can see this face and it looks like the hand is on my sons shoulder, which is very bizarre.She added: Some people have said I must have Photoshopped it as they cant believe it.

Im rubbish with technology and Im just not the kind of person to do that.She said her son would have noticed someone so close to him, saying: I would have seen them and I wouldnt have taken a picture with another kid behind him.Many have speculated on what the figure could be - with some suggesting it could be the spirit of a boy who drowned in the woods years ago.Laura, of Newcastle, said: I dont know much about the history of the woods but some people are saying that many moons ago a young boy drowned in the river. You dont know if its just hearsay.People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

It is perhaps facing a crisis of legitimacy - this is why we may see an escalation on the military front.Israel says the protests are being used as a \"camouflage for terror\".On Sunday it says its forces discovered an explosive device on the border fence.A Hamas position was targeted in response and three members of Islamic Jihad were killed.Israel was braced for retaliation. And it came on Tuesday morning.The fact that so many mortars were fired and that some landed in a kindergarten ramps the tension up further, which is why Israel\u0027s latest response has been so strong. The risk then for this breaking into a full conflict is great and the next few hours will be telling.However, there are strong indications that neither Israel, nor Hamas wants a full-scale confrontation.Hamas knows if there\u0027s another war, Israel will likely not stop until the organisation and all its \"terror infrastructure\" is destroyed.But for Israel to achieve such an outcome would involve having to send a land force into the Gaza Strip - and then deal with the post-Hamas humanitarian fallout and the nightmare of a restive and hostile population of more than two million."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-line-18-nick-martin_4323608.jpg?20180529152010 ","title":"line 18 skys nick martin explains why he is proud to be northern","story":"The North East has a proud tradition of heavy industry, not just building ships, but mining coal to generate electricity and landing fresh fish to feed the nation.I did not know it at the time, but I was born into a period of huge social and economic change - a period that would cause untold damage to the North, its industry, its people and especially its men.By November 1979, oil prices and rising wages led interest rates to soar to an all-time high of 17%.This crippled manufacturing and across the north of England businesses closed and national unemployment crept up to three million.:: How wealthy is your region? By the time the 1990s came along, shipbuilding, mining, steel production and coal had been pretty much obliterated.People like my father were either unemployed, working abroad or had managed to cling on to work locally.This turbulent period in British history was captured rather well in the cult TV series Auf Wiedersein, Pet, a comedy-drama about a gang of seven British workers escaping the mile-long dole queues in England to take up cash-in-hand jobs in West Germany.Men and their roles in society were changing in a way that would be depicted two decades later in The Full Monty, a film which told the story of a group of out-of-work steel workers stripping to make money and rebuild their self-esteem.:: Podcast: The changing face of the UK:: Podcast: What do robots mean for the future of work?

I have often wondered why did not he say anything and I will never know.Almost all the indicators we use to measure deprivation are weighted towards the South, including life expectancy, heart disease, cancer rates, suicide, alcoholism, levels of tooth decay, literacy, road investment, wages and GCSE results.You name it, the North fairs worse. But how can this be?:: London is the most unequal place in the country Successive governments have either ignored the problem or deliberately diverted money to the South, where the perceived benefits to the national economy are greater.The reality is that the North-South divide is a black mark on the whole of Britain. It perpetuates inequality of the worst kind, pits regions against each other and neglects those areas of greatest need.Government policy has tried to direct funds through regional development initiatives, enterprise areas and grants, but there is very little evidence to suggest that these schemes have brought the economic prosperity intended.And Brexit won\u0027t help these areas either.:: The robots that could steal your job According to regional forecasts, every area of the UK will suffer a decline in GDP, with the North East taking an 11% hit to economic growth under the government\u0027s preferred outcome of a free trade deal with the EU.Leaving with no deal will result in a 16% dip, and staying in the single market would cause a 3% decline.These areas are as vulnerable today as they have ever been and things have to change.Governments have to take this seriously, otherwise we run the risk of damaging not just one generation, or two, but leaving permanent scars on whole swaths of Britain that have been left to rot because they are out of sight and out of mind."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-meghan-markle-wedding_4314240.jpg?20180518222846 ","title":"meghan markle effect boosts supermarket sales","story":"There was a noticeable spike on the Friday before the wedding in Windsor and Chelsea\u0027s clash with Manchester United at Wembley, with grocers cashing in on \u0026#163415m worth of sales over the 24 hours.Sales of burgers and sausages rose by 39% and 12% respectively, while non-alcoholic beer purchases were up by 64%, during the last month.More than 16.6 million households bought ice creams, while sun care products also flew off the shelves with sales up by 64% on the same period last year.All of the \"big four\" supermarkets clocked up rising sales, but were out-performed by fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Morrisons performed particularly well with sales growth of 2.9% ahead of the overall market as it attracted an additional 311,0000 new shoppers through its doors, followed by Asda (2.8%), Tesco (2.2%) and Sainsbury\u0027s (1%)."},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday activities kids family","story":"AdvertorialFrom gazebos to kids’ tents – how to make the most of your outside space this bank holiday and half termHave a brilliant bank holiday with these ideas from Halfords\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:23, 25 MAY 2018Updated13:01, 30 MAY 2018AdvertorialGet out and enjoy the upcoming time off\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou don\u0027t have to go to a campsite to have some outdoor fun this bank holiday. Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.

This week I challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg live on the radio because he is making misleading claims about what leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union will mean for small business owners like me.  For the last twelve years I have established my own European Express Transport Business, mainly transporting for “just in time” supply chains. This includes collecting components for the automotive industry all over Europe and delivering them to 24-hour production lines back in the UK.  Some of my customers include Ford in Dagenham and Bridgend, Jaguar Land Rover in the Midlands, BMW Mini in Oxford and Nissan in Sunderland, as well as Rolls-Royce on the south coast. All these car makers rely on the express movements of goods to assist in the smooth operation of their production lines, as they do not have the space to stockpile. Prompt collection is absolutely vital.  Most of the jobs I work on are only made possible by being inside the Single Market, which gives me access to the goods, whilst being in the Customs Union means no physical border to clear them.  Politicians like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Kate Hoey talk a lot about Switzerland being a possible model for how the UK could operate outside the EU and outside the Customs Union.  Well I’ve got actual experience of delivering goods from the EU into Switzerland and there are huge amounts of checks and paperwork and costs and delays involved. Believe me, it is very far from frictionless. When I was delivering goods for an exhibition there, I had to get an invoice of the goods in advance from the client, pay an upfront cost (to be claimed back later), contact a customs agent at Dover to let him know what was I delivering, wait hours in a car park whilst the paperwork was being cleared, drive to Switzerland and then clear customs again at the Swiss border. None of this is necessary if you’re in the Customs Union. Norway is another model that sometimes gets brought up, even though Norway is in the Single Market which the UK Government wants to leave (although like Switzerland, Norway is not in the Customs Union). Again, I’ve delivered goods across the Norway border and it’s not as straightforward as we are being told by the politicians. Due to the nature of the goods I was delivering, I was advised to get a carnet - a passport for goods.

Elaine Douglas and Tommy Brooks, both 51, told authorities they were living in the building, but were staying with friends on the night of the tragic fire. It took nearly a year for staff at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) to realise the flat they claimed to live in did not exist. The scam has been described as truly appalling by a senior cop. The two, both Jamaican nationals who were in the UK illegally, also tried to take advantage of a scheme allowing residents of the tower leave to remain in the country for at least five years.  Today both defendants - of no fixed address - pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of obtaining leave to remain in the UK by deception at Isleworth Crown Court. Douglas was housed in the Radisson Blu in Kensington for 276 nights - at a cost of just over \u0026pound55,000 to the council - as well running up a room service bill of \u0026pound267.35. After complaining about the food in the hotel, she was given a pre-paid credit card, running up charges of more than \u0026pound11,000. She was also handed a pre-paid Oyster card so she could travel free of charge. Brooks also started off at the Radisson Blu before being moved to another hotel. He spent 243 nights in hotel accommodation, costing RBKC more than \u0026pound49,000.  He racked up a room service bill of \u0026pound276 and charges of \u0026pound9,000 on a pre-paid credit card, and was also given an Oyster card. In total, he claimed \u0026pound58,396.89 in relief intended to help the victims of the fire, while Douglas claimed \u0026pound67,123.35. They scammed officials between August last year until their arrest on May 2 this year. Prosecutor Benjamin Holt said: The defendants both claimed to have been together in the fire. Both said they were residing in flat 91 on the 19th floor - flat 91 is actually on the 12th floor. Mr Holt told the court both had managed to avoid immigration authorities for 16 years after entering the UK illegally in the early 2000s. Following the fire at Grenfell Tower the Government introduced a policy to allow those with insecure immigration status that had lost their homes to regulate their situation. They were granted leave to remain for 12 months and that was later extended to five years.

Pest experts predict the unseasonably warm weather in the UK, with April 19 seeing Britain bask in 29C heat, the hottest April day since 1949, has led to a surge in the number of ants around the UK. Wildlife experts believe there are more than 10,000 trillion ants in the world - with around 150bn of them in the UK. Taking into account the huge rise in call-out by Rentokil, this year\u0027s ant population could be closer to 200bn - meaning more grief for British householders facing swarms of the pests in their gardens, homes and bins. Because of the huge surge in the number of ants, the number of flying ants - when ants sprout wings and go on \u0027nuptial flights\u0027 in search of a mate - this year is expected to take place earlier than normal. The event, often called Flying Ant Day, despite it normally lasting around a fortnight, usually takes place in July, but this year is expected to take place as early as June.    A spokesman for Rentokil said: There has been a significant increase in ant activity across the UK. Ant-related call outs increased 148% from March to April. Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April. Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate. If the weather remains mild, Rentokil expects higher levels of ant activity throughout the summer period. Ant life-cycles depend on temperature, and the amount of food available to them. Provided the Queen is healthy, and enough food is being brought back to the nest, ant eggs have a greater chance of survival.  Ants can hatch after just three weeks, leading to increased breeding and larger colonies during prolonged warm periods. David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July. It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves. This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer. He added: If temperatures remain high, we also expect this to really be a bumper year for flying ants, which could manifest itself at ‘Flying Ant Day’ - the ‘nuptial flight’ stage of ant reproduction where swarms of flying ants are prominent.  Some ant nests can last for several years and cover a large area - with anything from several hundred to tens of thousands of ants in each colony. Their size can make them difficult to spot indoors, but ants leave sticky residues on worktops because they are attracted to, and eat, sweet things. If you think you have a problem in your home, it’s always best to seek professional advice. Bosses at Rentokil said that the main food source for ant was sugary secretions from insects like aphids - although many will sneak into homes to feast on sugary deposits from fruit and any food left out. When one any finds a good food source it leaves a \u0027pheromone trail\u0027, which tips off ant pals about a good food source, which can see hundreds and thousands march into homes, often through cracks in doors, windows and through pipes.

But rather than the images of a magician or escapologist that the moniker may conjour, Chesney was a triple killer who scandalised the public almost 70 years ago. Wanted by Scotland Yard for the murder of his wife and her mother, having concealed the murder of his own mother years before, he was finally brought to a form of justice by his own hand shot dead in a German forest. The bullet had gone through his head. Beside him lay a gun and a letter addressed to his German girlfriend, the beautiful Sonia Winnikes, 28. It read: My dear Sonia, By the time you read this letter I will no longer be here. . . You know I am unschuldig [innocent], but with what has happened in the past it would be difficult to prove...  His death brought to an end a two-nation manhunt for \u0027Mr. X\u0027 - a suspect Scotland Yard had asked the German police to help them find. \u0027X\u0027 was wanted in connection with the murder of Chesney\u0027s wife, Vera Isobel Veronica Chesney, 43, and her mother,  Lady  Mary Menzies, 73. The two women were murdered In Sunset House, the old folks\u0027 home that Chesney\u0027s mother-in-law ran in West London. The older woman was beaten around the head and strangled and Chesney\u0027s wife was drowned in a bath - the killer had made sure she had drunk enough gin to knock her out and then lowered her into a bath and lifted her legs so she remained submerged. It emerged Chesney had sneaked into the country from the Continent and then back out again. He hoped that killing his wife would release money held in their marriage. It was a sensational end to a sensational life for Chesney, who had been born John Merrett, which included wartime heroics, a prodigious appetite for for women, food and drink, deception at every turn and murder. And as the story unravelled of who the killer was it emerged deep in his past a earlier crime which was even more shocking - the murder of his mother. John Donald Merrett the man who became known as Ronald Chesney was born in New Zealand in 1908. The family moved to Russia but his mother Bertha found that the climate did not suit John, her only child so she took him to Switzerland.  During the First World War her husband deserted and so Bertha, the daughter of a wealthy Manchester Wine merchant, brought the boy to England when he was sixteen. For a time they lived near Reading and John was sent to Malvern College to train for the diplomatic service. Bad boy When the time came for him to go to a university, Bertha moved to Edinburgh so that her son could still live at home. They took a flat in Buckingham Terrace, near Edinburgh University, where John enrolled as an art student. He was a brilliant scholar but his conduct did not match his brains. His mother,had an income of just over \u0026pound700 a year, out of which she gave John 10 shillings a week pocket money but it was was not enough for young Merrett, who soon tired of his studies. Unknown to his mother he was regularly skipping his lectures to go dancing at the city\u0027s music halls.. At night, he would lock his bedroom door and climb out of the flat by a rope, so as not to rouse his mother\u0027s suspicions. To finance his life of stolen pleasure, he forged cheques drawn on his mother\u0027s bank account - these were the days long before Internet banking and many financial transactions ran on trust. With the money he got in this way he bought a motor-cycle, gifts of jewellery for Betty Christie, one of the dance instructors at the palais which he haunted day and night and chillingly a pistol and ammunition. However he was living on borrowed time and stolen money and the cheques were to catch up with him. Murder It was on March 17- St. Patrick\u0027s Day. 1926 — that the events happened which led to John Merrett\u0027s trial on a murder charge. It was over breakfast when Bertha opened a letter from her bank to find that she was, inexplicably, overdrawn. The Merretts\u0027 maid heard a shot, then a scream and the sound of someone falling in the sitting-room. John went into the kitchen and told the maid he and his mother had quarrelled about money. And he said: My mother has shot herself.  In the sitting-room, the maid found Mrs. Merrett lying on the floor, bleeding from a bullet wound in the right ear. A pistol was on the bureau. Later the same day, John went to his favourite dance-hall, paid the fee to book Betty Christie, and took her out for the day. During a brief spell when she regained consciousness, she had said: Donald (as she called her son ) was standing beside me while I wrote a letter. I said to him: \u0027Go away.\u0027 The next I heard was a kind of explosion. I do not remember anything more. Her son\u0027s account was when his mother told him to go away he went to the corner of the room, heard a shot and saw a revolver falling from his mother\u0027s hand. His mother died a fortnight later. The twist Merrett thought he would be free to live his life how he wanted but in her will Bertha left all she had in trust for her son until he was 25. It was a blow to the young man who longed to have access to his mother\u0027s money and so he quickly wrote a string of cheques against his mother\u0027s account. However, authorities were soon on to him, curious as to how a dead woman was spending so much money, and eight months after his mother\u0027s death he was arrested on a charge of murdering his mother and forging 29 cheques on her bank account. However there were no witness and after a seven-day trial at Edinburgh High Court and a cleverly constructed defence a jury of nine men and six women returned a verdict of not proven on the murder charge.  On the charge of forging his mother\u0027s signature to raid her savings, Merrett was found guilty and sentenced to a year\u0027s imprisonment. The trial of young Merrett was regarded as one of the most sensational murder trials of the century. Love When he was freed, after serving his sentence, Merrett — as he still called himself —found refuge in the home of one of his mother\u0027s friends, Mrs. Mary Bonner, then living at Bexhill. Mrs. Bonner — she became Mrs. Menzies when she remarried after her first husband\u0027s death — had a charming and attractive daughter, 17-year-old Isobel, known as Vera to her friends. Soon they were in love and in March 1928 they eloped and married in Glasgow. However three months later the pair stood in the dock at Newcastle Upon Tyne charged with obtaining goods worth \u0026pound200 by false pretences. Merrett gave their\u0027 names as  Mr. and Mrs, John Chesney, late of Bexhill. They had been living in a tent on the outskirts of the city.  He had signed cheques in the name of McCormick, giving his address as the Grand Hotel when he had no such fortune. Merrett, alias Chesney, alias McCormick , was jailed for nine months. His wife was discharged. The trial was made the subject of a book by William Roughead, who ended the story by saying he had not heard what became of Mrs. Chesney. Then he wrote:  But you never can tell: we may do so yet.... A windfall Two years after leaving prison Chesney inherited the then huge sum of \u0026pound50,000 from his Grandfather and went on a huge spending spree. He and his wife lived for the next decade in the lap of luxury and put \u0026pound10,000 aside for the future in trust should something happen to one of them - it was a decision which would prove costly for them both. A speedboat and a two-seater aircraft - both bought with a view to smuggling - an open top Bentley, a country mansion, lavish entertainment, and a stableful of slow racehorses helped consume his money. But as the money ran out his wife tired of his love of other women and they separated. Desperate to continue his lifestyle he moved to the continent where in the 1930s smuggled drugs and arms on a run between Malta, North Africa, and Spain and spent time in a string of foreign jails. Scotland Yard believed he used his wealthy connection to help smuggle carpets, pictures and art treasure. The war hero The Second World War, when it came, was treated by Chesney as just another opportunity to make a dishonest living and he fast became known as Mr Fixit who could get anything for the right amount of money. As Lieutenant Ronald Chesney, RNVR, in command of a mine-sweeping trawler and no-one knew of his terrible criminal past. In 1954 a former sailor who served with him, Howard Johnson, described him as Hard drinking, 6ft. tall, weighing 22st., with a huge black beard, a large gold ear-ring dangling from the pierced lobe of his right ear, and a real Cyrano de Bergerac of a nose - he was a man of violent action who lived to the full.

Harper Mitchell Hyslop is the only person in the UK, and possibly all of Europe, suffering from a type of children\u0027s interstitial lung disease (chILD) that is so rare that it has no name. While her friends are off enjoying their summer holidays, Harper carries oxygen in a backpack and stays at home with her parents Jodie, 38, and John, 40. Harper, from Balloch, West Dunbartonshire, is left panting like a puppy when the sun comes out because her lungs are so inflamed - and is aggravated in the heat.  At first, her parents were confused about what was happening to Harper when she became ill at just five-years-old. The couple watched their daughter for eight weeks as Harper\u0027s flu-like symptoms were initially misdiagnosed as a virus before being diagnosed with chILD in 2016. Jodie said: Her eyes got really dark, she was having flu-like symptoms. Her lungs had inflamed that much that she was struggling to breathe. She had lost so much weight, she didn\u0027t want to eat and she had lost 10.5Ibs.  She was admitted to hospital and got an X-Ray which showed the results of her lungs. They just didn\u0027t function properly and it becomes worse when it\u0027s warm. She pants like a puppy. You know the same way a dog would have its tongue sticking out - It\u0027s like that. At first, we thought she was having a panic attack as her chest went up. ChILD is a broad term for a group of rare lung diseases causing a lack of oxygen in the blood. But Harper\u0027s condition is so rare to the point that it doesn\u0027t have a specific name.  The interstitial tissues are inflamed meaning Harper has difficulty passing oxygen. Harper had to carry oxygen canisters when she was first diagnosed but she then started taking liquid oxygen from a backpack which Jodie believes lasts much longer. Social care worker Jodie says that her daughter needs frequent rest and is sad that her condition means that she has to miss out on hanging out with her friends. Jodie added: Due to the condition, it means although she can eat properly, she needs to have cool showers.  She tends to rest frequently and she can\u0027t be out in the heat like her friends. She feels sad about that but it\u0027s about trying to teach her how to work with her condition. And she does well with that and she knows when she needs to rest when she\u0027s out with her dad. She loves going on her scooter and going to the park. To cool her down she would eat ice poles and yes it is a bit isolating but she does take it on her stride. Sometimes she feels like she can\u0027t be with her friends.

MPs are calling for a ban on brand-generated characters or licensed TV and film characters which are used to promote foods high in fat, sugar or salt on broadcast and non-broadcast media. Such a ban would mean characters such as Kellogg\u0027s Tony the Tiger and Nestle\u0027s Milky Bar Kid would have to be dropped or used to promote healthier products. And cartoon characters from the latest summer blockbuster would no longer appear on the packaging or adverts for fast food. But characters such as the Jolly Green Giant could continue to be used to promote vegetables.  When TV chef and campaigner, Jamie Oliver gave evidence to the Health and Social Care Select Committee he said cartoons and superheroes should not be used to peddle rubbish. Instead, he said they should be used to promote healthy foods. Meanwhile, the MPs have urged the government to take action on advertisements when it produces its next chapter of its childhood obesity plan. Ministers should ban junk food ads before the 9pm TV watershed, the committee said.  Health campaigners have long been calling for changes to junk food advert airing times - saying that the current restrictions do not apply to family viewing time. Meanwhile, supermarkets should also be forced to remove confectionery and other unhealthy snacks from the ends of aisles and checkouts. And junk food price promotions, such as multi-buy discounts and extra free promotions, should be restricted, the MPs added. The government should also give local authorities more powers to limit the proliferation of unhealthy food outlets in their areas and councils should be able to limit junk food and drink billboard advertising near schools.  The raft of recommendations come in the committee\u0027s latest report into childhood obesity. A third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, according to official figures. The group of MPs call for a whole system approach to tackle the issue. This includes a call for the government to end sponsorship deals by brands overwhelmingly associated with high fat, sugar and salt products of sports clubs, venues, youth leagues and tournaments.   Meanwhile, social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube should reduce children\u0027s exposure to inappropriate advertising and marketing, including advergames.  A recent report from Public Health England showed that the food industry has failed to meet a sugar reduction target set by the government. Retailers, manufacturers, restaurants, cafes and pub chains were told to cut 5% of sugar by August 2017. But the report showed that food manufacturers and supermarkets only cut out 2% over the first 12 months of the sugar reduction programme. Puddings had actually increased the amount of sugar and chocolate bars had made no change whatsoever.  MPs called for the government\u0027s next childhood obesity plan to set out further fiscal measures under consideration following the sugar tax on soft drinks. They also called for the tax to be extended to milk-based drinks such as milkshakes. Children are becoming obese at an earlier age and staying obese for longer, said Dr Sarah Wollaston, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the committee. Obesity rates are highest for children from the most disadvantaged communities and this unacceptable health inequality has widened every year since records began. The consequences for these children are appalling and this can no longer be ignored.

Flooding of homes and businesses could happen quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds. Fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures and where flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train and bus services. Power cuts might occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost. Some communities might become cut off if roads flood.    However, it looks like brighter conditions could extend across much of the country by the weekend with temperatures reaching the mid-20s. There will still be the prospect of thundery showers, especially in the south, and it will remain less warm in the east. But the rest of the country should stay dry with long bright spells. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: A weak pressure pattern will result in a showery outlook for central and southern Britain with thunderstorms but there will be some good spells of sunshine between the showers. The best of the sunshine and dry weather will be across the north. It should be generally fine into the early part of June, but there is a chance that cooler conditions could arrive by the middle of the month.

Smoke-free areas are expected to be in place in hospital grounds, schools and playgrounds by summer 2019. Strengthening the laws around smoking in public in Wales will further protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke and de-normalise smoking for children and young people, according to the Welsh government. While most schools and hospitals already have no smoking policies in their grounds, it is currently difficult for staff to enforce this.  Wales\u0027 Health Secretary, Vaughan Gething, has visited the maternity unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, where staff told him they had received complaints from mothers about people smoking outside the hospital when they enter and leave with their newborns. The changes will make it illegal to smoke in the hospital grounds, with legal backing for fines for smokers breaking the rules, therefore improving the environment for patients, visitors and staff, says the government. Vaughan Gething added: I am proud that Wales continues to be at the forefront of UK action to reduce smoking and prevent young people from taking it up in the first place. We have seen significant changes to the attitudes to smoking since 2007.

The unidentified drinker is said to have reacted angrily - and disgustingly - after being refused shots at the swish bar in Newcastle.  Chronicle Live reports the punter allegedly wiped her backside with toilet roll before scattering pieces of used loo roll around the venue - including leaving one sheet under a cushion.  Bosses at Tiger Hornsby have condemned the absolutely disgraceful behaviour, which is said to have happened on Thursday night. Staff, who bosses claim were forced to don gloves to clean it up, were left horrified - and shared CCTV footage with other venues to warn them about what happened.  “There were three [tissues] at the bar, some on the floor - one was even stuck behind the cushion as a surprise for whoever was there next,” one barmaid claimed. Manager Rachael Frame, 39, said: “I’ve never known anything like it in my time working in the bar trade. “The closest thing to this was the time a sanitary item was put on the floor.” However, the difference in this case is that staff believe the alleged act to be malicious. According to workers, two girls arrived at the upmarket bar at around 8pm and ordered drinks to watch live music.  “They didn’t seem too bad at first,” admitted a barmaid. “But they got over-excited.” One girl approached the bar to buy shots but was refused for being too drunk, the unnamed worker said. “She was a bit argumentative but not too bad. Then the other girl came over and started shouting at me.” Fearing she was just going to buy her mate drink, she was also refused service.

Mari Llewellyn, 24, originally from Wales, weighed 17st 5lb before she radically changed her lifestyle and started eating cleaner food. “I’ve learnt what food is nutritional for my body, she explained. I eat more than I did then and some people are surprised by how much I weigh but it’s because I’m tall and I’ve built muscle. Mari, who moved from Newport to New York, US, when she was 10 years old, took up weight lifting as well as adopting a disciplined diet.  She originally started eating a bodybuilder’s diet which was full of high protein food such as chicken and eggs, Wales Online reports. But now, she eats a diet that’s higher in fat. Today, the 5ft 11in fitness blogger weighs a healthy 12st and works out six days a week. In just over a year, she lost 170 pounds – or 5st 3lb. She shares her progress on Instagram, YouTube and her fitness blog, Mari Easy Fitness, and has attracted tens of thousands of followers. Mari said: “It all started when I was in my final year of university. “I struggled with depression and anxiety and I ended up having to drop out and move back home for a bit. That’s when I started to eat lots of pizzas and unhealthy food.  “I decided to make small changes, like eating cleaner food and my boyfriend was really into bodybuilding, so I started to get into the gym. “I went from hating the gym to loving it. Seeing my body change motivated me more.” She added: I taught myself a lot about the gym. I was doing a lot of the same exercises as my boyfriend but then I learnt how to do things that I wanted to do like tone my butt.” Mari, who recently completed her degree in fashion and retail in Philadelphia, has also released fitness programmes called Fit with Mari and a resistance band which sold out online. “It’s something I love doing and I’m doing it full time at the moment,” she continued.  “People think being a social media influencer is easy and all you have to do is post a few photos, but it’s hard work. “I’ve also used some of the things I learnt [at university] which I didn’t think I would do. I had to work on the sizes and the designs and work with prototypes.” Mari puts part of her social media success down to being an ordinary woman who has worked hard for her body. “When you go on Instagram, it can be scary because it’s just full of beautiful women,” she said. “But I think more people can relate to me because I did use to be overweight.

Amber Traxler, 33, is speaking out alongside her son Jared after in a bid to raise awareness around mental health and suicide prevention. Jared had tried to take his own life in June 2016, exactly one year after he discovered his 53-year-old grandfather, Jake Meyers, dead in bed when he popped to his house to borrow a fishing rod. Jared, of New Haven, Kentucky, USA, struggled to cope with his grief in secret until he attempted to take his own life at his grandmother\u0027s house ahead of a summer. Mum-of-five Amber says she will never forget the moment she discovered her son hanging in a bedroom after attempting to take his life.  Amber and her mom Tilly Meyers, 53, became worried when they discovered Jared had locked himself into a guest bedroom and was not responding when they knocked. After discovering Jared\u0027s lifeless body, full-time mum Amber called for help as his grandmother Tilly got him down and began performing CPR. Jared was airlifted to Norton Children\u0027s Hospital in Louisville where he was placed in an induced coma and remained on life support for five days. Doctors were unsure of how long Jared had been deprived of oxygen and feared he could be brain damaged. But Jared survived and he has now spoken out in a bid to help others who are struggling with their mental health. In a tear-jerking video clip, the schoolboy said: It\u0027s OK to talk about how you feel. Being involved in sports and going fishing keeps me active and feeling great. I hope my story helps somebody and remember all y\u0027all are loved and worthy.  Amber said: He never wanted to talk about his Pawpaw and I thought his change in mood came down to him becoming a teenager. I never thought he would do something like this. I had never heard of a kid as young as Jared doing something like this. We were all at my mom\u0027s house. I could tell that Jared was in a bad mood, and when he went into her guest bedroom I didn\u0027t think much of it. She started calling his name and he wasn\u0027t answering her which immediately worried her. She went to open the door and found it locked. She got the key and that\u0027s when I heard her scream. I will never forget that scream - my heart jumped up into my throat. We managed to push the door open and he was on his knees, he had hung himself. His face was black, his lips were purple. He was dead. My mom got Jared down and started CPR.  On the street I saw a man from the Water Department and I yelled, I begged him to call an ambulance. I ran back into the house and my mother had managed to revive him. He at least had a pulse. Within minutes the fire department, the police and the EMTs had arrived and a helicopter had landed in the local baseball field to airlift Jared to the Children\u0027s Hospital in Louisville. We drove to meet him there and before I was allowed to go into the room, the doctors prepared me for the worst. He was unrecognizable. He was hooked up to so many machines and he was intubated. I couldn\u0027t believe that a ten-year-old would want to do this. I felt so guilty that I had missed the signs. Jared was on life support for four or five days and I felt like I was going to lose him. The doctors struggled to regulate his temperature and he had suffered a collapsed lung. They worried he may have been deprived of oxygen for too long and could be brain damaged. Stay-at-home mum Amber described the relief she felt when her son opened his eyes after doctors attempted to pull him out of the coma.

Laura Watson claims the small child can be seen with his hand on her son’s shoulder in the creepy image. The family had been enjoying a picnic at the Plessey Woods Park last weekend when Laura took some pictures of her daughter Charlotte Hill, 15, and son Byrin Watson, nine, climbing a tree with their cousin Jack, 16. However, medical receptionist Laura was left “terrified” when she later discovered the face of another child had appeared behind Byrin, despite no one else being near them in the park at the time.   While originally sceptical of anything to do with ghosts and the paranormal, Laura says the picture has changed her mind as the boy is so clear.  She now wants to return to the woods as the figure has sparked her interest in ghosts but admits she hopes the apparition doesn\u0027t “follow them home”. Laura, from Newcastle, said: It\u0027s very unusual and everyone is really freaked out. Me and my daughter couldn\u0027t even go to sleep last night because we were so scared. My husband is on night shifts and I was alone and I was like \u0027oh God\u0027. I was terrified in case anything had followed us back.  I\u0027ve had people on our Facebook saying they are going to send me prayers.  I didn\u0027t believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.  Laura had been enjoying the sun with her mum, dad and sister, along with her two children and her niece and nephew when they decided to walk the dogs after finishing their picnic.   On the way back the youngsters came across the large tree and began to climb it - prompting Laura to get out her camera. Laura said: There was no one behind the tree, my daughter or my nephew would have seen them. There was nobody there. There was only us there. It\u0027s very, very bizarre. When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin? When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like \u0027but there was nobody there!\u0027 It looks like a child to me, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a girl or a boy. But I can see this face and it looks like the hand is on my son\u0027s shoulder, which is very bizarre. Some people have said I must have Photoshopped it as they can\u0027t believe it. But I\u0027ve explained that I wouldn\u0027t even have a clue how to do anything like that.  It was literally taken on a phone. I\u0027m rubbish with technology and I\u0027m just not the kind of person to do that. There\u0027s no way that is anything but what it is - you can basically see a face. For someone to be that close to my son, if it was another child, he would have noticed them. I would have seen them and I wouldn\u0027t have taken a picture with another kid behind him. Many have speculated what the figure could be with some suggesting it might be the spirit of a boy who drowned in the woods years ago. Laura said: I don\u0027t know much about the history of the woods but some people are saying that many moons ago a young boy drowned in the river. You don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just hearsay. People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that. I\u0027ve not had any kids die in my family so it couldn\u0027t be anyone that I know. It certainly isn\u0027t something that I\u0027m familiar with. I\u0027ve never, ever experienced anything like it in my life. It was just a normal day. It was lovely hot day and we were just having fun.

A dad-of-three who tried to help Andrew Westlake moments before the fatal fall was left so shaken by what he witnessed he had to see a doctor after returning home. He is still haunted by Andrew\u0027s last moments in which he looked sad and desperate. The dad, his partner and their three children - aged two, four and six - were queueing to check in for a flight when the horrifying incident unfolded at Dalaman Airport. Tourists said Andrew, 30, jumped over a glass barrier and plunged about 50ft from a balcony, telling a witness as he lay dying that he just wanted it to end. His family have said he was on his first family holiday since the birth of his daughter.   Andrew, from the Annfield Plain area of Co Durham, had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the fatal fall.  It is understood he had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his partner and one-year-old daughter, but was alone when he fell around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The 34-year-old dad who tried to help Andrew went to see a doctor on Wednesday because he\u0027s been left so distressed, his partner told .  The woman, 29, added: He hasn\u0027t slept. He\u0027s been sick constantly and he can\u0027t even eat anything. The doctor has given him some sleeping tablets and told him not to go into work. She said they had to carefully explain the incident to their three young children and shield them from the grim details. She added: My six-year-old daughter was asking what happened to [the man]. I haven\u0027t told her. I just said he\u0027s hurt his leg and he has to go to hospital to fix it.  The woman said the family, from Watford, were at the back of a queue for a Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted Airport in Essex when they heard a loud noise. She said they turned around and saw the man on the floor after he had apparently run into the barrier. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again.  When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. The woman said she called out to Andrew as he lay on the floor below, and frantically alerted airline and airport staff as dozens of Brits were gathered for flights home to Stansted and Birmingham. She said of Andrew: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock. She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage.  A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. Another holidaymaker said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to Andrew\u0027s aid, told her that he said he just wanted it to end as he lay dying. The 23-year-old woman, from Hertfordshire, told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge.  My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK. He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick.  The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly. After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had suffered fatal injuries after falling from the exit of a plane and landing on the tarmac. But witnesses said those reports were inaccurate and that he plunged to his death inside the terminal. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days waiting for a flight back to the UK. When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports  Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough.  Andrew\u0027s Facebook page stated that he was from Stanley in Co Durham and had previously worked as a roofer and at Clayton Glass, in Annfield Plain.  The tourists said they decided to speak out about the incident because they want to correct the initial media reports, and they want the man\u0027s family and friends in the UK to know what happened before his death. Reports claimed Andrew had been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before he fell to his death, but the Leeds-based holiday firm declined to provide details about whether he was prevented from travelling.

Guerrero is a living hell on earth where residents constantly fear for their safety - and kidnapping, gun fights and murders are every day events on the streets. In one horrifying case a game of basketball among friends ended with one of them being beheaded, according to Doctors Without Borders. The irony is that within the region sits one of the most popular and well known holiday resort names in the world - Acapulco - which attracts almost a million holidaymakers a year, many of them rich Americans arriving at its port on cruise liners. But beyond the bustling beach resorts of Acapulco lurks a dark underworld of criminal gangs who have helped the city earn the title of now being the third most dangerous in the world.  The British Foreign Office currently warns that there have been several instances of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in Acapulco and warns to be extra vigilant in (the city) and surrounding areas. But it\u0027s advice that few are heeding. In March, hotels in the Zona Dorada, the area overlooking Acapulco Bay, were reportedly at 86% occupancy - whereas the story for those who live there permanently is not so sunny. Territory across the state is fought over by organised criminal gangs, meaning drug-related crime has forced many schools to close and the insecurity and surges of violence have had a direct impact on medical care.  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is desperately trying to help people in the region with mobile clinics featuring doctors, nurses and psychologists in 11 communities.   “A lot of doctors don’t want to come anymore (but) the nurses do, thank goodness, says resident Bruno. We haven’t had a doctor for four years, so the MSF visits are essential of course. And it is clear why from the horrific and heartbreaking situations residents are forced to live with every day. A young man in his 20s, who wanted to be referred to as Abel, told MSF medics: “Every so often we see corpses dumped in public places. It’s traumatic to see because people have been tortured and cut up. The beach resorts rose in popularity from the late 1940s through to the 1960s as Hollywood stars flocked to city. John F Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy went on honeymoon there and Elizabeth Taylor married Mike Todd in the resort. Frank Sinatra also sang about it in his popular song, “Come Fly with Me” and Elvis promoted it in his romantic film, “Fun in Acapulco.” One day, when we were playing basketball, a group of armed men arrived at the court. They shot at us, threw us on the ground and took away our mobile phones and money. Then they attacked us with machetes. They took my friend. They cut him up. First they cut off his leg, then his arm. He’d already passed out by the time they cut off his head.” During a meeting with a local health committee in one of the towns in Guerrero, a dozen women described how insecurity had affected their communities. “There’s fear, there’s mistrust, there’s no happiness anymore,” said one of the members.   Tourist dead and another fighting for life after gunman opens fire in packed Acapulco nightclub  “I used to go out at night without any hassle. But now we go straight home. I go to bed and I don’t know what will happen.” Another woman added: “We’re a group of chickens in the coop, we don’t know who’s going to be grabbed next for the pot. Many of the local health centres across the state are now run by just one nurse who also sleeps at the facility. These nurses have very few resources and must carry the burden of healthcare in their communities. Javier Lopez de la Osa, one of the MSF doctors working in Guerrero, added: “A lot of our patients cannot access basic healthcare because of the violence in the region.  “Coupled with problems of ingrained poverty, we see a real lack of follow-up care for pregnant women, which can lead to serious complications and even death in childbirth. “There are hardly any services for chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. Without medical care, conditions that were previously well managed get progressively worse and eventually become acute, severe and in some cases life-threatening.  The Tierra Caliente, Norte and Centro regions, together with the city of Acapulco, in Guerrero state are some of the most violent places in Mexico .  Los Cabos, in cartel-plagued Mexico, was named the most violent in the world according to the report by Mexican think tank Security, Justice and Peace. Caracas in Venezuela came in second, making it the world\u0027s most dangerous capital city.  Laura Moreno is MSF’s mental health activities manager in Guerrero. “We provide medical and mental care to people affected by the violence in the region, she said. “We run individual and group sessions and psychosocial activities, to strengthen patients’ coping mechanisms and help rebuild the social network damaged by violence. This can be challenging as we only visit each community once a month because of the volatile context. “We carried out 1,270 consultations in 2017, and treat people who have been through very traumatic experiences. Some have had family members killed, and others have family members forced into criminal gangs. People in Guerrero have a tough, fighting spirit, but if the fear and violence persist, the fabric of society could be torn apart. Guerrero’s illegal marijuana and opium trade has been a catalyst for most of the violence across the state, forcing people to emigrate or leaving them cut off for months on end.  Juan, a 61-year-old farmer who visited one of MSF’s mobile clinics, described how drug traffickers had threatened the public transport in his town to divert all economic activity to their territory in the north.  ”If there’s a medical emergency, now we have to pay up to 1,500 pesos to go in a private van,” he said.  The daily wage is between 120 and 200 pesos. “It’s a terrible situation nobody wants to spend three and a half hours on the road to reach an available public transport. And we cannot go at night because of the risk of being attacked on the roads. “We see things happen, but we cannot talk about them,” Juan told MSF staff.  “Our house was attacked by armed men a few months ago. My sons aged ten and eleven were also there. They’ve been frightened and traumatised ever since. We can’t leave them alone anymore.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i want end holidaymakers say","story":"News\u0027I want it to end\u0027: Holidaymakers say British dad fell to his death after jumping over Dalaman Airport balconyAndrew Westlake, 30, from Co Durham, died after falling to his death in Dalaman Airport in front of stunned British tourists\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitchingSophie Doughty11:25, 30 MAY 2018Updated13:47, 30 MAY 2018NewsAndrew Westlake, 30, died after falling from a ledge at a Turkish airport (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British dad who died at an airport in Turkey plunged about 50ft to his death after jumping over a ledge inside the terminal and claimed he just wanted it to end, say traumatised witnesses. UK tourists have told of their horror after watching the man fall to his death at Dalaman Airport as they prepared to fly home following beach holidays. A holidaymaker said the dying man, named by his devastated family as Andrew Westlake, 30, from Annfield Plain in Co Durham, told a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to his aid, that he just wanted it to end. Andrew had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the incident. He had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter - their first family holiday together - and members of his partner\u0027s family, but was alone when he fell.  His aunt, Pauline Butler, told ChronicleLive that her family was notified of Andrew\u0027s death by Durham police on Tuesday, but they haven\u0027t been told exactly how he died. She said Andrew\u0027s grief-stricken mother June, 54, is heartbroken and can barely speak. Family members had been reading news reports and contacting witnesses who wrote about the incident on Facebook to learn more. Multiple witnesses told  that initial Turkish media reports - that Andrew died after falling from a plane\u0027s exit onto the tarmac - were not true. A 29-year-old woman from Watford, who was flying back to the UK with her 34-year-old partner and their three children, aged two, four and six, said the incident happened inside the terminal around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The family were among dozens of Britons queuing to check in for flights to Stansted Airport in Essex and Birmingham when they heard a loud noise as the man apparently ran and crashed into a glass barrier of a balcony.  The woman, who was preparing for a delayed Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted, said they turned around and saw the man on the floor near the barrier just behind them. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again. When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. She called out to him and alerted airline staff as he lay on the floor about 50ft below and people rushed to help him. The woman also called out to airport staff, but it appeared they didn\u0027t understand English, she added. She said of the Brit who fell: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock.  She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage. A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. An image posted online and verified by witnesses shows the moment Andrew went over the glass barrier. A 23-year-old woman from Hertfordshire told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge. My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK.  He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick. The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly. After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days at the airport waiting for a flight back to the UK.  When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports. Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough. Andrew\u0027s Facebook page stated that he had previously worked as a roofer and at Clayton Glass in Annfield Plain, where he grew up with four siblings. His aunt Pauline, 67, said relatives are still in the dark over how he died. She added: We really don’t know what to think. His mum is absolutely devastated. They were very close.

Doctors were suspicious of the 26-year-old man\u0027s explanation - and suspect the object was put there for \u0027auto-erotic purposes\u0027. The man\u0027s case was subject to a report in the British Medical Journal which explained that the man managed to detach the rest of the shower and make his way to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi, India. Although the man appeared to be in good health, and was not bleeding, X-rays clearly showed the shower head was six inches inside the man\u0027s body.  According to the BMJ report, after the man was under general anesthetic, the surgeons used a technique of gentle anal stretching before reaching in and pulling out the item. The man recovered well and was discharged 48 hours later. According to the Daily Mail the report read: History is often ambiguous and incomplete due to a high level of embarrassment and social stigma attached to the condition. The same was seen in our case.

She said the toddler\u0027s behaviour had been unusual and that she was failing to settle later that night. Stacey said: She pretty much just swallowed her dummy while she was asleep. I was so scared, I thought that she would have internal injuries or something like that but it was really lucky.   According to a hospital spokeswoman, Aurora was admitted to hospital but thankfully only suffered a minor tear in her intestine while passing the dummy, the The Daily Mercury in Queensland, Australia reported.

It’s definitely significant.“It’s across the whole ward. I’ve also had reports from the Charleston and Wellbank areas.”Mr Malone added: “There’s nothing to suggest at the moment that it’s anything to do with cleanliness.“I raised concerns about vermin when the new bins were rolled out last year.“Council officers are aware of it and they’re going up to take a look and see if they can find out what’s causing it.“Hopefully other councillors will keep a close eye on their wards to stop any further outbreak.”Brian Baird, operations manager for Eliminate – a pest control service which works in Dundee – said the most likely cause of the infestations was the rats having a plentiful food source.He said: “The usual reasons for them being in an area would be a food source – obviously around places such as takeaways that deal with food a lot or if there was somewhere else that food had been left.“The best thing to do to try to prevent rats is just general housekeeping – being vigilant.”Mr Baird also warned people not to ignore signs of rats because there are a number of illnesses that can be passed on to humans through the rodents’ urine or faeces, notably Weil’s disease.Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis that is carried by animals, most commonly rats and cattle.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Pest control officers have attended the site and will revisit later today for further investigation and action where necessary.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1f489e53b-478x564.jpg ","title":"clarks goals can leave dundee united in good nick ex teammate believes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis allegiances these days lie on the other side of the street but Bobby Mann looked on with approving interest as Dundee United fixed up lower division scoring machine Nicky Clark last week.As well the fact he’d like to see his home city back with two Premiership clubs, the former Dundee defender’s attention was sparked by the fact he’s a former team-mate of the new Tangerines striker.And he believes he’s exactly the type Csaba Laszlo needs to get United to the top flight.After leaving Dens Park in 2007, Bobby joined Peterhead and it was during his time at Balmoor his and Clark’s paths crossed.He’s quick to point out, though, back then the there was little indication the teenager he first saw in action would go on to get the goals he has.“I remember him coming to Peterhead, on loan from Aberdeen and then being signed up when he was released by them,” he said.“With us he wasn’t a striker but operated in midfield. He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1e2cc7499.jpg ","title":"dundee council calls last orders on pub after revoking its licence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee licensing chiefs have called last orders on a Hilltown pub after revoking its licence to trade.Boyds Bar closed its doors suddenly earlier this month, having been trading at the Rosebank Street premises for nearly a year.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council confirmed that the licence for the venue had been revoked as there was no designated manager at the premises.The pub has gone through as many as four owners in recent years.Previously called McAdams Bar, it was rebranded Boyds Bar earlier this year.Events including a medium night had been held at the pub as recently as last month.One former patron claimed the pub had “barrels” of potential, saying: “I’m aware that the premises have changed hands a number of times in recent years.“It was called Boyds Bar for a number of years before it was changed to McAdams and rebranded Boyds Bar.“It’s always sad to see a pub close but I was aware it had been struggling to make a go of it.“Given the right management it still has barrels of potential to be a great local for residents.”The closure comes amid tough trading conditions for Hilltown pubs after The High Corner on neighbouring Kinghorne Road failed to attract new suitors following its closure last year.Janet Hood, who runs Janet Hood Consulting and represents publicans in licensing cases, said any change to a designated manager within a public house would require the owner of the business to notify the licensing board within seven days.She said: “Not knowing the full circumstances of this particular case, it is hard to ascertain what exactly has happened.“You have to have a designated manager – that is the law.“There could be a number of reasons to change the designated manager, whether the person is sacked, loses their personal licence or passes away.“As long as you notify the licensing board within seven days you have six weeks to replace the person or you are no longer allowed to trade.“I tell all my clients for all intents and purposes to have two personal licence holders at all times.

My first one was about Banana being very serious but Orange wanting to have a party.Banana was furious when he came home and Orange had all the fruit and vegetables over for a party.Orange had to say sorry.I also did all the drawings for my book and my Grandad Kelly said it was brilliant.My school is Newport Primary and I am very lucky to have great friends – Zerah, Eva, Darcey, Ava-Ruth and all my classmates.They love getting to hear my stories at homework sharing time every week.Just now, I am writing stories about my class. I put jokes in too.Sometimes people don’t laugh but my mum/editor says this happens all the time, even to comedians, so I shouldn’t let it bother me.My first class story was about how we were all kidnapped and there were no teachers around so the pupils saved the day.My second story was about how we lost someone and I found him and saved the day.In my third story, we were all locked in and had to be saved by the primary ones.My next story will be called “Chaotic Classroom”.

I am very impressed by your penguin designs and delighted to hear that they were inspired by watching Blue Planet II. How fabulous that they were chosen for the sculptures and for such a worthy cause.“Congratulations and thank you for writing to let me know. With best wishes, David Attenborough.”Rebecca, who is a massive fan of Sir David’s nature programmes, said, “I was very excited to receive the letter as I didn’t expect a reply.“I felt honoured as I know he’s very busy. It was very nice of him to take the time to read my letter and respond.”Rebecca said that after watching Blue Planet II she wanted to raise awareness about plastic polluting the world’s oceans and she hopes her design will show the “good side and the bad side” of the sea.“I hope people who come to see the High School penguin like the design but can also take away a deeper message,” she added.Rebecca’s winning design is being painted on to the blank sculpture by F6 pupils Morven Wright, Joanna Brunton and Lily Bircham . After being given its make-over, the statue will then join 79 others on display on the streets of Dundee and beyond from June 29th in the Penguin Parade, a charity public art event that aims to raise enough money to fund the Maggie’s Centre Dundee for a year.And the entire High School community is getting behind the campaign. In addition to the design contest, the School has also already staged a Bingo Night and held a Penguin Day in the Junior Years and Nursery, with more fundraising events to come.The school’s Charities and Community Outreach Co-ordinator, Karlene Douglas, said, “Rebecca’s entry was chosen as the winning design for our penguin sculpture because it is both visually stunning and incorporates an important environmental message about our planet.“David Attenborough’s documentary series was a crucial inspiration to Rebecca’s design and so as a school we were delighted when he responded to Rebecca’s letter, congratulating her on winning the competition.“We are proud to support the Maggie’s Penguin Parade and look forward to seeing our finished sculpture outside the school gates.”Maggie’s Centres provide free practical, social and emotional support for people with cancer and their families and friends.

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":" Don t let my kids see me like this   Springburn woman s plea for Mexican MS treatment","story":"                          A \u0026ldquoDESPERATE Springburn woman is continuing her urgent appeal to raise \u0026pound50,000 for life-changing MS treatment before another devastating relapse."},{"url":null,"title":"Cyclists slam new plans for revamped Byres Road","story":"                          A CYCLE group has said multi-million plans that could mark \"the biggest change to Byres Road in decades\" are a let down."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/6818869.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Who could Celtic face in the Champions League qualifiers ","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS players \u0026ndash at least those not on international duty -

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/roadmap-632x564.jpg

almost three hours late – the full 156-seater plane tried to land at Dyce and had to quickly ascend due to thick fog – and the same happened when it tried again.The pilot then prepared a third landing attempt from a different direction – but then diverted to Glasgow.The aircraft landed around midnight and passengers were taken by coach and taxi back to Aberdeen.Some arrived home at 5.30am yesterday, including Linda McGillivray, 25, of Northfield, who described the delay, the failed landing attempts and the diversion as “quite a disaster”.Describing the first landing attempt, she said: “We descended fairly quickly and it became apparent by the quick descent something was wrong.“The very quick ascending of the plane was fairly frightening, especially when we could see that the weather was bad.”Apology from easyJet bosses as Aberdeen-bound plane diverts to GlasgowLinda was returning from the Creamfields Steel Yard Weekender music festival in Finsbury Park, London, with three pals, including Tessa Clark, 27, of Torry, who said: “We could feel a big descent and could see the lights below.“The lights of the runway were visible. I felt the plane speed up and rise again fast – and that happened twice. Then we diverted to Glasgow. The whole experience was horrible.”Colin Bell, 25, of Berryden, said: “At Glasgow Airport, everything descended into chaos. I didn’t get in the taxi until 3.30am. I got home at 5.40am and had work at 8am.”Ms Clark praised Glasgow Airport staff for staying late to attend to passengers.An Aberdeen International Airport spokesman said: “I can confirm the delayed easyJet London Gatwick flight was unable to land at Aberdeen due to low visibility.“Arrangements were made by the handling agent for easyJet at Glasgow to provide ground transport to Aberdeen for the passengers on the inbound flight.The passengers arrived by bus at the airport at approximately 4am yesterday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"apology from easyjet bosses as aberdeen bound plane diverts to glasgow","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAirline chiefs have apologised to passengers after a plane twice aborted landing attempts.An easyJet spokesman confirmed a flight from Gatwick was unable to land at Aberdeen due to poor visibility and diverted to Glasgow, causing the next Aberdeen-to-Gatwick flight to be cancelled.He added: “easyJet did everything possible to minimise disruption for our passengers, providing coaches and taxis to transport customers to Aberdeen, and for passengers on the cancelled flight, easyJet provided the option to transfer their flight free of charge or receive a refund, and provided passengers hotel accommodation and meals where required.“The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority, and while this was outside of our control, we would like to thank passengers for their patience and apologise for the inconvenience caused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"balamory and river city actor to star in this years panto at aberdeens hmt","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSomething wicked this way comes as River City star Juliet Cadzow heads for His Majesty’s panto.The Scots actress will play the Wicked Queen in Snow White this Christmas, joining Holby City star Lee Mead, who will play the Prince.Juliet, who also played Edie McCredie in the CBBC children’s series Balamory is a seasoned veteran of Scotland’s pantomime scene.She has worked extensively with panto icons such as Stanley Baxter, Jimmy Logan, Rikki Fulton and Elaine C Smith.Now Juliet, who plays Suzie Fraser in River City, will be joining Aberdeen’s own panto legends Alan McHugh and Jordan Young in Snow White from December 1.Jane Spiers, Aberdeen Performing Arts chief executive, said: “Juliet’s impressive career speaks for itself and we couldn’t be happier to welcome her to HMT for this year’s panto.“I can’t wait to see what her and the rest of the cast have got in store for us.”Jane’s enthusiasm was shared by Michael Harrison, managing director of the panto’s producer, Qdos Entertainment.“We are delighted to have Juliet with us in our Aberdeen pantomime this Christmas,” he said.“Juliet is a much-loved Scottish talent and we know she’s going to be wonderfully evil in her role as the Wicked Queen.”Snow White is written by McHugh – who will play the dame, Nurse Nellie MacDuff – and will mark his 14th HMT pantomime.The festive treat will feature a magical mirror, seven friendly dwarfs, a beautiful princess and a handsome prince.It promises plenty of participation as audiences help our heroes outwit the Wicked Queen and let love prevail in this magical show.Tickets for Snow White are on sale now.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/59e5aebf3e38d-848x564.jpg ","title":"colourful mural to reflect history of popular park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mural is set to deliver a splash of colour – and a dose of history – to a popular Aberdeen park.A new community group has been created to paint the artwork on the Gardener’s Bothy in Seaton Park and work has now started.It is being carried out in collaboration with Friends of Seaton Park and the Seaton Community Centre Art History Group.The project became a reality after the community centre received participatory budget funding from Aberdeen City Council.It is hoped the finished mural will capture scenes from the popular park, including the family favourite train attraction Mr Therm.The group meets every Monday from 1.30pm, weather permitting, to work on the bothy.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It was a suggestion that was made a long time ago, I’ve been trying to get it done for years.“There’s an artist in residence at the community centre, so he’ll be taking the classes.

bring their kids to Banchory to skate, it’s already in the middle of a very popular park, and the parents can go off into the community, and visit the shops, or buy an ice cream, or whatever they want to do.“It’s not a tourist attraction, but it will do no harm to have an extra thing in the community.”Banchory and Mid-Deeside councillor Eileen Durno is also hopeful the plan will benefit the area.She said: “Hopefully people will come to Banchory to use the skatepark, and maybe visit other places in the town as well.”Plan for new north-east skatepark backed by council officersCouncillors handed the plans for the skatepark a major boost last week, as the Marr area committee offered its support to BSG to pursue a lease for the land.On the committee vote, Russ said: “We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the existing ramp, regularly updates the skaters in Banchory about the progress of the park.He said: “They’re all really excited about the prospect of the park, but of course,

squad.Shinnie, 26, earned a debut cap in Scotland’s 2-0 friendly loss to World Cup-bound Peru.Pittodrie captain Shinnie is in contention to face Mexico at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium on Sunday morning.Scotland begin the bid to reach Euro 2020 later this year with Nations League ties against Albania and Israel in September.Scotland legend Willie Miller believes Shinnie has the pressing game needed for those clashes.Reds’ defender Scott McKenna secured his third straight cap in starting in Lima but his handball led to the penalty for Peru’s opening goal.Miller said: “Shinnie can play in competitive games like Euro qualifiers.“He plays in an area where Scotland have a lot of players (midfield).“However, Shinnie brings a different dynamic to the midfield in terms of the way he plays.“He leads that pressing pack for Aberdeen and is the first one to try to win the ball back which is an important element of the modern-day game.“Particularly if you are looking to press the game and win the ball back early.“There are two games coming up against Israel and Albania where Scotland should be desperate to get the ball and have as much possession as they can.“Shinnie adds that dynamic of physical enthusiasm to the midfield that would serve Alex McLeish and Scotland well in top competitions.“He has plenty of experience as well.“The manager can only give him a chance and he has the experience so there is no reason why he cannot take it.”Shinnie was introduced as a second-half substitute for Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch with 15 minutes remaining.Shinnie had been in previous Scotland squads but had yet to be capped. He was an unused substitute in the 1-0 friendly loss to Holland at Pittodrie last November under then interim boss Malky Mackay.Dons great Miller, capped 65 times, said: “I am delighted that Shinnie has been given a chance as I see what he gives to Aberdeen.“He has been outstanding and is someone that leads by example.“You are talking about the captain of the team that have finished second in the Premiership in recent seasons and has played in cup finals.“Shinnie has also lifted the Scottish Cup with Inverness Caley Thistle.“You are not talking about an untested player and he deserves the opportunity to show he is good enough at international level.“Shinnie merits it for the station he holds within Scottish football and on performances.“He is definitely of a high enough standard.”Shinnie was one of seven players securing a debut Scotland cap in Lima. Peru extended their record unbeaten run to 13 games courtesy of goals either side of half-time from Christian Cueva and Jefferson Farfan.Dons defender McKenna played for 90 minutes. The 21-year-old’s hand ball conceded a penalty for the opener.It came from a blunder from debut keeper Jordan Archer where Farfan’s shot struck the Don’s elbow.Miller said: “The standard McKenna has set himself for a young lad is incredible.“He is still young and still learning the game.“Yet out of nowhere he has burst on to the international scene and looks as if he has been playing there for years.”Former Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean, who will return to parent club Norwich this summer, earned a fourth cap.Boss Alex McLeish praised the seven new caps for coping with the conditions.McLeish said: “I’m proud of the mentality they showed in a cauldron of a place.“They embraced it.“Bringing these guys into the team for the first time, they handled it really well.“It’s a squad where everybody deserves a cap.“It was hot out on the surface, especially when you’re doing a lot of chasing, which the Peruvians made us do.“Peru are a super team, they move it about well and know each other inside out.”McLeish’s depleted squad are set to be reduced further with some players leaving ahead of the friendly against Mexico.He said: “We’re going to lose a couple of players now.“Lewis Stevenson is going away.“We had an agreement with him to play the first game.“Matt Phillips is going back to England for an engagement there, which we agreed a couple of months ago.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 18","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/05/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,According to a report that appeared in your edition of April 27, a traffic accident occurred on the A83 near Lochgair at 2.30pm on Saturday April 21.It is further reported that the A83 between Lochgilphead and Inveraray was closed to traffic \u0026#8216while investigations were carried out\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 before re-opening \u0026#8216in the early hours of Sunday April 22\u0026#8217.Even if the early hours is taken to mean, say, 1am on the Sunday morning, this suggests the principal route for access to and egress from Mid Argyll and Kintyre \u0026#8211 as well as the  ferries \u0026#8211 was arbitrarily closed by police for some eleven and a half hours.I would like Police Scotland to explain why this was necessary.I well remember a retired police officer telling me that, in the days prior to Argyll entering the stranglehold of Strathclyde Police, the local superintendent would want to know the reason why if the scene of an accident was not re-opened to traffic within about 30 minutes.Police Scotland should understand that (a) the usual excuse (lengthy closures are necessary in order to gather information thought useful in prevention of similar accidents in the future) will not wash (b) perusal of any half-decent road map will reveal to Police Scotland that, unlike the central belt, Argyll does not have a multiplicity of short alternative routes suitable for use as diversions and (c) their one-size-fits-all approach is a negation of management.If Police Scotland is so keen to glean evidence relative to a traffic accident they might also look at actual or potential accidents resulting from these enormous diversions \u0026#8211 fatigued drivers \u0026#8211 drivers unfamiliar with diverted routes \u0026#8211 difficulties finding overnight accommodation \u0026#8211 insufficient fuel \u0026#8211 appointments missed and so on and so on.Eric Box, XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSir,You may recall that I incurred a ruined tyre while driving through the roadworks at Strone Point on the A83 back in February.I claimed for £270, which was the cost of the rescue and renewing the tyre, against the trunk road maintenance contractor, BEAR Scotland, who had let the road deteriorate to such a dreadful state while road improvements were going on.While they haven\u0026#8217t admitted liability or anything as rash as that, they have, on the other hand, offered to pay me £250, most of the expense I incurred.I have accepted this offer and I thought you might publish this as an encouragement to others who have suffered expense for similar reasons.It pays to complain.Graham Thomas, St CatherinesSir,Having held a successful evening of music at the Argyll Inn in Lochgilphead on Friday April 27, the Easy Club would like to thank a number of people and organisations.Thanks to the ownership/management/staff of the Argyll Inn and the donators to the prize draw the Co-op, Danny\u0026#8217s, Dalriada DIY, the Smiddy, Fyne Living, ABC Bookshop, the Archway and Marmalade Deli.Also all the helpers and carers, and the many musicians, and the enthusiastic audience who came along to enjoy the evening.As we start to plan workshops for the coming months we would be very happy to welcome new participants.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Red Star won their only previous title \u0026#8211 SAFL Fourth Division \u0026#8211 in 1988 under manager Hughie Lindsay. There have been promotions, relegations and plenty of drama in between, but never a league crown.Red Star manager Dougie Moore said: \u0026#8216This is a major achievement for the club and for a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216We only have a small squad, but with some excellent players, many of whom have been involved with the Soccer Centre, which deserves great credit.\u0026#8216Seeing them play football with a smile and allowing them to express themselves on the pitch has been extremely pleasing and a personal highlight.\u0026#8217Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang and lead drummer Graeme MacMillan, Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the British Pipe Band Championship at Grade 4B.Craig, now in his sixth season leading the band, was \u0026#8216absolutely delighted\u0026#8217 to clinch first place among 21 competing bands.He added: \u0026#8216The band had an average age of 18 on Saturday at Paisley with four players in their first competition, one still in primary school.\u0026#8216It has taken years of hard work and a lot of that can be credited to Rod Buchanan for chanter lessons and Donald MacLachlan, our drum tutor.\u0026#8216It is also a great result for Graeme MacMillan, who returned after a five-year absence from the pipe band circuit to win a major.\u0026#8217The band celebrated in style on their return from Paisley with an impromptu performance in Lochgilphead town centre to the delight of band parents and supporters.Before heading to Tarbert on Sunday May 27 to play at the Scottish Series sailing event, Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be at the Ropework in Lochgilphead the day before to help Red Star celebrate.Star will receive the Premier 2 trophy at 3.45pm on Saturday and it is an occasion not to be missed.PICS:Mid Argyll Pipe Band members celebrates after their championship success. no_a21MAPBchamps01Pipe Major Craig Lang clutches the British championship trophy. 06_a21PipeBand08Lochgilphead Red Star AFC, league champions. 06_a18RedStar_TeamPhoto_home01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the

branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles.

now cleaned up at the bank, so it\u0026rsquos a very natural point to go off and do something else, he told reporters.\n\u0026ldquoI mean the bank\u0026rsquos back in great shape, ready to be privatised, so I know people are always surprised by the news, but they really shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised by the trigger points that create the news.\nProtesters make their voices heard outside the Royal Bank of Scotland annual general meeting in Edinburgh (Andrew Milligan/PA)\nThe search for a successor will begin immediately.\nMr McEwan credited him with helping resolve a number of the bank\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquomajor legacy challenges during his tenure.\nThe announcement of his departure comes just as\u0026nbspexecutives are expected to face a barrage of questions from shareholders.\nThe bank is likely to be quizzed over plans to kickstart dividend payments after recently agreeing a 4.9 billion US dollar (\u0026pound3.6 billion) settlement with US regulators.\nThe deal, which related to claims RBS mis-sold toxic mortgage bonds in the run-up to the financial crisis, paves the way for the resumption of payouts, ending a barren decade for investors.\nIt is also facing pressure over plans\u0026nbspto shut 162 branches in England and Wales following a review of its network.\nThe lender said earlier this month that it was targeting sites that were in close proximity to other branches, as it starts to reintegrate its Williams \u0026amp Glyn network back into the core bank.\nOn Tuesday, RBS said it will no longer fund Arctic oil projects and pledged to cut lending to firms profiting from coal as part of an updated energy policy meant to take a harder line on climate change.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new
