Brexit was the first and primary topic of discussion and interruption on the first Question Time since the Christmas break, and Bruce was praised for pressing guests on the Brexit deal, Conservative leave strategy, and alleged Labour electioneering over the EU.Bruce took over from Dimbleby who had presented the often-heated debate show for 25 years.The show had received some criticism for recitations of various party lines, and sometimes angry clashes.The new-look show was filmed in the Jeremy Corbyn heartland of Islington, and featured voices from both sides of the isive Brexit debate."},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Harrys 2 5m Cotswolds love nest owned David Camerons property tycoon pal","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan’s Cotswolds country hideaway is owned by a millionaire pal of David Cameron, who stands accused of letting his own Georgian mansion fall into disrepair          An aerial shot of the country home, where the couple have hosted several A-list friends, including the likes of George and Amal Clooney and Serena Williams          An aerial shot of the rural idyll that Harry and Meghan have chosen as their secluded country home  The £2.5million four-bedroom farmhouse, nestled deep in the Oxfordshire countryside, was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex last year by  businessman Nicholas Johnston Four bedrooms, two kitchens, outdoor dining area and a staff...Share this articleAs well as their celebrity friends, Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland has also visited the farmhouse, which dates back to the 18th century and comes with four bedrooms.It is preferred by the couple to Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where they currently reside when in London.Harry and Meghan acquired a two-year lease in May last year and moved in before their wedding.

Meghan\u0027s first four patronages represent a key step for the duchess, who is still in her first year as a newbie royal.According to the royal family\u0027s website: \u0027Royal patronages add status to an organisation, and visits and involvement from a royal patron can often bring much-needed publicity.\u0027Meghan will have been inundated with requests from charities asking for her support since marrying the Duke of Sussex in May. Members of the royal family each receive hundreds of pleas each year.Most royals tends to limit their patronages to a manageable number to allow them to devote enough time to each.The Duchess of Cambridge has 17 and has focused on early intervention for children.The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have more than 1,000 patronages between them, many of which were inherited from previous monarchs.According to he royal family\u0027s website, the most influential member regarding patronages is still the Queen.\u0027The Queen\u0027s patronage carries the most weight, and Her Majesty receives the most requests for patronages of all the members of the royal family,\u0027 the site says.          Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charitiesIn 2016, following her 90th birthday, the Queen stepped down from 25 patronages, including the NSPCC, which was taken over by the Countess of Wessex, and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, which went to Kate.          The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700sNow she has handed two over to Meghan, with the duchess becoming patron of the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.But the monarch - the nation\u0027s longest reigning sovereign - still has 599 patronages or associations. Philip stepped down as patron or president of more than a dozen organisations when he turned 90 in 2010.He was patron, president or a member of 785 organisations at his retirement in 2017, and continues his association with them behind the scenes.Diana, Princess of Wales, made a shock announcement following her orce in 1996, when she ended her links with more than 100 charities.She resigned her position as patron or president from all but six - Centrepoint, the English National Ballet, the Leprosy Mission, the National Aids Trust, London\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital.Those she stepped down from included Help the Aged, Barnardos, Relate and the Parkinson\u0027s Disease Society.The princess - William and Harry\u0027s mother who died in a car crash in 1997 - said she made her decision \u0027with great sadness\u0027, but wanted to concentrate her efforts on fewer causes.The first recorded patronage was George II\u0027s involvement with the Society of Antiquaries in the 1700s.The organisation was concerned with architectural and art history, conservation and heraldry.It still exists today and and the Queen\u0027s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, is its patron.Patronages generally reflect a royal\u0027s interests, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, who is president of the National Osteoporosis Society after both her mother and grandmother died due to the brittle bone disease."},{"url":null,"title":"Vigilantes use metal plate tattoo Por Rata Rat suspected oil thiefs back","story":"    A man suspected of stealing oil from residents near Mexico city was punished by vigilantes who placed a hot metal plate over his upper backThe suspect fuel thief appears in the video laying face down on a street in Ecatepec, a town north of Mexico City, according to Mexican news outlet Criterio Hidalgo. His head is covered with a black hood and his hands are handcuffed.The suspect lets out a loud moan as the vigilante presses the hot metal plate over his upper back for a period of 18 seconds before the video cuts off.Is this Australia\u0027s most bizarre burglary?

Firstly, could we get over feeling sorry for Theresa May?Bruce, who has taken over from David Dimbleby to host the programme, then interrupted her, saying: \u0027Hang on, hang on - do you never feel sorry for her?\u0027And the woman replied: \u0027No, I don\u0027t feel sorry for her. She is the woman who for many, many years has led the hostile environment for migrants in this country - which resulted in the Windrush generation, it\u0027s a disgrace.\u0027She\u0027s the person who created her very specific red lines on immigration in the ECJ which have created the negotiation mess that we\u0027re in. She triggered Article 50 when she had no plan.            The woman delivered a forceful 80-second speech which criticised the Prime Minister             Fiona Bruce was hosting her first Question Time after taking over the role from David Dimbleby\u0027And as to criticising the EU on this, there are 27 other countries in the EU. They have been completely united on this. We do not even have a cabinet who can unite, and definitely a government that isn\u0027t in control of the process.\u0027They are a body of rules and regulations and they are not going to break that when it\u0027s the most successful single market in the world, and all round the world people want to do deals with the EU.\u0027We are going to lose all of that, and it is ridiculous for us with our hopeless government who cannot get it together, to actually work out what the will of the people is today in 2019 to blame the EU and to go around feeling sorry for Theresa May. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027The woman\u0027s speech was tweeted by the official Question Time account, and had received 12,000 likes along with more than 4,000 retweets by 8.30am today.            Among those praising it was University of Oxford politics lecturer Jennifer Cassidy, who tweeted: \u0027We will all remember where her were when Fiona Bruce pointed to the audience and said: \u0027Yes, the woman in the yellow jacket.\u0027\u0027Yellow jacket woman made more progress, offering more insights in 90 seconds, then Theresa May has done in 31 months.\u0027Clare Wigley said: \u0027This lady said eloquently and succinctly what many of us are feeling.

Brexit was the first and primary topic of discussion and interruption on the first Question Time since the Christmas break, and Bruce was praised for pressing guests on the Brexit deal, Conservative leave strategy, and alleged Labour electioneering over the EU.Bruce took over from Dimbleby who had presented the often-heated debate show for 25 years.The show had received some criticism for recitations of various party lines, and sometimes angry clashes.The new-look show was filmed in the Jeremy Corbyn heartland of Islington, and featured voices from both sides of the isive Brexit debate."},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible moment Chinese rocket carrying countrys new state art satellite takes off","story":"The satellite, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, has entered the preset orbit.The Chinese-made communication and broadcasting satellite will provide transmission services for the country\u0027s radio, television stations and cable television networks.The Zhongxing-2D satellite and Long March-3B carrier rocket were both developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.China launched a record-breaking 39 orbital missions in 2018, and Friday morning\u0027s was the 298th mission of the Long March rocket series.Russian workmen destroy building\u0027s entrance foyer when they...Share this article    China sends Zhongxing-2D satellite into space on a Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province at 1.11am, January 11, 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"No deal Brexit cause GDP shrink 8 cent","story":"Boris Johnson, 54, spends New Year with his new ex-Tory aide...\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...Share this article    Carolyn Fairbairn has urged MPs to back Theresa May (pictured above) and put the country before politics \u0027Businesses would face new costs and tariffs.

Last night’s show had four women – host Bruce, Thornberry, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson and newspaper columnist Melanie Phillips – and two men. Some things are harder to change (or perhaps they don’t want to try). Only two members of the panel were Brexiteers. The old Establishment-Remain bias is deep-set.\u0027She\u0027s had 15 years of greedy vase-owners... and now she\u0027s...\u0027Bet the Woman in the Yellow Jacket would negotiate a deal\u0027:...Too safe, polite, and generally ¿lovely¿, like Jodie...Question Time presenter Fiona Bruce is pictured in the hot...Share this articleOne hour and just two topics: things became a bit bogged down. We had Brexit, Brexit, Brexit – much of it focusing on Thornberry – and then a quarter of an hour on knife crime. That choice was presumably down to the editors and producers but Madam Chairman Bruce should be encouraged to become a lot more brutal when it comes to telling people to shut up. That applies to members of the audience, too. A man with a hat became a frightful bore and could have been zapped at the end of his first round of applause.Dimbleby used to let panellists have their opening say pretty much uninterrupted but Bruce jumped in quickly to question Tory MP James Cleverly while he was giving the programme’s first answer (to the question ‘has the Government lost control of the Brexit process?’). Time and again she chased Cleverly and Thornberry, pinning them down when they were being slippery.Such pursuit of the truth is fine up to a point but you have to let panel members actually make their initial points. As a result of the verbosity and the interruptions it was something like 17 minutes before one of them – a stand-up comedian called Nish Kumar – actually said a word.    The hose clashed with Emily Thornberry over whether Labour should be backing a people\u0027s voteMind you, when he did start spouting forth, one rather felt he might have been better advised to remain completely schtum for the duration. A simplistic, shouty sort. He tried attacking Phillips for criticising the Macpherson report on the police.Bruce’s best decision of the night was to let Phillips have a counterblast and it produced a scintillating moment when Phillips comprehensively flattened Kumar, asking him if he had read the report. Er, he hadn’t. Oops.During one of Thornberry’s orations, Bruce pointed out that the audience was laughing at her evasions. During one of Cleverly’s flannelings, she intervened to say she was ‘still waiting’ to hear what his Brexit Plan B was.These added to the saltiness of the programme but they arguably went a little beyond what a proper BBC debate chairman should do. And her sarcasm when she commented on an audience member’s remark about Brexit’s ‘sunlit uplands’ left a faint tang, too.But on the whole this was a pretty decent first bash. She controlled the nerves she must surely have been feeling and she proved a lot more objective and charming at chairing a debate than that bloke Bercow. "},{"url":null,"title":"Formula One Racing Champ Lewis Hamilton snaps Manhattan penthouse","story":"Racing legend Lewis Hamilton (left) forked out a cool $40 million for a stunning penthouse apartment at a development at 70 Vestry Street (right)          Hamilton bought a luxury apartment at 443 Greenwich Street (pictured) in November 2017 The property has four bedroom and s 6,457 square feet in addition to more than 3,000 square feet of outdoor space.

I couldn\u0027t believe it when I realised.\u0027          Dr Hillan only uncovered the Austens\u0027 link to Lord George Hill in 2006 by accident, when she saw a footnote about him while preparing a lecture. It led her on a five-year treasure hunt through historic documents, and it was only subsequent online articles about the book which enabled Mrs Levers to work out her album belonged to the familyShe contacted an academic Dr Sophia Hillan via Twitter after spotting she had published a 2011 book about Jane\u0027s nieces called May Lou and Cass: Jane Austen\u0027s Nieces in Ireland.Dr Hillan only uncovered the Austens\u0027 link to Lord George Hill in 2006 by accident, when she saw a footnote about him while preparing a lecture.It led her on a five-year treasure hunt through historic documents, and it was only subsequent online articles about the book which enabled Mrs Levers to work out her album belonged to the family.Dr Hillan, a retired associate director of the Institute of Irish Studies at Queen\u0027s University Belfast, said: \u0027The album is remarkable. When Karen shared some of the photos with me I could hardly believe it.          Historians are currently pouring over the album and experts are hoping to stage an exhibition of the photos in the future\u0027Her nieces were very important to Jane Austen, which gives this album a special significance. She knew them well, not least because she went to stay with them, effectively as the poor relation coming to help look after them.\u0027She often supervised the three girls - Cassandra, Marianne and Louisa - sometimes even doing their mending, listening to their reading, taking Marianne to the theatre and the dentist when she was only twelve, or letting them stay in the room as she discussed her plots with her sister or made notes for her novels. She was part of their lives.\u0027Jane Austen was dead by the time the girls grew up, but they lived out, quite without meaning to, the plots of her novels.\u0027Take Marianne - her life in some ways echoed the plot of Sense and Sensibility. She found herself like Elinor and her namesake Marianne pretty much evicted from the house by her own brother.\u0027And when Cassandra fell in love with Lord George Hill, his mother was less than pleased because she had no money.\u0027Just as in Persuasion, they had to part for eight years until, like Persuasion\u0027s Captain Wentworth, he returned and they could marry.\u0027Lord George\u0027s mother echoed Pride and Prejudice\u0027s Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were, quite uncannily at times, living out the plots of Jane Austen\u0027s novels.\u0027As in the novels, this album shows naval and military men, women who were compelled to marry well or live upon the goodwill of male family members, foolish or devoted clergymen and questions of inheritance or disinheritance.\u0027In the novels, the heroines have often lost a parent at a young age - and we see that time and time again in this album. Cassandra died in childbirth just like her mother. The parallels are there.          This one shows the Rev Charles Bridges Knight with two women\u0027I think those parallels prove the truth of her insights, reminding us of her ability to see into the workings of the world around her, and the dilemmas that young women and indeed young men faced.\u0027It reminds us of the inadequacy of claims that Jane Austen leaves out the great traumas of her time. She reflected them in her plots, so strangely re-enacted in the lives of her nieces, in this album.\u0027To see these illustrated in the pages of this album underlines the universality of her work. Her work is full of deep profound truths.\u0027To see in these rare photographs the faces of those I have been writing about for so many years is quite extraordinary.\u0027Historians are currently pouring over the album and experts are hoping to stage an exhibition of the photos in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"BMI flight 22 passengers veers Bristol Airport runway","story":"    The BMI plane that had 22 passengers, on the grass after it left the runway at Bristol Airport           The Embraer 145 plane came to a halt with the front wheel embedded in the grassAlthough shaken by the experience, the passengers and crew on board the Embraer 145 plane were unscathed.Audio recordings from inside the cockpit revealed the panic of the captain - who was under training and new to both the aircraft and the airline.The commander - who was mentoring the trainee captain - suggests that the speed brake should be used as the aircraft comes in for landing.Man, 62, dies after being decapitated by a helicopter blade...Economist, 54, who is accused of assault after three cabin...Share this articleThe pilot responds: \u0027It is, oh no it\u0027s not, who closed that?\u0027A synopsis of the incident says the flight crew noticed the nose gear touched down \u0027sharply\u0027 after the main gear before the pilot lost control.The report reads: \u0027The pilot flying was unable to maintain directional control during the landing roll and the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway onto the grass.          The pilot engaged the parking brake instead of the air brake as he approached the runway          The commander suggests that the speed brake should be used as the aircraft comes in to land\u0027At some point during the landing the throttles were moved forward, reducing the rate of deceleration.\u0027As the aircraft left the paved surface the crew realised that the landing had been carried out with the emergencyparking brake set.\u0027The aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll.\u0027The pilot had had 17 hours of flight time in the Embraer 145 and his training had progressed well up to that point, the report states.Investigators concluded the shape and location of the brake levers may have contributed to the incident on December 22, 2017.\u0027The accident arose as a result of the inadvertent selection of the emergencyparking brake instead of the speed brake,\u0027 the conclusion reads.          The damaged landing gear and tyre following the incident in Bristol on December 22, 2017          The passengers and crew on board the  plane - which landed at Bristol Airport - were unscathed\u0027The levers are of similar shape and sited close to each other but with a different appearance and mode of action. There is also a brake on indicator light.\u0027These risk controls proved ineffective in preventing the inadvertent selection of the emergencyparking brake both on this occasion and on at least two previous occasions.\u0027Once the parking brake had been set there were opportunities to detect and correct the error, but a busy flight deck environment together with a high workload contributed to it going unnoticed.\u0027After touchdown, the aircraft may have remained on the runway surface but for the addition of forward thrust during the landing roll.\u0027The manufacturer stated that it did not intend to conduct a system review relating to the parking brake status.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"US official says troop withdrawal Syria started","story":"    The U.S. has started \u0027the process of deliberate withdrawal from Syria\u0027.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from the last two weeks, just a small selection from the bumper crop of end of year lists that you’ve posted over the holiday period. The breadth and depth of reading on display has been most impressive. Plenty of wisdom has also been garnered from those books, as Rick2016 demonstrates:Of the 45 books I read this year (which most people think is a lot but pales in comparison to many of the people in this forest!), the standouts were the following (roughly in order):Vikram Seth - A Suitable BoyRichard Powers - The OverstoryDavid Park - Travelling in a Strange LandGraham Greene - The Quiet AmericanMargaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s TaleJL Carr - A Month in the CountryJohn le Carré - The Spy Who Came in from the ColdSomerset Maugham - Of Human BondageLima Barreto - The Sad End of Policarpo QuaresmaEdward St Aubyn - Never MindTatiana Salem Levy - The House at SmyrnaPenelope Lively - Moon TigerLooking at my reading this year, I learned three things:1. It’s good to make the time to read those long novels that I keep meaning to read. Some, like A Suitable Boy would have been worth it if they had been twice as long.2. Having a perception of an author’s style through hearsay, or even reading only one of their books, isn’t the same as actually reading them properly. Greene, le Carré, Atwood, Dickens and others turned out to be far richer experiences than I expected.3. TLS is an absolute goldmine for recommendations. I knew that already but there are several books that I loved this year that I would never have read if it weren’t for you folks’ advocacy. So thank you so much.Here’s another 2018 summary, from interwar:Putting together my annual list was a great reminder of so many hours well spent. My 20 ‘most rewarding reads’ of 2018 include fiction only, and I’m well aware that some of my choices directly contradict others’ judgements. Note that by ‘most rewarding’ I don’t necessarily mean most enjoyable. Mostly these were books that made me think and stretched my imagination.Four were re-reads:Wilkie Collins, The MoonstoneE M Forster, A Passage to IndiaR K Narayan, The World of NagarajOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayTen were translations:Shusako Endo, VolcanoWolfgang Hilbig, Old Rendering PlantIsmaiil Kadare, The Traitor’s NicheWalter Kempowski, HomelandLaszlo Krasznahorkai, The World Goes OnAyiyujo Nosaka, The Cake Tree in the RuinsOrhan Pamuk, SnowAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in BaghdadJose Saramago, The Elephant’s JourneyMario Vargas Llosa, The StorytellerAnd the rest:Elizabeth Bowen, The Last SeptemberRoland Camberton, Rain on the PavementsGabriel Jiosipovicii, The Cemetery in BarnesPhilip Larkin, A Girl in WinterWilliam Maxwell, The Folded LeafAlex Pheby, LuciaI could have included dozens more lists of similar quality – although. it should also be said that plenty of contributors didn’t catalogue their reading or didn’t read quite such vast numbers of books. One of the great things about TLS is that it takes all sorts – and all are welcome. On that note, I also enjoyed these spy and crime recommendations from beerbart:I got the Xmas present that I wanted, the latest Ben Macintyre The Spy and The Traitor. My love for his work can only continue as this is another top class non-fiction thriller brimming with interesting facts from the late Cold War. However, being hardback, it is far too big on my commute. So I have a Maigret mystery in the bag, Maigret and the Minister which I’m rifling through. I mainly read these for the unique atmosphere Simenon invokes. I also have another part of Deighton’s Samson series on the go via Audio. Spy Hook. I’m not yet in love with this series but I’m too invested in the characters to drop out.Meanwhile, dothebathosphere has already finished their book of 2019: The Faint-hearted Bolshevik by Lorenzo Silva:It’s a “punk” book, the first sentence has the narrator describing his soul being located in his nether regions and it pretty much stays in that register. The narrator seeks revenge on a woman who he ran into the back of at a traffic light. He starts with prank calls and stalking but then sets eyes on the woman’s 15-year-old sister, revenge is off the table the narrator sets his mind to being a “child abuser”. (I use quotes only because he has second thoughts in the course of his lechery before he’s tried anything physical).Well, the book is both repellent and very funny. It’s a cult hit in Spain and astonishingly often recommended to pupils as secondary school reading.Ellie Rose has also just “devoured” Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman:I started reading it on the train, walked around my house reading it, made dinner reading it (the meal suffered slightly, I must admit) and finally finished it about 9pm, feeling like I’d taken a punch to the gut. I found it unbearably sad, but darkly funny too, and sweet and overall very human. As a first read for 2019, it augurs good things for the year, I think!Finally, a challenge from vermontlogger following a “re-re-reading” of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations:I thought I would just read the first chapter or two. Then of course there was no stopping.

I had this unsolvable problem outside of our house, and 100 yards away in my studio I have this passion for an art form that is so durable.”Wearing a high-vis jacket and armed with traffic cones, Bachor has so far created 79 installations around the world including in New York and Helsinki. He creates the mosaics in his studio, fixing the artwork on a cheesecloth. Bachor then prepares the concrete on site and carefully sets the mosaic in the road. It takes about two hours, and he’s back the next day when the concrete is set to scrub off the excess.His requirements are specific – he even sent a pothole scout out in New York to find the right ones. The pothole can’t be in the centre of the street, it needs to be a road in a relatively good condition, and it must be a rough size of 18 to 24 inches, and a couple of inches deep.He doesn’t know the legalities of filling in potholes without permission, and his New York installations were removed by the city’s transport department.His work seems to cause less trouble in his hometown.“There was one time on south side of Chicago. This cop gets out and walks up to me and says, ‘Are you that pothole guy?’“‘Yeah,’ I said.“He goes, ‘That is so fucking cool.’”Find more of Jim Bachor’s art on his website.

Brexit, he told the delegates, was about the vital interests of the country, not about partisan squabbles or posturing. Addressing the prime minister directly, he said: “If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people’s rights at work and environmental standards – then we will support that sensible deal.”It was a kind of Brexit olive branch from the Labour leader. At the time, however, it felt fairly meaningless because it was not likely to be put to the test and because the Labour rank and file is overwhelmingly opposed to Brexit. More importantly, for the whole of the previous two years, Mrs May had made no effort whatever to reach out to Labour with some kind of Brexit compromise. On the contrary. All her energies had been devoted to appeasing the Conservative party’s Brexit hardliners. Right up to late 2018, when Mrs May struck her deal with the EU and began the effort to win parliament’s backing, the prime minister took Labour’s leader, its MPs and its voters all for granted.Now, that has begun to change. As she stares defeat for her Brexit deal in the face next week, Mrs May has finally accepted that she will need some Labour support if she is to prevail. This week, she met an all-party group of MPs who want to stop a no-deal exit. In the past 48 hours, ministers have also made clear that they will accept a pro-workers’ rights amendment, put forward by four Labour MPs from predominantly leave constituencies, to next week’s motion. Some reaching out is taking place. But it is all eleventh-hour stuff.The amendment is also extremely thin. It endorses part of November’s EU-UK political declaration on future relations in favour of economic regulation. It says Brexit must not “result in any lowering” of existing common standards on environmental, employment and safety issues. And it says parliament must “consider” any subsequent measures from the EU that strengthen those rights.This is a soggy formulation for matters of such importance. The political declaration, at which this amendment is aimed, is merely aspirational at present. It will only become binding if the Brexit transition negotiations, which have not begun yet, succeed – which is far from certain. So the amendment secures no binding guarantees to maintain existing standards or to keep pace with future ones. Workplace rights deserve to be treated more seriously than this.Moreover, although Mrs May has sometimes talked a better game on workers’ rights than many of her predecessors, the Tory party’s post-Thatcher failure to treat trade unions as stakeholder partners means the foundations for trust are thin, too. Mrs May phoned some union leaders on Thursday. But she could have been doing that for two years and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f01022c8242a934cfe21c24de80b6c81848d24/0_201_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebdab659785dcf041f4abcb8313d0461","title":"cleaning mrs hinch online army","story":"While most things seem to have been going down the pan, there’s been one phenomenon making a clean sweep: Mrs Hinch. The cleaning craze that swept social media in 2018 shows no sign of abating this year – and it could well help you through the January blues.For those not in the know, Hinch is an Essex hairdresser catapulted to fame through her highly watchable Instagram stories showing her … cleaning. Her followers have skyrocketed over a few months to 1.4 million people. This “Hinch army” faithfully watch her clean her immaculate house as she shares her domestic tips, which include giving names to all her products and working through a list of chores (mostly accompanied by a snatch of high-octane music) and always – always – ending the day with putting the sink to bed at night. It doesn’t sound like much, but trust me, it’s addictive.Her meteoric rise is no flash in a pan (or Flash in a toilet pan). We’re suddenly surrounded by a surge of love for keeping everything spick and . From Facebook groups for people addicted to the disinfectant Zoflora (you’d think it was the elixir of life, the way people are stockpiling it) to the festive TV adverts advocating giving a spray that prevents the smell of poo as Secret Santa presents, cleaning has been promoted to the status of a hobby. And there’s a flourishing movement to get our homes as dirt-free, as sparkly and as fragrant as humanly possible.While the country is falling apart around us, with Brexit bananas, austerity anguish and climate meltdown misery, we need to turn to bleaching our toilets. This is no coincidence. Cleaning helps us find our way through a dirty world. It can heal us, soothe us, fix us. There’s an almost instant gratification to cleaning. No job is too large, too daunting, too much of a brain drain.From dusting to vacuuming to mopping, there’s a simple, ritualistic process we can follow, and which can make us feel as if we have achieved something. We have been able to make a positive impact on the negative turmoil of the world. Work is precarious and money is tight, but my sink is spotless and still smells of Festive Fireside.There’s also a mindfulness to cleaning. Concentrating on a task – be that just wiping down your kitchen cupboards with your Minkeh – physically and mentally allows us to escape whatever’s going on around us. It lets troubled minds find a place of peacefulness. Following a process from start to finish gets us to focus on just that one job in hand, dispelling all other anxieties and worries. Cleaning soothes.I know this. At the end of last year, my brother died – suddenly, unexpectedly and, unfathomably, aged 64, from a heart attack. In the immediate aftermath of the news, I was at a loss as to what to do. So I got out my neglected collection of cleaning products, and for a few hours, I scrubbed my bathroom, from top to bottom, sobbing intermittently, going through memories as I tackled mould, coming to terms with death as I removed layers of dust. At the end of my weeping housework, my bathroom looked clean for the first time in a long while. But more than that: I felt satisfied, soothed, and ready to return to the world stronger.Maybe in years gone by, when something so awful happened, we would have gone out and found resolve in a pint or three, or found happiness through a bout of retail therapy. But austerity’s purse strings have made a mindless bender in the pub or the shop more hassle than helpful.Sophie Hinchcliffe herself admits cleaning helped her with worry and anxiety attacks many of her followers feel similarly. So don’t scoff at Dave and Vera, but rather try a spot of Hinching yourself. You may find that, like the Hinch army, you’re not just sweeping away the day’s dirt, you’re sweeping away the daily grind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c36772170554092a08f4fc183f5307c34b83b2/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6940557876acf4626dea677d11561895","title":"labour peoples vote second referendum blindfold brexit","story":"A second referendum may be difficult – but the only alternative is a ‘blindfold Brexit’Over the next few weeks, Britain faces a stark binary choice. It is not the blackmail choice that Theresa May misleadingly poses: my deal or no deal. Nor is it the choice Jeremy Corbyn still implausibly claims: her bad Brexit or his much better Brexit. The real choice we must make before B-day (currently 29 March) is this: blindfold Brexit or democratic timeout.As parliament takes back control, we urgently need the Labour front bench to join MPs from all parties in getting us to the timeout. By timeout I mean a period of democratic deliberation leading up to a second referendum, in which we decide, on the basis of everything we now know, how we should address the real problems that contributed to the vote for Brexit in 2016, what kind of country we really want to be – and whether we can do that better outside or inside the EU. For this, our EU partners will extend article 50 and give us the necessary time.Everything else – May’s deal, no deal, customs union, Norway plus, Canada plus, common market 2.0, make your own label – is just a variant of blindfold Brexit. This clarifies what might otherwise appear like total confusion. In all these variants, what Brexit actually means would only be determined in a drawn-out negotiation after we had left the EU. And once you are out, you are out. Whatever the goals set by the British government – and both the government and the goals might change – we would be negotiating from a position even weaker than we are in today. As Ivan Rogers, our former permanent representative to the EU, has warned, those negotiations would be “tougher than anything we have seen to date”.A Labour government coming to power in these circumstances would be like a street cleaner having to gather the horse dung after a Tory hunt has passed down the high street. It wouldn’t be long before the public started blaming Labour rather than the “Tory Brexit”. One of the delusional ideas still whirring around Westminster is that, having “done Brexit”, we can rapidly get back to addressing our real problems, such as housing, health and education. Brexit won’t be done for a decade, and the economic cost of even the softest Brexit will leave less money available for already stretched public services. The people hardest hit will be Labour’s working-class voters.Another delusion is that it’s up to us to decide whether to extend article 50. Not so. It also requires the unanimity of the EU 27. Nobody knows what EU leaders would do in extremis, but they have repeatedly said that they will not extend it just for more negotiations. There could be a short technical extension to allow Britain to push through the necessary legislation. Otherwise, it would require a clear determination from London to have a referendum or a general election with the option of Britain remaining in the EU. As one seasoned observer puts it: you need an extension to have a referendum, but you also need a referendum to have an extension.Here, then, is the choice before Labour. Corbyn’s speech on Thursday remained in depressing denial-and-ersion territory: elect a Labour government to negotiate a better Brexit, but the real problem is a suffering majority that has been immiserated by a rapacious elite. This is just cakeism with red icing. In the next two weeks, the choice will become real.Unless something wholly unexpected happens, May’s deal will be voted down next Tuesday. Labour will then propose a motion of no confidence, potentially leading to a general election – but that motion, too, will be defeated. If the government respects the cross-party amendment dramatically voted through the House of Commons this week, it should come back within three parliamentary working days of Tuesday’s vote to say what it proposes to do next. Since the house is currently not scheduled to sit next Friday, that brings us to Monday 21 January.May has got all the Irish backstop reassurances that she is likely to get out of Brussels. Unless a significant number of Labour MPs swallow the mind-stretching proposition that a post-Brexit Conservative government is going to be a better protector of workers’ rights than the EU, an attempt to push her deal through on a second vote will fail. If the dissident Conservative Dominic Grieve and his fellow signatories to that cross-party amendment are supported in their interpretation by the Speaker, there will be the possibility of amendments to the government motion. By this procedural means, or an explicitly “indicative” vote, parliament could test the support among MPs for different options.Crunch time for Corbyn comes then, or very soon thereafter. If he can overcome his own Lexiter (leftwing Brexiter) instincts, then Labour can lead a cross-party parliamentary majority to take the Brexit question back to the people, in a well-prepared second referendum. The onus would then be on the government to respect the will of parliament and put through the necessary legislation. If it refused, or proved incapable, then parliament itself would have to take even more decisive control over the process. A benign side effect would be to curb what is still an over-mighty executive, and create a more modern, democratic balance between legislature and executive.The very method of getting to a second referendum will already have demonstrated something of crucial importance: that this is not simply a repeat of the first. It’s not Blairite, metropolitan, liberal elites telling the benighted people to vote again until they give the right answer. No, this is part of a much larger process – perhaps including a citizens’ assembly, as suggested in a recent  editorial – which is a positive democratic response to the vote for Brexit. If this verbless phrase does not sound too Blairite for Corbynist ears: tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit.So this process would be as much about understanding the real causes of the Brexit vote, and addressing them, as about our relationship with the EU. The new people’s vote would then be a referendum on Britain’s future – who we think we are, what we want to be, and how we best get there. A convention being held in London today aims to kickstart this debate.For Labour to understand the real binary choice that we face – blindfold Brexit or democratic timeout – and plump decisively for the latter would be the best thing for the whole country, and for Europe. It would also, incidentally, be welcomed by a large majority of Labour party members and supporters, while further iding the Conservatives.I don’t for a moment underestimate all the difficulties down this route. There is no good way out of the mess Britain has got itself into. But this is the least worst path, bringing unexpected possibilities for democratic and national renewal. Go for it, Labour – or the party, this country and our continent will regret the missed opportunity for ever more.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4c94d4dca4c7eb25602e99fb83d525b9261fd1/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78b2db121f6e3257b425b04b03cb5eb6","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From Colette to Bridget Riley, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysby  Andrew Pulver,  Michael Cragg,  John Fordham,  Andrew Clements,  Jonathan Jones,  Mark Cook and  Lyndsey WinshipIntelligent, committed biopic of the French writer, AKA Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, portrayed by Keira Knightley as a sharp-witted country girl who is forced to fight for her rights in the sleazy atmosphere of fin-de-siècle Paris.

Hart is played by that old smoothie Hugh Jackman, and director Jason Reitman resists the temptation to tell a grandstanding story, preferring to concentrate on what the public expects from its politicians, and vice versa.A convincing approximation of the celebrated double act, with Steve Coogan as Laurel and John C Reilly as Hardy. This catches them in the early 1950s, on a music hall tour of the UK, a melancholic vision of legends in decline – not dissimilar to the 2017 Gloria Grahame biopic Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool.

Royal Academy of Arts, W1, to 3 FebruaryThis Artist Rooms exhibition offers a raw and provocative encounter with Mapplethorpe’s dark beauty. This Caravaggio-esque photographer of flesh and flowers changed the very idea of the camera as an artistic tool in 1980s New York when Cindy Sherman and Andres Serrano were also pushing its boundaries.

I’ve been out of the show for two and half years.” Much has happened since Ramos last recited those lyrics on the Broadway stage, in the original production of Hamilton. Ramos’s dual role as John LaurensPhilip Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s all-conquering musical has catapulted him into a career that’s so impossibly busy, you can forgive him for losing track a little. Although the words do come back to him moments later: “Oh yeah – I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow  For the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow.”Just in the last year, we’ve seen Ramos as Lady Gaga’s best friend in A Star Is Born, as clownish b-boy Mars Blackmon in Spike Lee’s Netflix series She’s Gotta Have It, and most recently as a conflicted witness to a police shooting in indie drama Monsters and Men, which won a prize at Sundance last year, and is released in the UK on 18 January. There’s more to come, including a sort-of reunion with Miranda (more of which later), the next Godzilla instalment, and the crime thriller he’s currently shooting in Massachusetts with Liam Neeson, titled Honest Thief. Drama, comedy, singing, dancing, Hollywood, Broadway – talk about smashing every expectation.Monsters and Men brings Ramos back to where he started. It is set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn a stone’s throw from his native Bushwick. His own life could have turned out much like that of his character Manny’s, he says. Of Puerto Rican descent, Ramos grew up in the projects, one of three children, regularly facing eviction and seeing his mother struggle to put food on the table. Manny also lives in the projects with his mother, his pregnant girlfriend and his young daughter. He’s just got a job, but is presented with a dilemma when he films police shooting a black neighbour outside a convenience store on his phone. The moment consciously recalls a real-life incident in nearby Staten Island in 2014, when Eric Garner died after police used a chokehold to subdue him: the struggle was filmed by a friend of Garner’s.“The world you see in the film – that was pretty much the world I grew up in,” says Ramos. “It was hard, man. It was hard knowing that you walk into a store sometimes and you’re wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie and some baggy jeans, or your skin is a little darker, and the clerk is just staring at you a little bit harder. The cops treat you a little differently.” He has friends in jail, neighbours who died. “Now people in America are starting to feel what people in the hood have felt for years because now you can see it on a video, but we’ve already been seeing this shit for years.”Ramos’s ticket out of that life came almost accidentally. He casually auditioned for a school play only to find himself cast in a major role. “I was like, ‘Read a script? I don’t even do my homework. What makes you think I’m gonna learn all these lines?’” But his drama teacher persisted. Two years later, after he failed to apply for college, she helped him win a scholarship to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.But opportunities for an aspiring Hiic actor were so thin on the ground, that he thought about quitting. So, about five years ago, when he found himself auditioning for an in-development musical called Hamilton, performing his character’s song My Shot (the one he was rapping down the phone to me) to Miranda and his team, it really was his shot. “I was just pouring it out, bro. I was singing those words as the character, but I was really singing those words as myself, cos I was like, ‘Yo, I’m not throwing away my shot for nothing. I’m about to give you every ounce I got in my body and soul and mind and my spirit.’ That was kind of how it popped off.”It was the second time Ramos had auditioned in front of Miranda. The first was four years earlier, for a national tour of In the Heights, Miranda’s previous musical, set among the Hiic community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. He came close but didn’t get the part. Everyone came to see Hamilton, though. Ramos performed in front of the Obamas, and Mike Pence, on the eve Trump’s presidency – the night a fellow cast member made a gracious plea to the vice-president for tolerance. “The most important thing for me about that night, more than the speech, is that Mike Pence saw that story unfold in front of him. He will never be able to unsee it,” says Ramos.Spike Lee also came along and cast Ramos in She’s Gotta Have It – a series based on his feature debut, with Ramos in the role Lee originally played himself. For A Star Is Born, he had to go the conventional audition route and was one of the final pieces of the puzzle, he says, but was “super-honoured” to be part of it. “That movie was special from the moment we were all on set,” he says. He had a blast, popping champagne on private jets with Lady Gaga (in character, of course), and watching her singing to Bradley Cooper in the parking lot scene: “She was just freestyling, coming up with lyrics on the spot.” Today, Ramos considers Miranda a mentor. “Lin has taught me a lot. In conversations we’ve had but also just in the way he goes about his business. I was speaking to him one time, I cracked a joke and said: ‘Oh man, I gotta stop talking hood.’ And Lin said, ‘You don’t ever have to change the way you speak you just have to make sure people understand you.’ And I was like, ‘Damn! Punch to the gut!’” Now it has come full circle. Ramos’s next gig is the movie version of In the Heights. He is playing the lead, Usnavi – the role Miranda himself played in the original stage version.For the first time, Ramos is thinking past tomorrow, you could say, but not too hard. “I’m being more selective about what I do, but really it’s just, if I love it, I’ma do it. It’s that simple. I could be paid $100 or a million. The goal for me right now is just to do stuff that feeds me, that fuels me to be the best person I can be and put out the best stuff I can put out.”• Monsters and Men is released on 18 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f61987dc02c8d60f3f8697fb4ead2e66b20c56/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5359f269bdcb7cfa9128f6b0b82a49c","title":"whats not to love the new wave of unlikable women in film","story":"From Olivia Colman in The Favourite to Nicole Kidman in Destroyer, a wave of female characters are challenging what makes a woman ‘likable’The L word is in the news again, this time because of Democrat senator Elizabeth Warren’s decision to run for the US presidency. “A common observation of Warren is that she’s simply not likable enough to win the presidency,” said the Daily Beast. “There have been questions about whether Ms Warren is ‘likable’, a word that tends to be used in regard to female candidates rather than men,” said the Finacial Times. And Politico tweeted: “How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux – written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?” And so on.Ironically, in 2016, Warren was perceived as “infinitely more likable than Hillary”. But now she has thrown her hat into the ring, commentators are lining up to remind us how uncomfortable they are with powerful women, and also how uncomfortable they are with admitting it – since their doubts are invariably couched in terms such as “there have been questions about …” In other words: “Many people say …”It got me wondering about what makes a character in the movies likable or unlikable. After all, an entire screenwriting manual, Save the Cat by Blake Snyder, is named after “the scene where we meet the hero and the hero does something – like saving a cat – that defines who he is and makes us, the audience, like him”. And no, I don’t think Lt Ellen Ripley would be nearly as popular a character if she had left Jones behind in the Nostromo to get blown up. But on GamesRadar’s list of 50 Most Likable Movie Characters, only seven are women, and of those seven, only Fargo’s Marge Gunderson strikes me as a genuinely likable person, as opposed to irritant, doormat or nanny. Yes, Mary Poppins has many fine qualities, but being likable isn’t one of them.Recently, we have been seeing a new wave of unlikable female protagonists. It kicked off with 2016’s highly isive Nocturnal Animals, starring Amy Adams as a character who was “not easily likable”, in the words of film critic Barry Wurst. And not everyone, it turns out, is a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite. Sure enough, reasons given include (and I didn’t have to dig deep for these examples) “Not liking any of the characters” “wholly unlikable female characters” and “everyone in this film is a varying shade of unlikable”.Yet I would contend that The Favourite’s three leading characters are likable – in small and volatile doses. None of them saves a cat, but we start off by automatically siding with Abigail (Emma Stone) because she is an underdog, and, from Oliver Twist to The Karate Kid to Harry Potter, we have learned to root for underdogs. Abigail’s likability is only confirmed when palace servants (with whom she is billeted) play a vile trick on her – we’re used to sympathising with victims. We are on safe ground here: Abigail is shaping up to be a traditional heroine. And we like her even more as she finds cunning ways to insinuate herself into the queen’s favours, because, from Elizabeth Bennett to Jo March to Hermione Granger, we are accustomed to siding with heroines who are clever.Yet that cleverness eventually curdles, until we are faced with the possibility that Abigail may not be so likable after all. Similarly, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) veers between likability (she seems genuinely fond of the Queen) and steely-eyed ambition – a quality perceived as anything but likable in a woman, as Clinton and Warren have discovered.Even Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), initially depicted as capricious, self-absorbed and ridiculous, is shown to have suffered devastating heartbreak – and just like that, we find ourselves liking her more. In the end, much of The Favourite’s deliciousness as an entertainment stems from our emotional allegiances being tugged this way and that by women who are not simply good or evil but flawed, multifaceted human beings. Just like real people.If you think Abigail, Anne and Sarah are unlikable, get a load of Erin Bell in Karyn Kusama’s Destroyer. Our first view of Bell is pink-rimmed bloodshot eyes squinting out of sun-damaged skin. She is a Los Angeles detective ravaged by alcohol, cigarettes and traumatic memories of an undercover assignment gone horribly wrong, and Nicole Kidman plays her with the sort of fearlessness (and help from makeup designer Bill Corso) that makes her Oscar-winning fake nose for The Hours look like a party trick. The days of Jane Fonda being able to pass as an alcoholic in The Morning After (1986) just by mussing her hair are long gone. “You look terrible,” says a colleague of Erin’s, and so she does. And Kidman’s transformation is more than just grandstanding – her ruined face reflects her character’s story.In Destroyer, Kidman sacrifices one of the strongest weapons in a film star’s arsenal – her good looks (deemed more essential for actresses than actors), and with it a shortcut to securing our sympathies. According to innumerable studies, including this 2011 Harvard-related one, we are conditioned to see beautiful people as more likable and for every Hunchback of Notre Dame or Small Soldiers (1998), making your good guys ugly still amounts to a subversive act. Still, we think, Bell may look like a wreck, but surely she will win us over with her caustic wit, or by saving a cat? Nope. The kindest thing she does is give a handjob to a terminally ill man, and even then it is not an act of charity but a peculiarly sordid way of wringing a name out of him.While Melissa McCarthy isn’t as conventionally glam as Kidman, she brushes up nicely for chatshows and red carpets. So it is a little disconcerting to see her in a dowdy wig and unflattering specs in Can You Ever Forgive Me? She plays the real-life writer Lee Israel, whose career had slumped so much by 1992 that she began to support herself by forging literary letters and selling them to dealers. Even before the opening credits are over, this prickly, self-pitying alcoholic has already told a work colleague to “fuck off”, and stolen an overcoat and two rolls of toilet paper at her agent’s party.While Israel doesn’t save a cat, she does share her apartment with one her criminal career is launched when the animal gets sick and she needs money to pay the vet. This definitely makes her more relatable, and it is hard not to sneakily admire her refusal to clean up her act and play the literary game (unlike Tom Clancy, whom she dismisses as a “jackass”). McCarthy makes us feel for her without softening her anti-social abrasiveness, but likable? Hell, no.Like Destroyer, Can You Ever Forgive Me? was directed by a woman – Marielle Heller. “Lee was flawed and complicated and fascinating,” Heller told Variety. “If she were a male character, nobody would bat an eye, but because she’s female, it feels radical.” The screenplay was co-written by Nicole Holofcener, while The Favourite was co-written by Deborah Davis. Many people say (see what I did there?) that one result of getting women’s voices out there, making more movies, means that audiences will get used to seeing female characters who are less likable, more human. And who knows? Maybe one day they will stop expecting female politicians to be likable, too.Destroyer is released on 25 January Can You Ever Forgive Me? on 1 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e4d30fd2eccb205475747c54d1c418b769bd84/163_195_4387_2633/master/4387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c109906b00e5c59a702e90178c64df","title":"mauricio pochettino should reject manchester united history spurs","story":"Why take on a rebuilding job in Manchester when he could win Tottenham the title for the first time in almost 60 years with a little help from the board?Mauricio Pochettino knows he is the most coveted manager in football right now. I can only describe his comments this week about his future at Tottenham as a direct call for action to the club’s board following his show of loyalty. I understood Pochettino to be saying to them: “I have showed and I am showing my loyalty to you by batting away the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United, but now if you back me financially I want to stay for the next 20 years”.Pochettino has been at Tottenham for five years, which is rare in modern football and yet has spent a lot less money than rivals clubs who challenge for the Premier League. Jürgen Klopp has turned Liverpool into real title contenders in only three years and has had to spend a lot of money to try to bridge the gap to Manchester City. But Klopp has also moulded that team in his own image, with an exciting brand of play which we have seen in abundance this season. Pochettino has done the same but how much of building a team to win the Premier League is down to having much more spending power versus a coach’s ability to change the playing style, tactical blueprint and perhaps most importantly the winning mentality of the team?Pochettino has been a revelation at Tottenham but the big challenge for him is to try and change the mentality of the club. I’ve said in other columns that Tottenham have been a nearly club for too long. Reaching eight semi-finals in as many years probably exemplifies that nearly status.Pochettino needs to try to mount the type of title push that Klopp and Liverpool are building while making sure they get over the line when it matters by starting to win trophies. However his call for action to “change the way we have done things in the last five years” is valid given the lack of spending by the board over the past few transfer windows. Tottenham need to become a winning team not just a great team with fantastic players. There are other managers who have built a winning team in less time than Pochettino.For now I think Pochettino will stay – I don’t think a manager comes out and says “I want to stay for 20 years” if he doesn’t want to and I applaud his loyalty when he would be forgiven for moving to, say, Real Madrid. But he knows he is in a more powerful position if he stays and shows his loyalty because now he has the power to ask for what he wants and do it directly. He is very smart.I’m not sure how much money will be available when Tottenham finally move into the new stadium but Arsenal struggled to compete for the Premier League for years when they moved to the Emirates.Tottenham were the first Premier League club ever not to buy anyone in the summer transfer window so to still be competing for the title is a real credit to Pochettino but I do not think Spurs can continue in this way. If the forthcoming transfer window is anything like the last one, it would be unfair to expect Tottenham to challenge while Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea continue to add key players to the team.Tottenham still need two world class full-backs and maybe another centre-back to make the next step. We have seen how crucial Virgil van Dijk has been to Liverpool. It is not always about signing star forwards and midfielders. Tottenham have as strong a front line in Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura as any other team in the league.Chelsea have changed managers a lot over the years and are spending a lot less these days but they have been fortunate to retain some of their best players at the same time, such as Eden Hazard. Maurizio Sarri is one of those managers who can get the best out of players who aren’t necessarily world class which he proved at Napoli. It goes back to managers having to work with what they have got versus those who just have a bottomless pit to spend like Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Pochettino has now reached the stage where he is thinking: ‘I’ve brought this team such a long way but how can we go further?’ Now it’s about how the board react in the summer and whether he is given the money to strengthen the team. I hope Pochettino is supported. His loyalty deserves it.I can’t see Tottenham winning the Premier League this season because they have been dropping too many points against teams lower in the table but now he has made it clear that he wants to stay, next season could be a real chance for them.If Pochettino doesn’t get the financial backing from the board, I’m sure he will make it known and put more pressure on them. He walked away from Southampton after building a successful team, which proves if the opportunity is right he is capable of leaving. But I would be shocked if he went to Manchester United at the end of the season if he is in the perfect position now to really up it with Tottenham.I’m sure United are already thinking about who will be their permanent manager after Ole Gunnar Solskjær and if they don’t know it’s Pochettino now then I don’t think it will happen. Maybe it’s mind games but I don’t think Pochettino is that kind of person: Tottenham is his project. There is more potential to do something historic at Spurs by winning the title for the first time in almost 60 years than going to United to try to rebuild the club. Now he is so close to getting over the line it would be such a shame to walk away. Why would you go to Real Madrid, where they change their manager every other year, or to United where the rebuilding job is huge? If I was Pochettino, I would stay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc44c14afdbec796026cc4f00aab09167801e6e7/0_195_2972_1783/master/2972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf8bec3660671ce42ec3d1b0d4a9a68","title":"nottingham forest manager aitor karanka leaves club","story":"• Forest in seventh place in Championship• Spaniard had been in charge for just over a yearAitor Karanka’s protracted exit from Nottingham Forest was finally confirmed on Friday morning.The 45-year-old Spaniard’s future at the City Ground had seemingly been uncertain ever since Forest blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Norwich on Boxing Day.Karanka has now left his role as manager after asking to be released from his contract, a request the Championship club agreed to.The first-team coach Simon Ireland will take charge until a new manager is appointed.A club statement read: “Aitor Karanka has asked to be released from his contract as the manager of Nottingham Forest Football Club.“The club have agreed to this request and the terms of departure have been agreed.

The Belgian midfielder was once a mandatory pick for Mauricio Pochettino but injuries have caught up with him and he has featured in only 10 league games this season. Dembélé’s decline has been a blow for Pochettino and Tottenham’s manager has also had to deal with injuries to Eric Dier and Victor Wanyama, forcing him to ask a lot from Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko in the past month. Sissoko and Winks have responded by forming an effective partnership in central midfield, enabling Tottenham to force their way into the title race, but they looked tired against Chelsea on Tuesday. Manchester United, who visit Wembley on Sunday, will spy a weakness to exploit given that Pochettino’s only alternative in recent weeks has been the inexperienced Oliver Skipp. Paul Pogba is probably licking his lips at the thought of stamping his authority all over midfield – assuming, of course, the United showman’s resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjær is the real deal. JSIf you want an idea as to why some Leicester fans are frustrated with their team and Claude Puel, then observe their infuriating inconsistency of late. Their past six games in all competitions have been: defeat on penalties to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup after making a number of changes to the team victory at Chelsea victory in the league over Manchester City defeat at home to Cardiff victory at Everton defeat to Newport in the FA Cup. Puel’s decision to make wholesale changes against Newport was more defensible than against City, with their opponents 13th in League Two. But now they are out of both cups and have only that big seventh place to fight for as Puel prepares to take on his former club Southampton on Saturday. That is where they are at the moment but they may not stay there if they continue to be so erratic. NMUnai Emery has an intriguing call to make when Arsenal visit West Ham on Saturday. Mesut Özil is back in training after shaking off the knee injury that has kept him out since Boxing Day, and in previous seasons the German would have expected to walk straight back into the starting lineup. Not in the post-Wenger era, though. Özil’s importance has dwindled, even though he still has the ability to unlock any defence with an eye-of-the-needle pass. The thinking is the team’s defensive structure is not strong enough to carry brittle iniduals and, although Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s foot injury means a creative spot needs filling, Arsenal also have to think about containing Marko Arnautovic and Felipe Anderson in West Ham’s attack. With that in mind, it could be a day for Alex Iwobi or Aaron Ramsey to provide extra thrust in midfield. Iwobi is in good form and Ramsey has knuckled down despite his impending move to Juventus both will have cause to feel aggrieved if they lose out to Özil. JSThe dismissal of Gary Rowett by Stoke this week called to mind another manager who is talking a good game but not getting the results to back up his words. Marco Silva is different to Rowett in that he does have trophies to his name, most prominently the Greek title with Olympiakos, but even that is worth putting in context: Olympiakos have been champions 10 times since the Superleague was formed in 2006, so he was not exactly dragging a team to success with his managerial brilliance. Troy Deeney recently rated Silva as the best coach he has worked with but that will not be much use with the words of the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, hanging in the air. “I look at the table and it is just not good enough,” said Moshiri, and while he also said the club will “stick with” Silva, things can change extremely quickly. Everton host Bournemouth on Sunday. NMHaving seen how Chelsea were frustrated by Southampton’s organisation in their previous league game, it is unlikely that Newcastle will be adventurous when they visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Rafael Benítez often uses a spoiling approach against the big sides and the Spaniard will surely tell his players to sit deep, absorb pressure and try to take advantage of Maurizio Sarri’s issues in attack. Chelsea drew another blank in their midweek defeat by Tottenham, despite dominating territory and possession, and it will not be in Newcastle’s interests to play an open game. Another game of patience will test Sarriball’s foundations. JSLiverpool could head to Brighton on Saturday with Virgil van Dijk as their only fit recognised central defender. With Joe Gomez and Joël Matip sidelined and Dejan Lovren not expected to recover from a thigh injury in time, Jürgen Klopp will likely turn to Fabinho. Chris Hughton’s side are unbeaten in four games and have proved a tough nut to crack at home – only Tottenham and Chelsea have beaten them there in the league this season. But the assured performance of the 16-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever in Liverpool’s FA Cup defeat at Molineux on Monday will have given Klopp food for thought, especially when watching him wriggle away from Hélder Costa and Rúben Neves before freeing Mohamed Salah on the counterattack. Klopp must choose whether to throw the Dutch teenager in at the deep end once more, or opt for a more experienced head. BFHuddersfield’s defeat by Bristol City in the FA Cup was the equivalent of a boxer’s shorts falling down after being beaten up for eight rounds, one last indignity after the previous pummelling. They have lost nine matches in a row, eight of those in the league, and while they have got some way to go before reaching the Premier League record (Sunderland’s 2002-03 run of 15 consecutive losses), they have definitely reached the stage where they are looking for any help they can get. In the run-up to Saturday’s away game at Cardiff, David Wagner said he has no idea whether they will be able to address their biggest problem by signing a striker, so they may have to look to another source for goals. Jason Puncheon has not scored this season but, at the very least, his arrival from Crystal Palace will add a little more dynamism to their attack. At this point, anything is worth a try. NMIt has been a tough journey to fitness for Tom Cleverley. An achilles problem kept him out of the Watford team for the best part of a year, but after a few substitute appearances he made his first start against Woking in the FA Cup last weekend. “It’s been a long hard year and a long road back,” he said. “It’s a big moment for me.” In some respects, Cleverley’s return could not be better timed, given the continuing uncertainty over Abdoulaye Doucouré, who this week offered the world’s politest “come and get me” plea to PSG. Central midfield is not an area of massive weakness for Watford, who visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, but if Doucouré does depart then Cleverley being an option again will at least mean they will not have to rush to find a replacement. NMPep Guardiola’s side have hammered in 16 goals in two matches and, regardless of opposition, those numbers are frightening. Wolves have an impressive record against the top six, appearing to raise their game when the big boys come to Molineux, having beaten Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham. But when Manchester City – who host them on Monday – are in the mood, especially at the Etihad, they are a different beast. Wolves should arrive with confidence and not total trepidation after upsetting Liverpool in the FA Cup but Nuno Espírito Santo’s side must again bring their A-game. Wolves, so comfortable without the ball, are solid but flexible in defence – they have conceded fewer goals than Manchester United and Arsenal – and given that City will want to dominate possession, they will have to show patience. BFIs it a coincidence that Burnley’s results have improved since Dwight McNeil broke into their first team? Maybe but the young winger has certainly added more of a spark to Sean Dyche’s side, who have won all three games he has started, two in the league and against Barnsley in the FA Cup. They host second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. “It’s not like we put him in for the sake of it, it’s because we think he can deliver performances, which he has done,” said Dyche. “I think we’ve timed our run well with that. It’s not just dropping somebody in, taking them out and you never see them again, it’s been building up slowly but surely.” As well as McNeil’s introduction, Tom Heaton has returned in goal, and praise must go to Dyche: neither decision was hasty but both are paying off nicely so far.

Firstly, he won’t be fit for Liverpool’s match at Brighton this weekend because his hamstring is still twanging. And secondly, he has been banned by Uefa for one international match for being a bit gobby on Instagram.Here’s the story from Reuters: Dejan Lovren has been banned for one international match over comments he made on social media about opponents Spain following his side’s 3-2 Nations League win in November. Lovren posted a video on Instagram where he appeared to brag about elbowing Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and made insulting comments about the Spain team following the game on March 15. He also told reporters after the match that Spain were “rude on the pitch” and bad losers. Uefa said that Lovren had fallen foul of a clause in its disciplinary rules which penalises anyone “whose conduct is insulting or otherwise violates the basic rule s of decent conduct.” He was suspended from Croatia’s next Uefa competition match, which is the Euro 2020 qualifiers at home to Azerbaijan in March. Despite the win, Croatia finished bottom of Group A4 after losing their final game to England and were relegated to League B of Uefa’s new competition. Ben Fisher has written this piece on Sheffield United captain Billy Sharp who, on New Year’s Day, scored his 220th league goal in 496 matches. That’s some record. Here’s the interview:It’s fair to say Neil Warnock finds the January transfer window bloody annoying. Actually, he finds everything bloody annoying. In his press conference to preview the Huddersfield game he said he doesn’t blame Nathaniel Clyne for joining Eddie Howe and Bournemouth ahead of Cardiff as he would have done the same. But he would have liked a phone call so that he could have had a few other irons in the fire. The latest players who look likely to slip from his grasp are Nice midfielder Adrien Tameze Marseille winger Clinton N’Jie. He came out with this zinger a few moments ago: The transfer window is like climbing a mountain with butter on your hands. One day you think you are there and then you slide back down. LLLLLLLLL. That’s Huddersfield’s sorry form, right there. They’re on a club-record run of nine consecutive defeats and face Cardiff on Saturday. With Manchester City following their trip to Wales, they need a result or that run will stretch to 11 losses by next weekend. But David Wagner says he doesn’t fear the sack. David Wagner does not fear for his job despite Huddersfield starting the new year rooted to the foot of the Premier League table.It’s not about fear, it’s about that I’m not happy, which is how I should be after all these results. It’s about how I feel responsibility. I like to put smiles on people’s faces like we have done over the last three years and a couple of months. I’m not able to deliver this and this is nothing that satisfies me and this is what I meant when I said I know and I feel the responsibility for it. I can’t ask for more support than I have had from the board, especially from Dean our chairman.” Huddersfield are right to back their manager aren’t they? No other manager in the Premier League could have got Huddersfield promoted as Wagner did. If they go down, which they probably will, they will have the best man in charge to attempt to get them back up.as they most probably will do, go down.They can’t score goals. that’s why the forward Jason Puncheon has joined on loan from Crystal Palace and is expected to make his debut against Cardiff. But Wagner refused to comment on speculation that Leicester have turned down a bid for striker Shinji Okazaki.Midfielders Aaron Mooy, Danny Williams (both knee) and Abdelhamid Sabiri (collarbone), plus defender Tommy Smith (hamstring) are still out.It is 10 years to the day since “the next Zidane” Yoann Gourcuff appeared to have the ball on a string as he scored this beautiful goal for Bordeaux in a 4-0 win over a PSG team that were yet to be fuelled by Qatari cash. Just look at his feet!“The next Zidane” is at Dijon now, where he has’t played a game all season. Guess, who’s back, back again? Paul Pogba, that’s who. He’s recovered from having Jonjo Shelvey’s studs introduced to the back of his leg and he is fit to face Spurs. The Frenchman missed last weekend’s FA Cup win over Reading but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes the midfielder is bang up for a return to United’s midfield at Wembley on Sunday.In other United injury news, Marcos Rojo has returned to his native Argentina as his injury is taking longer to heal than anticipated, while Chris Smalling (foot) is a doubt and Eric Bailly completes a three-match suspension.If you want some live football on a Friday morning (in the UK), look no further than Palestine v Australia in the Asian Cup. Our man Down Under, Jonathan Howcroft, is liveblogging it. The Socceroos lost their opener to Jordan, so it’s a crunch game for them. Where’s Scott Chipperfield when you need him? You can follow it here: Predicting what Leicester will do from week to week is nigh on impossible. They’re seventh in the Premier League, which is exactly where they should hope to be, but fans – and the Leicester hierarchy – do not appear overly enamoured with Puel’s style of football or the fluctuating results. They will be grateful to have a home game against Southampton this weekend who, despite having an upturn in fortunes since Ralph Hasenhüttl took charge, have no senior strikers available. Danny Ings and Michael Obafemi have hamstring problems, while Charlie Austin has been given a two-match suspension for flicking the V sign at Manchester City fans, which must have really, really hurt their feelings.Thomas Müller has been banned for both legs of Bayern Munich’s last-16 Champions League tie with Liverpool after doing a fine impression of Bruce Lee in a challenge with Ajax’s Nico Tagliafico. Funnily enough, he was shown a straight red card. Müller claimed he didn’t mean it. He may be right – but just look at the state of this picture: So who will be the next Nottingham Forest manager then? Here’s are the odds: Jokanovic is the clear favourite, and his recent experience of taking Fulham up to the Premier League last season is clearly the reason why. With Forest only four points off Derby in sixth, promotion is still very much on the table this season. But he turned down the chance to speak to Stoke about the job there this week – so might he not be ready to take on another challenge yet? Forest fans, who would you go for?The Premier League weekend kicks off on Saturday with a tasty London derby as Arsenal travel to West Ham. The Gunners are in much ruder health than their hosts, though. Arsenal manager Unai Emery has six players back in contention for the match. The Gunners can call on fit-again Mesut Özil (knee), Laurent Koscielny (back), Hector Bellerin (calf), Konstantinos Mavropanos (groin), Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal (both hamstring) if required at the London Stadium.As for West Ham, well Fabian Balbuena is the latest addition to Manuel Pellegrini’s lengthening long-term injury list. The Paraguayan defender resumed training this week after a knee problem but suffered a setback and has now undergone surgery which will rule him out for up to eight weeks. And will Marko Arnautovic play after his agent (who happens to be his brother) claimed the striker wants to move to China to “win titles”. Jack Wilshere, Manuel Lanzini, Carlos Sánchez, Andriy Yarmolenko, Winston Reid, Javier Hernández and Ryan Fredericks are all still injured, although the latter pair are due back in training next week.If you like John le Carré novels and Championship football then this story will be right up your street. Derbyshire police believe they may have helped Frank Lampard’s team in their efforts to beat league-leading Leeds by stopping a suspicious person (who may or may not have been reading a newspaper with two holes cut into it) from spying on a Derby training session. Here’s the Press Association story:Derby’s preparations for Friday night’s Sky Bet Championship showdown with Leeds were disrupted by a suspected spy. Police say they attended County’s training ground on Thursday after a man was seen at the perimeter fence of the Moor Farm complex.Derbyshire Police tweeted to say they had located and removed the man amid suspicion he was attempting to spy on Frank Lampard’s squad. The tweet from the Derby Response Unit of Derbyshire Constabulary read: “Officers have just attended the Training Ground for @dcfcofficial after a suspicious male was seen at the perimeter fence.“Excellent searching conducted and male was located. All checks above board! Keeping the team safe to bring home a win against #LUFC on 11th! #SpyingIsCheating.”The big match this weekend is undoubtedly Tottenham v Manchester United at Wembley, where Mauricio Pochettino will get to have a good look at the team he reportedly could inherit if he wants the job at Old Trafford. Ole Gunnar Solskjær can understand why the Spurs boss is being heavily linked with the United job – “The speculation is there for a reason, because he’s done well” – but could another resounding win for Spurs over United convince Pochettino that his long-term future still lies at White Hart Lane (if the stadium is ever finished, that is)? Our columnist Eni Aluko believes Pochettino should stay at Spurs and try to make history. Do you agree with her? One thing for certain is that United are a much more vibrant team than the Spurs side they thrashed 3-0 at Old Trafford in September, and it will be interesting to see how Solskjær’s rampant side – they have won five from five since he took charge – fair in their first real test since he took over. Is Willian off to Barcelona in exchange for Malcolm and some cash? Here’s the Rumour Mill on the latest attempt by the Spanish champions to prise the Brazilian away from Stamford Bridge: It’s Friday and another feastrudimentary meal of football awaits us this weekend.

Here’s the weekend’s fixtures in the English top flight:And there has been some breaking news in the Championship this morning, where Aitor Karanka, who has been under pressure for some time, has asked to be released from his contract at Nottingham Forest.

In October, the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expressed “serious concern” over a record number of deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians by anti-government elements in the country.“Despite such positive news globally, once again, IEDs are causing more civilian casualties than any other type of explosive weapon,” said Iain Overton, executive director of AOAV, a charity dedicated to reducing the impact of global armed violence.“Against a fall in civilian casualties globally, we are seeing a rise in some countries, notably Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Libya,” said Overton. “Afghanistan has a record number of civilian deaths in 2018.”Other countries where civilian casualties rose were Ethiopia, Gaza, Iran, the Philippines and Malaysia.The overall decrease in civilian casualties worldwide was largely due to the short-term defeat of Isis in Iraq and Syria, Overton said, as well as the decline of Boko Haram in Nigeria.Liam McDowall, a spokesperson for UNAWA, the agency in Afghanistan that provides details of civilian casualties to the security council, said its next report was due out in February. According to the latest UN figures, 8,050 civilians died or were wounded overall between January and September 2018. The use of suicide bombs and other IEDs by anti-government elements accounted for almost half the casualties. The UN expressed grave concern over the increase in direct targeting of civilians, including ethnic and religious minorities.McDowall, who said he could not comment on AOAV figures, confirmed that 2018 had brought a “record high” in civilian casualties in Afghanistan for the past four years. Before 2014, the majority of casualties were the result of ground engagement between Afghan forces and insurgents.“The UN is concerned about the deliberate targeting of civilians and the use of suicide IEDs,” said McDowall. “Over the course of last year, because of the very high profile attacks and insurgencies, IEDs have become the largest cause of deaths.”“While Syria remained the worst country impacted by explosive weapons last year, casualties decreased by a quarter in 2018,” Overton said. “This comes despite seeing the highest levels of civilian casualties from explosive violence in February and March 2018, when Syrian and Russian forces carried out an extensive bombardment of eastern Ghouta.”The AOAV report was compiled using data from sources including Airwars, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and reliable media sources."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b47c87878854e94e582100cab3997a82086680df/0_320_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5659caa44490963a5e2d0613fe22a41","title":"help to buy new build delay completion deposit","story":"I paid a £500 deposit on a new-build flat using the help-to-buy scheme.

Why did it fade away so quickly?When most Brits think of Asian music – if they do at all – they might conjure a twanging sitar and the high-pitched vocals of a Bollywood dance sequence blaring in an Indian restaurant, or the meditative chimes and chanting of a yoga session. In reality, of course, Asian music is a vast and erse series of musical disciplines, and one that had been reduced, in the UK, to the reserve of anoraks and first-generation immigrants. But in the 90s, a scene came along to change all of that.Twenty years ago, the Asian underground was born. A product of the first wave of Asian immigration into the UK in the early 60s and their children growing up in a newly ersifying society – one imbued with the racism of the National Front, as well as with a burgeoning multiculturalism from the Caribbean and west Africa – the music these first-generation British Asians made was full of internal tension. It was a mix of Indian classical instrumentals, Bollywood singing, jazz and the 90s club sounds of dub, drum’n’bass and jungle.British Asian music since may be best remembered for its most commercial moments – Panjabi MC’s 2002 hit Mundian to Bach Ke, R\u0026ampB poster-boy Jay Sean, and Cornershop’s No 1 Brimful of Asha, a reference to Bollywood singer Asha Bhosle. But the Asian underground encompassed a breadth of music on the fringes, as well as in the charts: there was the head-scratching mix of ragga, synths and Indian classical in the Asian Dub Foundation the sitar-electronica of Black Star Liner producer Bally Sagoo’s Bollywood remixes and the time-stretched drum’n’bass of Tabla Beat Science. It was Talvin Singh and Nitin Sawhney, though, who were its most critically acclaimed and experimental artists.Both producers released their seminal albums in 1999: Sawhney’s fourth record, Beyond Skin, and Singh’s debut OK. OK won the Mercury prize in 1999 and Beyond Skin was nominated the following year. The records are very different Sawhney’s incorporates vocal samples on his family’s migratory experience as well as jazz, Indian classical instrumentation and hip-hop, while Singh’s focuses on the dancefloor, stretching frenetic drum patterns over sub-bass and sitar.Both have gone on to longstanding careers as composers, yet the Asian underground movement quickly faded. “I always disliked the term Asian underground,” Sawhney says. “The whole idea of the movement was that cultural change could occur and that Asians would feel they have a relevance and identity within the wider culture – that’s what was exciting. Not this idea that we were underground, but that we were part of music.”Shabs Jobanputra, founder of the Outcaste record label that released Sawhney’s Beyond Skin, was one of the few record label executives championing this nascent scene in the early 1990s. “Outcaste started in 1994 because I wanted to see if I could form a movement to express my culture,” he says of its beginnings as a club night in west London. “Initially, it was hard to get people down to the club because it was something so different but by 1997, when we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Indian independence, 800 people turned up to our 200-capacity venue. We’d never seen anything like it.”One of the most exciting features of Outcaste as both a night and a label was this sense of difference. “The crowd was super-mixed,” Jobanputra says. “We had Asian kids who felt they could come along and be proud of their culture, inviting their white and black friends and whoever else along without apologising.”Coming to the UK in the 60s as a refugee from Idi Amin’s ethnic repression of the Indian minorities in Uganda, Jobanputra says he was “incredibly heartened by the reaction we got – being able to assimilate into this new culture, as well as being able to define my own sense of identity. It was a fantastic feeling to be a proud Asian person working in music.”While Jobanputra and Sawhney were hosting Outcaste, across town at Hoxton’s Blue Note was Talvin Singh’s Anokha. Where Outcaste explored the jazz- and funk-influenced fringes of the underground, Singh’s Anokha was more raw, inviting punk bands to play along with his tabla sets and incorporating high-energy jungle into the mix. British Asian composer Shammi Pithia says this form of nightlife was transformative for the community. “When I went to the nights, I saw Asian people in a different light,” he says. “Usually I would associate the community with family and being at home but there, people could do their own thing and enjoy themselves like anyone else. There was a sense that this music was for us and by us, and that was very powerful.”So why did that power fade? Jobanputra feels that the novelty of the movement’s difference wore off and the scene suffered. “It creatively ran out of steam,” he says. “I didn’t want to regurgitate the same ideas.” Instead, he now sees British Asian success in inidual acts making music, rather than a collaborative movement, having signed producer Naughty Boy in 2012 – who went on to record with Beyoncé – and developing grime act Koomz. “Subcultures are needed to foster a sense of identity,” he says, “but you can’t pin the Asian identity to things as easily now because the culture has moved on. The younger generation doesn’t have any inhibition they can be themselves without questioning. Whereas we needed something to rail against to bring us together.”Sawhney has more controversial opinions. “After 911, something shifted and I didn’t hear of Asian acts in the mainstream,” he says. “It felt like a segregation took place and maybe that’s because we were having a war on a country of brown people and that made the country far more intolerant of minorities.” Sawhney says record label A\u0026ampRs are less willing to gamble on acts now: “If I was to experiment like I was in the 90s now and tried to get signed, it would be bloody tough going.”But if we take Jobanputra’s more optimistic view, there may no longer be the need for a separate British Asian scene because integration is becoming more commonplace and acts can exist within the industry while embodying a new multiculturalism. Acts like pop-rap producer Steel Banglez references heritage in his name – the religious “steel bangle”, or kara, worn by Sikhs – but he makes music that is closer to grime and afrobeats than anything resembling the Asian underground. Similarly, rapper Premz, one of BBC Asian Network’s 2019 Future Sound winners, makes music that fuses Bollywood samples with UK hip-hop to create his own take on grime. “When we go into the studio, we don’t aim to make an Asian-sounding record,” he says, “but we’re now in a time where it’s OK to be proud of your culture, so it feels natural for me to incorporate that into my music.”Shammi Pithia, meanwhile, is emphatic that the underground has allowed for this embracing of marginalised identity. “Listening to Beyond Skin was revolutionary,” he says. “I realised I could mix genres in one song and I didn’t need to justify it. It’s probably the most important album I’ve ever heard since it made me realise that Indian music isn’t just for Indian people. It made me proud to be a British Asian musician.”Perhaps, then, the shedding of the “underground” tag is a good thing: a symptom of acceptance. “Now, British Asians aren’t just underground, they’re working in all fields,” Pithia says. “Talvin and Nitin’s albums set the pathway for the music to grow far above the underground – in a sense, ‘underground’ may have been an oppressive term.” Even Sawhney admits that “in the 90s I was making a strong point of integrating Indian classical music into everything I did deliberately, but nowadays I’m at the point where if I want to write music that has nothing to do with being Asian, I can do that also.”As such, he has been commissioned to create a new version of that most British song of all: the national anthem. “I’m travelling around the country and creating a multicultural anthem in response to Brexit,” he says. “We need to see Britain as a multicultural society now more than ever. So, I’ll use my heritage if I need to, since we can’t keep up a culture of exclusion – there needs to be representation across the whole of the mainstream.”• Nitin Sawhney’s Brexit – A Rational Anthem for a National Tantrum, is at the Barbican, on London, 23 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2874369c266ed3e107b37554709a719f975810d6/0_0_4651_2792/master/4651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd7a81a93d43c4d10cf73aefa25cffe","title":"martin scorsese bob dylan netflix documentary","story":"Netflix documentary will feature new interviews with the legendary songwriter about his celebrated mid-70s tourNetflix has announced that Martin Scorsese will direct a documentary about Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story will feature new on-camera interviews with the legendary songwriter.The streaming platform says the film “captures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year.” It is due later this year.Variety reports that the film will be less straightforward than Scorsese’s 2005 Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, which focused on the songwriter’s rise to fame, his move to New York and temporary retirement following a motorcycle accident in July 1966. “Scorsese provides the master vision,” wrote critic Roger Ebert on that film’s release, “and his factual footage unfolds with the narrative power of fiction.”The Rolling Thunder Revue was a freewheeling multi-artist caravan that began in October 1975 and concluded in May 1976. Artists including Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Mick Ronson, Bette Midler, Roger McGuinn, Emmylou Harris and Allen Ginsberg joined Dylan on the autumn leg of the tour, which is said to be the focus of Scorsese’s film. Dylan’s mother also appeared. Dylan frequently performed in white face paint.It is one of the most noteworthy tours in rock history: “The Rolling Thunder Revue shows remain some of the finest music Dylan ever made with a live band,” wrote critic Clinton Heylin in his 1991 Dylan biography Behind the Shades. In 2002, an official recording of the tour was released in Dylan’s Bootleg Series.Dylan engaged Sam Shepard as a screenwriter for a film about the tour, although the result was largely improvised. Released in 1978, Renaldo and Clara featured live footage, interviews and dramatised fictional portions about Dylan’s life. He was billed as Renaldo and his first wife, Sara Dylan, as Clara. It clocked in at almost four hours and was panned by critics.Scorsese’s film is not the only Dylan feature in the works. Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino has said he is directing a film based on Dylan’s 1975 album Blood on the Tracks, to be written by The Fisher King and The Bridges of Madison County screenwriter Richard LaGravenese.Dylan will perform a rare UK concert this summer, sharing the bill with Neil Young at London’s Hyde Park on 12 July. Scorsese’s next slated feature film is another Netflix production, The Irishman, about the mafia-union wars of the 70s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2db3c7019f69220542718534c443b0e834fee5fa/0_409_7060_4237/master/7060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0260b5db82249865b5de7df113aacf2f","title":"the 1975 review live belfast sse arena","story":"SSE Arena, BelfastBlurred genres, digital anxieties and giant iPhones… the 1975 strive for the zeitgeist as they open their new UK tourSinger Matt Healy is standing on a hydraulic lift at the back of the arena stage, rubbing his slicked-back, natural-coloured dark hair. Dressed down in athleisure and a V-neck top, he turns his back to the crowd and regards the massive screen behind his band, the 1975, with curiosity.The visuals on this first night of the band’s latest tour have been pretty impressive thus far. “Modernity has failed us,” runs a line from Love It If We Made It (played later in the set), a stark statement from the band’s persuasive third album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. But the 1975 do have some uses for the tech age. There is a lot of very shiny stagecraft deployed in tonight’s gig, bumping them up into the role of arena innovators.For Sincerity Is Scary, Healy unexpectedly re-enacts the song’s video in a pair of chunky headphones and a rabbit-eared hat. A vast hi-res projection of a New York brownstone behind him, Healy cavorts like Michael Jackson down a sneaky treadmill that runs the width of the front of the stage. The band – drummer and producer George Daniel, bassist and keyboard player Ross MacDonald, guitarist and keyboard player Adam Hann – play on, safely behind a row of lights.It’s hardly the most original of modern complaints, but the 1975 are credible emissaries from a land of surfaces and mistrust: they nail the ongoing experience of how our feelings are being manipulated by our technology more perceptively – and more tunefully – than most. Radiohead, for one, never had a pop banger as blithe as the 1975’s sweetly nagging TooTimeTooTimeTooTime, which considers infidelity while recalling Justin Bieber and Afro-swing.And they are unlikely to have deployed dancers. The 1975 have always occupied a grey area between pop and rock – indeed, their creation myth involves shrugging off such delineations and making funky 80s arena guitar tunes, against the advice of the entire music industry. Most of tonight’s show feels more like pop in part because of two dancers, the Jaiy twins – thoughtfully non-sexualised in white overalls – whose dance steps Healy ably mimics.It’s hard to conjure real cleverness out of large venues, where the tendency is to have people flying about for the sake of it. But this band, armed with such a heavy album, manage to pull off a deft conjuring trick or two.As Healy gazes up at the back wall during The Ballad of Me and My Brain, a track from their previous record, I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful, Yet So Unaware of It, the backdrop buzzes with TV static. As Healy touches the screen, it warps into dazzling colour.He then steps up, and into the static. From the side, it looks as though he has vanished. It is a moment that draws a collective gasp from the crowd: it’s not so much that Healy has broken the fourth wall, it’s that the fourth wall has eaten him.Swiftly, the projections shift and Healy is visible once more, standing on a shelf inside the backdrop for one more audacious reveal. The singer is framed to look as though he is inside an actual iPhone, the word “hello” in an Apple-like font above his head. It’s quite a cool feat: toying with depth perception, then making people take pictures of you with their phones, standing inside a phone.After this, the rest of the band’s set goes by in a blur of dazzling, hyper-lurid digital visuals, the trajectory slightly downhill. It’s not that the 1975 lack for momentum – they just fail to pull the rug out from under the crowd in quite the same way as before.Healy, too, is more of an enigmatic presence tonight than he has been previously. It might be a case of first-night concentration, or perhaps, a clearer head than in years gone by. Whatever: he prioritises not falling off the travelator, rather than enacting his previous brand of foppish dissolution, or saying a great deal between songs. You can hardly blame him – the last time he was loose-lipped, he had to issue a clarification of his views on misogyny in rock and hip-hop.When he came out as a recovering heroin user last summer, the internet did not exactly wilt from the shock. Few artists have gone about their business with as much gusto for rock’n’roll cliche as this 29-year-old.Tattooed, frequently shirtless, when younger, Healy channelled the brash sensuality of 80s stars like INXS’s Michael Hutchence while simultaneously raising a millennial eyebrow at the absurdity of it all tonight, he seems more contained, even as he gambols around.The jaded might wonder if smoking opiates was on some bucket list of poses for Healy. More compassionate observers might ponder the need for unquiet minds to self-medicate. Healy, for his part, has been candid in song and interviews about his insecurities and suicidal thoughts, which populate this album even more audibly than before.As a result, he has emerged as an articulate personality increasingly in tune with anxious times. Tonight, I Like America \u0026amp America Likes Me (named after a Joseph Beuys performance art piece where he spent three days in a room with a coyote) marks the height of over-stimulation – our collective overload, and Healy’s personal version. Layered with Auto-Tune, Healy sings about his fear of death while the track hits a kind of auditory and retina-singeing peak, tilting at Xanax-addled trap hip-hop.Having survived the age of 27 – when Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain died – the only rock cliches left for the 1975 to embrace are travelling in different tour buses and making a documentary about their group therapy, as Metallica once did.Certainly, the album they made around Healy’s stint in rehab in Barbados is a sprawling, genre-hopping mashup that reflects both our era of always-on excess, and Healy’s particular responses to his own internal cacophony. That such harrowing fare can be this refreshing live is a coup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dfb18c1b4ac2eda05e2413c62cddec04130eaa4/0_147_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e07e7d263ddf41f19e60c579e3f5fcf","title":"deal or no deal where next brexit today in focus podcast","story":"As Theresa May prepares for the showdown Brexit vote on Tuesday, the government is stepping up its contingency planning for crashing out of the EU without a deal. ’s Patrick Wintour sets out the routes available to the government as the exit date fast approaches.

It’s time to go back to the people, 9 January) pinpoints many issues as to why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, but then perversely creates the wrong solution to the clear and decisive voice of the British people.The dispossessed were given a voice as the sovereignty of parliament was transferred to its citizens via a referendum. The UK has respected every decision of every referendum in the past. Our remain top-heavy parliament is creating difficulties for itself the answer is to listen more carefully to the people and not to ask the people to speak more clearly.Your call for humility on behalf of those who failed to hear the people’s cry is not best displayed by not fulfilling the instructions of those very same people who we recognise have had enough. wants to see a reformed UK in a reformed EU, but it is evident that the EU is not for reforming other than to continue its repetitive march towards the United States of Europe that you say you do not want. The EU is simply not for turning away from closer integration on finances, foreign policy, defence structures and ever closer integration as it engineers the tools that in the end create our ultimate governance from a remote, undemocratic, elitist Brussels. It failed to heed the overtures from David Cameron in 2016, and it is on broadcast mode only as we try to negotiate our withdrawal from its institutions. too is on broadcast mode. We must respect our own tools of democracy, and simply because parliament is in contempt of the people is not sufficient reason to further enrage those who have spoken to ask for greater clarity on what they meant when they said “enough” of this project.Entrepreneur and international hotelier Rocco Forte, writing on the same day in another publication, writes lucidly about the strengths of the UK economy and its significant standing in the world. He is confident about the steps that need to be taken to deliver on the vote and our continued and expansive role with the rest of the world. He points out that the EU sold £341bn of goods to us last year and the leverage that our £95bn deficit with the EU gives us if only we used it.So instead of dressing up our disappointment in the result of the people’s vote of 2016, and pretending that failing to listen to its call is ultimately nothing other than Orwellian doublespeak, let us embrace the opportunities that have been offered by the boldness and astuteness of our ultimate bosses: the people. To deny them their Brexit would certainly be the worst of all worlds and would most certainly put us in uncharted waters – and the repercussions of that would be dire.Nigel Evans MPConservative, Ribble Valley• Your leader makes good points, but is once again based on the assertion, also maintained in the past by the Observer, that the referendum result was valid – “We accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won”. Thanks largely to the investigative reporting for which the Scott Trust is revered and supported, we know that a number of factors subverted the referendum. Several of these abuses were claimed, indeed claimed by the perpetrators themselves, to have swung the narrow result the fact that they did so when added together must now be almost certain. At the very least they render the result unsafe as a premise upon which to decide the fate of our nation.Surely the  and the Observer should change their stance on this vital issue in the light of the evidence to which they have themselves contributed with such distinction. Then we will have more hope that our elected representatives will change their stance as well.James WillisAlton, Hampshire• Your editorial on Brexit omits to mention a key factor that is used to argue against a second referendum – that to hold one would disrespect the democratic will of the people. Such a view ignores two glaringly obvious facts. One, the leave majority was extremely slim and therefore cannot be considered to represent a single “will of the people”. Two, democracy was gloriously disrespected by those who made promises that have turned out to be fanciful at best and blatant falsehoods at worst. Now that the people have seen enough evidence upon which to base their rational judgment, their democratic right to express it must be restored.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottinghamshire• Your leading article supports some mechanism such as that used recently in Ireland. This is potentially crucial for the future of this country in two particular ways. First, it addresses the basic question of who is fitted to guide our country’s policy, and brings in the principle of randomness. Random selection applies no filters: not gender, not race, not education, not class, not wealth, not family connection. It therefore is revolutionary in, at last, assuming equal citizenship. Who owns the country? All its citizenry.Second, the mechanism includes study of the issues. It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.Howard HiltonAudlem, Cheshire• Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) “The message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal” I believe that is true 2) “and that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.” I believe that is true 3) “The government has failed” I believe that is true 4) “… so we must go back to the people.” If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren’t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question “Can article 50 be revoked?” has been: “It’s not government policy”. Presumably that means “yes”. So, that’s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people’s vote in a general election.Celia WilsonDidcot, Oxfordshire• Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens’ assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That’s why I, and no doubt other  readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people’s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.Keith FlettLondon• The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it. It won’t be the first time parliament has ignored the so-called public will.Michael HeatonWarminster, Wiltshire• For once, a leading article that leads: thank you. You should give credit where it’s due by acknowledging that it was Gordon Brown who put the idea of a citizens’ assembly on the table in his November speech at the Institute for Government.Willy McCourtLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

Any complaints process has to be transparent, balanced, fair and confidential. That’s in the interests of the complainers and those complained about.”In August last year, he called for an investigation into what he has described as the leaking of information surrounding a confidential process.Regarding the referral to the ICO, a Scottish government spokeswoman said: “The Scottish government has never commented on the content of the allegations against Mr Salmond and we will not do so.“As a precaution, and in line with our legal obligations, we instructed a detailed review into our handling of Mr Salmond’s data in August 2018.“We are satisfied that information relating to this case has been processed in accordance with our legal and information handling obligations, and that there is no evidence of any data breach.“We are currently in the process of sharing this information with the information commissioner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945907cbd6dd43546e6214b878e5d721474b4b22/478_0_4994_2996/master/4994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7aeb301e2eed6ccec269d8e370b3fc4","title":"uk faces prospect of no brexit if may deal rejected says hunt","story":"Foreign secretary says vote against withdrawal agreement could lead to UK staying in EUA rejection of Theresa May’s deal could lead to “Brexit paralysis” and prevent the UK from leaving the EU at all, Jeremy Hunt has said.Such an outcome would be “enormously damaging” for politicians’ relationships with voters and Britain’s global reputation, the foreign secretary said.“If we were, as a political class, not to deliver Brexit that would be a fundamental breach of trust between the people and the politicians and I think that would be something that we would regret for many, many generations,” Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.He said if MPs voted down the deal the prime minister had negotiated with the European Union, it might not lead to a different type of departure, but rather a process by which Brexit might never happen.“If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit, but Brexit paralysis. And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit.Hunt insisted there was only one issue causing the deadlock over May’s deal and that was the backstop mechanism, designed to ensure there was no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland.He said the deadlock could be broken if the UK gained legally binding assurances from the EU that the backstop would be a temporary arrangement.“Theresa May has said she doesn’t just want words. She want something with legal force.”Hunt joined other senior Conservatives in criticising the Speaker, John Bercow, for allowing MPs to vote on Dominic Grieve’s Brexit amendment in what could ultimately change the course of Brexit.Bercow had been “willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity”, he said.Hunt was speaking after his cabinet colleague, Amber Rudd, said she was committed to ensuring the UK did not leave the EU without a deal.The work and pensions secretary declined three times to say whether she would remain a member of the government if it opted for a no-deal Brexit.Rudd was speaking as MPs prepared for the third day of debate in the House of Commons before the vote on the withdrawal agreement next Tuesday. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, will open proceedings, which are expected to be dominated by the issue of migration.Asked whether she believed the UK could thrive after a no-deal Brexit, Rudd said: “This is a strong and great country, we will find a way to succeed, but I do not think that no deal would be good for this country and I’m committed to making sure we find an alternative.”She said it was right for the government to make preparations for no deal, comparing it with wearing a seatbelt when driving a fast car.But, she said: “I intend to work with colleagues to make sure we avoid it. I am committed to getting the best outcome for this country, which is supporting the prime minister’s deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02d66033ec91b08037359a7e138d74e61e831c5/23_110_3655_2194/master/3655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f27afe021bef5c5afdde86603213cf64","title":"what is going on in brexit and what might happen next","story":"Your no-frills primer to the UK’s departure from the European UnionConfused by the latest developments in the UK’s fraught departure from the European Union? Here’s your no-frills primer to what’s going on in Brexit – and what might happen next.Two-and-a-half years and a fraught series of negotiations after the UK voted to leave the EU, the two parties finally managed to sign their two-part orce deal late last year.The first part of this is the 585-page withdrawal agreement covering the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British nationals on the continent, the sum Britain must pay the bloc for past commitments, and a mechanism (the “backstop”) to avoid customs and other border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The second part is a much shorter political declaration on the shape they would like their future trading relations to take, which is vaguely worded enough to allow for almost any outcome, from a close Norway-style relationship to a more distant free trade arrangement like the EU has signed with Canada.In theory, this whole package must now be approved by the British parliament so the necessary legislation can be passed to allow the UK to formally leave the EU as planned at the end of the two-year article 50 exit process on 29 March.Britain would then enter a 20-month transition period, during which nothing much will change and the future relationship will be negotiated, before finally stepping out into the big, wide world in December 2020 (or a bit later, depending on how long it takes to do the trade deal).Essentially because the withdrawal agreement – and particularly the backstop, which will come into force if the detailed terms of the future trading relationship do not manage to avoid that hard Irish border – does not have a majority in parliament.MPs in favour of Brexit fear it could leave Britain a perpetual Brussels “rule-taker”, potentially trapped in the EU’s regulatory orbit forever. Those opposed to Brexit say the deal risks leaving the country economically weakened, with no say in EU rule-making, and worse off all round than staying in the EU.The opposition Labour party rejects the deal, as do a large number of Conservative hardline Brexiters. The Democratic Unionist party, on which the government relies for its majority, also object, leaving the government facing a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.That is why Theresa May, the prime minister, pulled the Commons vote on the agreement that was planned pre-Christmas, rescheduling it for 15 January in the hope she could persuade the EU to come up with concessions or guarantees that would win her opponents (or enough of them) over.Good question. The EU hasn’t budged (it can’t, to any great extent: the agreement is legally binding, approved by 27 countries, and will not be reopened), and it is hard to see what supplementary assurances it could offer that would satisfy the Brexiters.Parliamentary resistance has not weakened, and the government has been reduced to trying to cut side-deals – in the form of amendments to the deal – with various different interest groups to try and peel off some of the objectors. Few observers think this tactic will work.In the meantime, the prime minister’s opponents in the Commons are waging a procedural guerilla war, tabling – and winning – amendments aimed at wresting more and more power over the process from the government and giving it to MPs instead, particularly if a no-deal Brexit looks likely.The problem is that while there is no clear majority for May’s deal, there is no clear majority for anything else either: not for a second referendum, nor a fresh election (Labour’s objective), or no deal (which almost all economist and business groups say would be a catastrophe), or a mooted “Norway-plus”, single-market style deal. And the clock is ticking.Assuming May is defeated on 15 January, many think it increasingly likely that the government may have to ask the EU27 for an extension to the two-year article 50 deadline to allow it – or more accurately, given the current mood, parliament – to look again at the existing deal, or try to develop an alternative Brexit approach it can agree on.Brexit, in other words, is far from over yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026a44ea38e32a0f9c95abd0d0cbb810fb020417/0_11_3085_1850/master/3085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=725264c15cb6f4f72f32bc709d18a6f8","title":"brexit latest news debate commons jeremy hunt claims commons votes this week have made staying in eu more likely p","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including day three of the Brexit debateSir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former defence minister, is speaking in the Brexit debate now. He starts by questioning Diane Abbott’s decision to raise the DearloveGuthrie letter. (See 10.15am and 10.26am.) He says he has looked into the claims very carefully and concluded that the letter is “not only incorrect but ... also inappropriate”. He says he deeply regrets the fact that it was written.He is now backing the deal. He says the public are getting fed up with this debate and want MPs to make a decision. He praises Theresa May’s deal as a clever compromise and he says if MPs reject it, “they will with absolute certainty be voting for chaos, with the outcome very likely the opposite of what they intended.”Abbott is still speaking, but the Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones intervenes to raise a point about the DearloveGuthrie letter. (See 10.15am.) He quotes this tweet from Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, saying the claims in their letter are wrong.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, also intervenes. He says he has a lot of respect for Sir Richard Dearlove and Lord Guthrie, but that their claims in this letter “are wrong”. He says there is nothing in the withdrawal agreement that affects the UK’s membership of Nato, or its security alliance with the US and its other “five eyes” partners. In response, Abbott does not defend the arguments in the letter fully, but she says that these issues are at least debatable and that the Brexit deal does not provide enough assurances. She also says that one of Labour’s six tests for the Brexit deal relates to security (“does it protect national security and our capacity to tackle cross-border crime?”). She says the deal fails this test, because it does not necessarily protect national security and maintain the UK’s ability to deal with cross-border crime.In the Commons Abbott has just raised this letter, from Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, and Lord Guthrie, the former head of the army, saying Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement would threaten national security.Abbott says Dearlove and Guthrie “know a lot more about security” than either Sajid Javid, the home secretary, or indeed herself.In the Commons Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is speaking now. She says that Labour wants to “honour the referendum vote”.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, has become the third cabinet minister in recent days to signal that she would resign rather than support a government implementing a no-deal Brexit.In an interview on the Today programme this morning Rudd said she was “committed” to ensuring the UK does not leave the EU without a deal. Asked whether she agreed with a previous claim from Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, that the UK could thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, she replied:This is a strong and great country, we will find a way to succeed, but I do not think that no deal would be good for this country and I’m committed to making sure we find an alternative.Rudd declined three times to say that she would remain in the government if it opted for a no-deal Brexit. On the final occasion, when Today’s Justin Webb asked if she would quit if Theresa May implemented a no-deal Brexit, Rudd cut him short by saying: “Thank you very much, Justin.” Yesterday Greg Clark, the business secretary, signalled that he would resign if the government opted for no deal. And David Gauke, the justice secretary, has also effectively said the same thing.Labour’s Mike Gapes intervenes. He asks Javid to admit that the claim by Vote Leave in the EU referendum, that 75m Turks could come to the UK if the UK stayed in the EU and Turkey joined, was wrong.Javid says it was wrong. He says people from Vote Leave have admitted as much.That seems to be a reference to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who has spoken about his reservations about this aspect of the Vote Leave campaign.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is opening the debate now.He says people voted in the referendum to take back control of immigration policy and to ensure immigration is reduced to sustainable levels. The policy announced in the immigration white paper at the end of last year will achieve that, he says.The Commons Brexit debate is about to start.But, first, there are a series of points of order. Labour MPs are complaining about the fact that Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is announcing changes to her policy on universal credit in a speech outside the Commons, not in a statement to MPs. John Bercow, the speaker, has just effectively reprimanded her, saying major policy changes should be announced to parliament first.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was on the Today programme this morning and he made an interesting assertion. The chances of Brexit being halted are going up, he claimed. Here are the key points.The parliamentary arithmetic is challenging. But, also, the choices are very clear. And I think after this week things have changed. Up till now I think people have quite rightly been worrying about the prospects of no deal. Now there is another possibility coming into sight, which is actually no Brexit.And why is that? We have a government that is committed to delivering Brexit. But it doesn’t have a majority. He also claimed that, if Brexit were halted, the consequences for democracy would be very severe.If this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis. And Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit. If we were, as a political class, not to deliver Brexit, that would be a fundamental breach of trust between the people and the politicians. I think that is something that we would regret for many, many generations.For many  readers, the claim that the odds on Britain staying in the EU are shortening may come as a welcome piece of good news. But it was fairly obvious that Hunt was not speaking with the intention of cheering remainers. Instead, he wants to scare Tory Brexiters into supporting May’s deal.This is not the first time the government has talked about the possibility of Brexit being halted. Theresa May explicitly raised this as one of three possible Brexit outcomes when she addressed the nation after the five-hour cabinet meeting that approved her Brexit plan. But she since she has been wary about repeating the claim, sometimes admitting that Brexit could be stopped and at other times declaring that the the UK will leave the EU on 29 March come what may. ITV’s Robert Peston suspects that she may not be happy with Hunt saying the choice is now just her deal or remain.And we have seen this week that there is a speaker who is willing to frustrate the government at every opportunity. He cited this as one reason why remaining in the EU has become more likely.I think it’s now looking much less likely that parliament would allow a no-deal outcome anyway. We have seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and to shape outcomes. I think parliament is very committed to try to stop no-deal, but I think we have to recognise that there is a deal on the table, it does broadly deliver the Brexit people voted for, and if we don’t find a way to get this through, we are taking some very big risks. This was another part of Hunt’s argument as to why Brexit being abandoned has become more likely. His claim is arguable, although not wholly persuasive. Although the Commons has flexed his muscles this week, it is still a mistake to think that, just because a majority of MPs oppose a no-deal Brexit, a no-deal Brexit cannot happen. I explained why in a lengthy post here towards the end of last year.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, opens day three of the Brexit debate. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, will close the debate at about 2pm.9.30am: Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, speaks at a convention on a second EU referendum. Other speakers include Dominic Grieve, the Conservative pro-European, and the singer Jarvis Cocker.10.15am: Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, gives a speech. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, she will announce a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

The first of these are believed to have been constructed in the 13th century, and many are found around the coast. It is thought the monuments represent ancestors and were linked to ritual activity, forming a focal point for communities, but the reason for their locations was previously a mystery. While studies have suggested the sites might have been chosen because of a link to key resources, the team says the latest research is the first attempt to scrutinise such claims.The team focused on the east of the island, where various resources have been well mapped, and looked at the distribution of 93 megalithic platforms constructed before European sailors turned up in the 18th century.After finding no link to the proximity of rock used for tools or for the monuments, they looked at whether the ahu were found near other important resources: gardens spread with stones in which crops like sweet potatoes were grown, sites linked to fishing, and sources of fresh water.Lipo said he became interested in the latter after he and his colleagues began delving into where those living on Rapa Nui got their drinking water from. The island has no permanent streams, and there is little evidence that residents relied on the island’s lakes.However, fresh water passes through the ground into aquifers, seeping into caves as well as emerging around the coast. “It is sort of amazing at low tide when the water goes down, suddenly there are streams running off at different spots right at the coast that are just pure fresh water,” said Lipo. “We noticed this, actually, when we were doing a survey on the island, that we would see horses drinking from the ocean.” Historical records reveal islanders drank this rather brackish water, while studies suggest they also made wells to capture drinking water.The results of the new research, published in the journal Plos One, reveal proximity to freshwater sites is the best explanation for the ahu locations – and explains why they crop up inland as well as on the coast.“The exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there – it is found through cave locations,” said Lipo, adding historic wells were found to explain some ahu locations apparently without fresh water. Lipo said the results chimed with the team’s experiences on the ground. “Every time we saw massive amounts of fresh water, we saw giant statues,” he said. “It was ridiculously predictable,” he added.The results, said Lipo, made sense, as drinking water is essential for communities and it is impractical to have to walk miles for a quick swig. “You would do stuff near the fresh water,” he said. But he says the study also adds weight to the idea that communities competed and interacted through monument building, in contrast to the idea that islanders engaged in lethal violence over scarce natural resources – something Lipo says there is little evidence for. Indeed, the team is now exploring whether various aspects of the statues such as their size or other features might be linked to the quality of the water resources, potentially offering a way in which a community could show off a competitive advantage to other groups of islanders.And community and cooperation, stresses Lipo, were crucial in construction of the monuments. “Anything that brings you together is going to make you stronger and allow you to survive,” he said. “I think that is the secret to Easter Island.”But not everyone agrees about the location of the statues. Jo Anne Val Tilburg, an Easter Island expert from the University of California, Los Angeles, said: “The existence of fresh water seeps near coastal ahu is well-known and was certainly important at European contact. However, such seeps are today, and probably always were, minor resources. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that these resources were of major importance in locating ahu during prehistory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a11988e8753bcf7d626184a6936d62898d0bd40e/0_34_1022_613/master/1022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597d98d834ddbb00a8d19a678ddc11fb","title":"alien theories natural after mysterious signals say scientists","story":"Fast radio bursts have caused more suspicion about extraterrestrial activityIn the 400 years since Galileo Galilei first held a telescope to the heavens, astronomers have laid bare some of the deepest mysteries of the cosmos. They have seen comets crash into planets, found oceans inside moons, and witnessed the shudder of spacetime as black holes collide.But space remains a realm of the unknown. Writing in the journal Nature on Thursday, scientists in Canada reported the detection of mysterious radio signals from halfway across the universe. It is only the second time that repeating fast radio bursts, or FRBs, have been spotted.Astronomers have yet to formulate a full theory of what produces these enigmatic, rapid-fire beams of electromagnetic waves. And in the absence of a firm explanation, speculation has fallen, perhaps inevitably, on alien civilisations. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has proposed that FRBs might be powerful energy beams used to propel alien spacecraft.It is not the first time that poorly-understood cosmic phenomena have been ascribed to industrious extraterrestrials. When in 2015 astronomers noticed a star, 1,500 light years distant, dimming and brightening, researchers suggested an “alien megastructure” might be revolving around it, and collecting energy for its constructors. Then, in 2017, the massive cigar-shaped ‘Oumuamua barrelled into the solar system, the first interstellar object known to do so, and prompted speculation that it was a tumbling spacecraft.Chris French, head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, said it was natural for humans to see aliens behind every cosmic mystery. “We have what is called an intentionality bias,” he said. “It’s the assumption that whenever something happens, something or someone made it happen for a reason. In the context of space, that someone is always going to be aliens.”The evolutionary argument for intentionality bias, or “agenticity”, is that our ancient ancestors fared better if a rustle in the bushes made them run for cover rather than assume it was the wind. “At the end of the day, our brains evolved to keep us alive rather than apprehend the truth of the universe,” said French.The late astronomer Carl Sagan spotted the dilemma for scientists. They can become cranks if they are too open-minded, but may miss out on landmark discoveries if they are not open-minded enough. “It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs,” he said. “The most sceptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas.”Duncan Lorimer, an astrophysicist at West Virginia University, discovered the first FRB in 2007. When his team spotted the radio burst, the possibility of it being a message from ET certainly came up. “We absolutely thought about aliens,” he said. “We only had the one object. We looked for patterns in the signal and couldn’t find anything, but we definitely considered it.”Now, mention of aliens is beginning to wear thin. “It helps to sell the story, but at this point I do roll my eyes a bit,” he said. Many astronomers now favour the idea that FRBs are intense beams of radiation shed by charged particles as they are whipped around by strongly magnetised neutron stars. “It seems like a more plausible idea, but I don’t want to rule out aliens completely,” he said. “I’ve been wrong before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c214b4bd79b2e7d955d7b4487d309c40e3b2bd2b/0_613_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553fd0b4e8076453d999ae63ca715ea5","title":"how to get your daily 30g of fibre","story":"A WHO report finds few people in the UK eat enough fibre.

The theoretical aim, for which there was general support across the political spectrum, was to simplify the system and increase the incentives for people to move off benefits into work.The project was legislated for in 2011 under the auspices of its most vocal champion, Iain Duncan Smith. The plan was to roll it out by 2017. However, a series of\u0026nbspmanagement failures, expensive\u0026nbspIT blunders and design faults\u0026nbsp means it is six years behind schedule and rollout will not be complete until 2023.The original design set out\u0026nbsp a\u0026nbspminimum 42-day wait for a first payment\u0026nbspto claimants when they moved to UC (in practice this is often up to 60 days). After sustained pressure, the government announced in the autumn 2017 budget that the wait would be reduced to 35 days from February 2018. This will partially mitigate the impact on many claimants of having no income for six weeks. The wait has led to\u0026nbsprent arrears and evictions, hunger (food banks in UC areas report\u0026nbspnotable increases in referrals), use of expensive credit and mental distress.\u0026nbspMinisters have expanded the availability of hardship loans (now repayable over a year) to help new claimants while they wait for payment. Housing benefit will now continue for an extra two weeks after the start of a UC claim. However, critics say the five-week wait is still too long and want it reduced to two or three weeks.Plenty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMultibillion-pound cuts to work allowances\u0026nbspimposed by the former chancellor George Osborne mean UC is far less generous than originally envisaged. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, about 2.5m low-income working households will be more than £1,000 a year worse off when they move to UC, reducing work incentives. Landlords are worried that the level of rent arrears accrued by tenants on UC could lead to a rise in evictions. It\u0027s also not very user-friendly: claimants complain the system is complex, unreliable and difficult to manage, particularly if you have no internet access. And there is concern that UC cannot deliver key promises: a critical study found it does not deliver savings, cannot prove it gets more people into work, and has plunged vulnerable claimants into hardship.“I’m absolutely convinced that universal credit is a far better system than the legacy system it replaces,” she said. “This is a really ambitious project. It’s going to impact on 8 million people’s lives when it is finally completed.“It is inevitable that, as we roll it out, as we make the changes, we are learning about how to do it better. Maybe things that were proposed previously weren’t effective or weren’t compassionate in the way that I want them to be. So I’m going to be perfectly bold about making those changes where I need to.”However, she added: “I’m not accepting that it wasn’t compassionate in the first place. It was. I’m just reinforcing that.”Rudd defended the benefits freeze, telling Sky News: “The whole point about the three-year benefit freeze was making sure that people on low incomes had the same rises as people on benefits.“This was a time when inflation was very low and it was the right thing to do at the time, given that we also had the massive debts that the country had inherited from Labour.”The work and pensions secretary added: “It was the right policy at the time, it’s got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off.” Pressed on when this might be, she said: “It has one more year to run … I do not expect that to be renewed at all.”A Labour source, reacting to the comments, said: “The Tories’ social security freeze reduced incomes every year for those most up against it, while they gave tax cuts to the rich and big businesses. Rudd is flat wrong when she says it was the right policy, which is why Labour is committed to ending it.”Rudd also announced a partial rollback to the two-child limit on universal credit payments as the Conservative government reformulates its welfare policy. In October last year, Theresa May said the decade-long period of austerity put in place by successive Tory-led governments would come to an end, though her claim was met with some scepticism.The benefits freeze was initially imposed for a two-year period and renewed in 2017 for three more years. Two separate pieces of research released since then by the Resolution Foundation suggested the worst-hit households would lose between £200 and £300 a year.The freeze affects benefits including tax credits, child benefit, jobseeker’s allowance, part of employment and support allowance and universal credit. In 2017, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicted it would drive almost half a million people into poverty by the time it came up for renewal in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af1d27bc77ffea38c10323099cc9d79fad23c69f/0_144_6120_3671/master/6120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ef928fdd83fbbcae3e2a4f2c69200f","title":"poppy bryony cleall saracens twins womens rugby union","story":"Poppy and Bryony Cleall have played together – and against each other – since the age of six and this weekend will be side by side in a top-of-the-table clashAs kids, Poppy and Bryony Cleall always sat back-to-back when they were unwrapping their birthday presents so they wouldn’t spoil the surprise if they were both given the same things. This stuff is always tricky for twins. Like the time Bryony got picked for England Under-18s but Poppy didn’t, or Poppy made the under-20s but Bryony was left out. Then there were the years they played for competing teams: Poppy was at Saracens while Bryony was at Bristol, and Poppy was at Bristol while Bryony was at Saracens. Just last week, when the RFU announced its first batch of permanent full-time contracts, Poppy got one but Bryony did not.Bryony is still in the England elite player squad, but will carry on in her day job as the head of girls’ PE at the Harris City Academy in Crystal Palace. “Poppy’s never even asked me if I’m OK about not getting a full-time contract,” Bryony teases. She is. She missed five years of her career because of injuries which is why she is a step behind her sister. Bryony has not played for England yet but Poppy made her debut in 2016 and now has 24 caps. “The email that told me I was in the elite player squad said at the bottom of it: ‘I know you may be disappointed by this’ but I was over the moon. I rang Poppy and I shouted: ‘Woohoo! I got in!’ I’m proud just to be involved.”The twins started playing when they were six. Their brother Josh used to play in an after-school rugby club, Poppy explains, “but Mum and Dad would come and pick us up all together at four o’clock so we had to wait around and watch until one day the coach said: ‘Do you two want to come and play?’ We’ve been at it ever since.”Sometimes they were playing with each other, sometimes against. Once they were on opposite sides in the Premiership semi-final. “Dad was like: ‘It’s OK, at least one Cleall will be in the final,’” Poppy says. Bryony cuts in: “Then she got injured and missed it anyway.”“Poppy will hate me for saying this,” Bryony says, “but my favourite story is the time she pulled my hair. It should have been a red card. I was with the ball and she went to tackle me and got a fistful of my hair. She let go and went: ‘Oh my God! I’m so sorry!’”Now they are back playing together at Saracens. This Saturday Sarries, the leaders of the Women’s Premier15 table, are playing Harlequins, who are second. Poppy is recovering from an injury but says she’ll be fit, if picked, for the latest round of what is becoming one of the league’s defining rivalries. “It extends beyond the pitch,” Bryony says. “Quins are definitely pushing women’s rugby to the forefront and so are Sarries. Both clubs want to be the number one draw in women’s rugby.”Lately the twins have been working together too. Poppy’s new contract means Bryony is going to have to find a new coach for Harris City’s under-18s team. Poppy took on the job when she moved back to London. But, as of 1 January, she is a full-time pro. “It’s such a privilege that we can be the first ever professionals,” Poppy says, “and it’s a little bit of pressure, too.” She has been a professional before, briefly, when the RFU gave the women full-time contracts before the last World Cup – but scrapped them when the tournament was over. “People just always ask me how come Poppy’s skinnier than me,” Bryony says, “and I always say it’s because she went professional four years ago.”Before that Poppy worked as a prison officer. “Anyone that can juggle a sporting career and a job, hats off,” she says, “because it was so stressful and some days it really did get me down.” She used up her holiday allowance taking time off to play games on the weekends. “I remember one weekend when our manager told me I had to play but I just couldn’t get it off work. In the end I told her I’d play so long as she didn’t put my name on the teamsheet. Lo and behold I scored a hat-trick, and on Monday morning my name was right there at the top. Two days later at work they were like: ‘You know when you rang in sick at the weekend? How do you explain this?”She felt like she was always letting somebody down, either her coaches or her bosses. It was always “sorry I can’t train because I’ve got work, or sorry I can’t work I’ve got to play”. Bryony is lucky as the school allows her some flexibility. But she is still painfully aware of the problems her playing career causes for her teaching colleagues.“It’s the work I leave behind, it’s really a burden for the department to have to pick up the load I’m missing.” For years, this was just the way it was if you were a woman who wanted to play international rugby. “You just put your head down and get on with it,” Poppy says. “Everyone’s got to make the sacrifices.”It should not be that way. And now, at last, it is not. “The women’s game has taken a big step in the right direction,” Bryony says. “I would have loved to have that first professional contract but I think it’s really more important for kids who are six years old now who can pick up a ball and think ‘actually, I want to be professional’ not ‘I want to play rugby and do some other job for a living’ but ‘my dream is to be a professional rugby player’.” Poppy agrees: “That’s the history that’s being written now, we’re living a dream that all the little girls who come after us can have from the start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b753d177baaca080670991f687945d1f7e8f4f28/0_28_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c178129cada960da7786e7a54a15b9f8","title":"andy murray british tennis hails arguably nations best sportsman ever","story":"The Scot can look back on a career littered with gold and cruelly bloodied by the slings and arrows of lifeIt is a poignant oddity that Andy Murray’s tennis career is ending as it began: in pain, struggle and confusion. When the thin, hairy teenager from Dunblane joined the full Tour in 2005 as the reigning 2004 US Open boys champion, he was No 407 in the world, but spent the first three months coping with a back injury that had cut him down in South Africa because, as he described it at the time, “I was growing a lot”.And how he grew. On the eve of what might well be his last match, four months shy of his 32nd birthday after tumbling to 230 in the rankings, Murray can look back on a career littered with gold and cruelly bloodied by the slings and arrows of life.His right hip, never reliable, has finally given up on him. His spirit is drained too. He is tired, finally, of the struggle. He survived back surgery towards the end of 2013 but, a year on from having his aching hip patched up by a Melbourne surgeon to help him eke out a few more moments in the sun, there is nothing left to give, nowhere else to go. To see him reveal on Friday that he could barely put on his shoes and socks without wincing was to witness a warrior laying down his shield.I watched that boys’ final at Flushing Meadows 15 years ago. Murray, under-powered but immensely gifted, was as passionate and determined on the court in beating the cerebral Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky as he was introverted away from it. It would be eight years before he returned to New York to win his first major, by which time he had acquired the bearing of a feared and confident champion, a fully grown man who knew his own worth.They were one and the same, of course. The essential Murray has not changed. There is a palpable decency about him, which several of his many friends mentioned when they learned of his impending farewell on Friday.He was and remains the owner of a particularly Scottish sense of humour – not as theatrical as, say, Billy Connolly, nor as earthy as Rab C Nesbitt. Maybe somewhere in between. He delighted in the engineered misfortune of his team members, all of whom have remained fiercely loyal to him – and not just because he was paying the cheques. Their respect for him as an athlete was deep, as it was among his peers.Dan Evans and Murray didn’t always see eye to eye but there was warmth there too, especially as Davis Cup teammates. “It’s desperately sad that his career’s had to end because of injury and not so much on his own terms,” Evans said after qualifying for the Australian Open on Friday. “But he’s had an unbelievable career, and he’s probably one of the best sportsmen Britain’s ever had, if not the best.”Kyle Edmund, who first met him when he was 14 and treasured invites to Murray’s Miami winter training camps, agreed. “He’s been my biggest role model. He’s Britain’s greatest tennis player ever, and you could say maybe Britain’s best sportsman ever.”Athletes don’t always enjoy talking about other athletes. It can be a self-centred existence. But the compliments flowed like honey.“Just to see his dreams come true and give hope to others and inspire myself as well as many others is just astonishing,” Katie Boulter said. “When I cracked the top-100 he messaged me and was very sweet and supportive. I think he’s been that for a lot of people, and every single person I know appreciates that.”Murray touched people in different ways. Heather Watson, who was a little miffed he chose to play Olympic mixed doubles with Laura Robson in London in 2012 rather than with her, recalls: “When he won Wimbledon for the first time, I was watching it in San Diego. When he started crying, I just started bawling my eyes out.”Johanna Konta put it succinctly: “He maximised everything that he has, to bring the best out of himself. Not many people can say that. That’s something, as an athlete, to look up to. It makes me quite emotional, because that’s a beautiful thing.”It didn’t always look beautiful. Murray lacked the smooth grace of Roger Federer (who doesn’t?), Novak Djokovic was more startlingly elastic a retriever of impossible “gets”, perhaps. Stan Wawrinka had more raw power, and Rafael Nadal could out-hustle him (as well as everyone else). But none of them had a bigger heart than the Scot.What most of us will remember about him on court was his extraordinary will to overcome, to repeatedly, perversely rise from the depths, leaving his opponent bewildered. The look on Djokovic’s face as Murray, close to cracking in the third set before steadying his nerves to serve out for victory in their 2013 Wimbledon final, was one of a man who’d had his pants pulled down in public.Murray could be maddening too. As he chased down the angels, his temper shortened. He sulked on a planet of his own. He had as fruity a vocabulary as any Glaswegian docker. But it was all genuine. In the many years I have been privileged to chronicle his deeds, I can’t remember him telling a lie. Perhaps in retirement he will set me straight.Above all, Murray should be remembered for what he did best: to drain the last drop of his talent in pursuit of victory. So completely did he use his reserves in the concluding months of the 2016 season to unseat the faltering Djokovic at the top of the rankings that his body screamed for him to cease. On 10 July, he won his second Wimbledon – and went out drinking with (among others) a few of the tennis writers he had previously kept at a respectable distance. He rates that day as among his favourite experiences.However, when the fun stopped, he got down to business and pushed himself to the outer limits of his physical and mental endurance. He won match after match, tournament upon tournament. He was irresistible. As Djokovic fell to pieces, Murray got to the top of the mountain and briefly stayed there, but the descent was inevitable once the adrenalin faded. His body began to give up on him and, from then until now, his has been a familiar fight against the odds.There will be no more gambling, though. On Monday, he expects to lose against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the tournament he has entered 13 times now, reaching the final five times, and losing each one – to Djokovic on four occasions, and once against Federer. He will strain every muscle to prove himself wrong one last time. The Spaniard, a decent man, will not have a friend in the house."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb","title":"the ultimate vegan friday night feast","story":"You’ve made it through the week, and now you want to celebrate with some good food. Vegan Miranda Larbi shares her tips for creating an indulgent Veganuary feastThere really is nothing quite as wonderful as logging off at 5pm on a Friday knowing that you’ve got no plans or dates with anyone except your sofa and Netflix.Back in the day, you may have thought that anything short of spending Saturday with a banging hangover was an abject failure but, in these busy times of hyper-connectivity, having a little down time during peak socialising hours can be seen as the ultimate luxury.And it’s especially welcome if you’re taking part in Veganuary. After all, the best way to kick a habit is to simply not engage. So rather than dining out and being tempted by a plate of ribs or raclette, you’re much better off staying in with a truckload of vegan treats.For me, that tends to involve a three-course feast of simple but delicious goodies.First up, non-dairy cheese (just because you’re a vegan, it doesn’t mean you can’t still have a cheese-fest).Cicioni cheese is incredible. It’s made from cashews, almonds, salt and water and tastes like goat’s cheese. Slice some up, stick it on a plate of Kallo rice cakes with some spicy chutney on top and you’re golden.And if that’s not enough cheese for you, there are always more options.A classic wintry pass-the-elasticated-joggers dish is mac and cheese, and I have a vegan version that will send you into the most glorious of carb comas. My recipe is both delicious and nutritious. It’s rich in vitamin B12 (notoriously hard to get from a plant-based diet) and has good fats. Here’s what you’ll need …Mac and cheeseSoak your cashews for a couple of hours (I tend to leave them soaking when I go to work) and, once swollen, throw into your food processor along with a glug of olive oil, a pinch of salt, the lemon juice, garlic and a generous dose of the nutritional yeast. The more yeast, the stronger the cheese flavour.Next, cook your pasta.In a separate pan, fry your onion and garlic before adding your chopped chestnut mushrooms and kale. Give the mushrooms a chance to brown a little and then once they look done, add your torn-up spinach and mix into your drained pasta. Drench in the sauce and sprinkle extra yeast on top. If you have any of the Cicioni cheese left, crumble some over.Obviously it’s not an indulgent night in without pudding …Nothing beats a tub of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s to kick back with on a Friday night. Vegan Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is the only plant-based ice-cream I’ve tried that tastes as decadent as the dairy version – in fact, I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference.Want to make it even more indulgent? Then I suggest throwing a packet of Livia’s Kitchen Nugglets Raw Cookie Dough into the mix (this is especially good with Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice-cream).Livia has some fantastically simple recipes (all vegan, gluten-free) on its website that are worth giving a go. I made an indulgent chocolate pie a couple of weekends ago, which was perfection personified with a dollop of ice-cream on top.

Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c72d5042cf63ee2c720d714238911f247a7e26/0_373_5597_3358/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b8aac52d5ac3a0c96c1d44a7f8009e","title":"the ultimate vegan baked alaska recipe","story":"This indulgent, retro dessert just got a vegan makeover, thanks to non-dairy ice-cream and aquafaba meringueServes 8Prep: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus 4-5 hours for freezingCook: 25-30 minutesFor the cake:125g dairy-free baking spread150ml dairy-free milk2 tsp white wine vinegar125g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract175g self-raising flour1 tsp baking powderFor the filling:500ml tub Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s non-dairy ice-cream3 tbsp jamFor the meringue:1 x 400g can chickpeas1⁄4 tsp xanthan gum1⁄4 tsp cream of tartar1 tsp vanilla extract100g caster sugarPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4.

Having everything that was good about Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant squeezed into a smaller package half the price of the bigger Echo, it was a no-brainer.But now the Echo Dot has some stiff competition from Google, in the form of the £50 Home Mini and its Assistant, and Amazon’s own second-generation Echo, which is now only £90.The Echo Dot is Amazon’s small, puck-like smart speaker with the firm’s Alexa voice assistant built in. New for the third generation is a softer, more rounded aesthetic with fabric sides. It is also slightly larger in all directions, measuring 99mm in diameter and 43mm tall.At the back is a circular power socket, replacing the microUSB socket of the old Dot, and a standard 3.5mm analogue socket for connecting to a stereo. On top you have the volume buttons, action button and the microphone mute button.You can also use Bluetooth to stream from the Dot to other speakers or from your phone or other device to the Dot to use it as Bluetooth speaker.The updated design is joined by an improved speaker. The sound is fired out from the fabric sides of the new Dot, instead of the plastic top of the old model, projecting sound further into the room making it much better for music.The quality of the speaker has also been upgraded. It won’t beat larger speakers, but for the money it sounds pretty good, edging out Google’s Home Mini.The mids are punchy, the highs relatively crisp and while there’s no real bass to speak of, the new Dot sounds relatively rounded for a small speaker.Feed it guitars and vocals from something like the live version of Hotel California by the Eagles from Hell Freezes Over and you’re greeted with a warm, inviting tone. Classical tracks such as Jupiter from Holst’s the Planets sound fairly rounded too. The Dot struggles with bass-driven electronica, but coped better than expected with Dr Dre’s Still D.R.E. despite its pumping bassline.The Dot can also get pretty loud, although not quite as loud as Google’s Home Mini, and the audio starts to distort in high-energy tracks at maximum volume.With smart speakers, the hardware you buy is only half the story: they live or die by the capability of the voice assistant within them.The Dot’s Alexa performance is first rate, with its four-microphone array being able to hear you over things like the cooker hood going full pelt in the kitchen or when playing music at maximum volume even if you do have to shout a bit. Alexa also sounds good through the Dot’s speakers.But where Alexa was the only game in town, it’s now a two-horse race between Alexa and Google Assistant. For most things Alexa and Assistant are on a level playing field, particularly if you’re not entirely integrated into Google’s ecosystem already.Smart home control, music playback, podcasts, news briefings, playing radio stations, setting multiple alarms, timers and various other little bits like that all work great.Alexa has a lot of third-party “skills” (apps), including those from news publishers such as the , games such as Escape the Room, utilities such as National Rail app and silly things such Star Trek – Red Alert, so you can pretend you’re on the starship Enterprise.You can change Alexa’s wake word too, which is the word it listens out for when dormant before activating. “Alexa” is the default, but options include Echo, Computer or Amazon - helpful if you have anyone called Alex in your house and want to avoid accidental activations of either the Dot or the human.Where Google’s Assistant has the edge is in interpreting speech when you mess up your questions, or when you issue multiple commands at once such as “turn off the Christmas tree and the living room lights”. Google can also answer a greater range of questions than Alexa.The new Echo Dot is a slight improvement over the old one in every way. It’s more attractive, sounds better, hears you just as well, still has a 3.5mm socket and Bluetooth audio in and out.It isn’t a patch on the larger Echo speakers, which are almost twice the price, but just about beats its closest rival, the Google Home Mini, on sound and connectivity.At £50, or frequently £30 on deals, you get a lot of smart speaker for the money with the Echo Dot. But where the original Echo Dot was a no-brainer, the decision now comes down to whether you want Alexa or Google Assistant in your tiny smart speaker, which is a much tougher call to make.Pros: can always hear you, small but loud enough, great device support, clear when muted, activity can been seen from across the room, Bluetooth, 3.5mm audio socketCons: music distorts at max volume, no real bass, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

At our peak, we were highly successful I had a team of 35 people, a £3m turnover and a Covent Garden office. When the agency folded, I decided to invest in bitcoin.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a type of electronic cash that allows people to spend or trade via a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of banks or other intermediaries. It is a cheap, efficient way of transferring funds or holding value, which can be converted back into sterling at any time. I had used it before to buy treatment online for my mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. I had also dabbled with investing in it in 2013, and made and lost some money: bitcoin is prone to sudden fluctuations in value. But the market seemed to have moved on, and I decided it could be a good way to make some profit on my savings.At first I deposited £5,000 at the time, January 2017, bitcoins were about $600, so I bought seven or eight and spent the rest on other cryptocurrencies. But over the next few weeks I became hooked and ploughed in a large chunk of money – £23,000 in all. I remember telling people, “I really think the value of bitcoin could rise to $2,000 this year.” I could never have predicted it would peak at 10 times that. By the middle of spring 2017, my investment had risen to about $300,000, and by the summer it was at half a million. Media interest in bitcoin was growing and friends kept asking how they could get into it, so I started a Facebook group, then a website and finally a podcast devoted to the subject. As excitement built, more and more people got involved, forming the conditions for a bubble but many of us were too caught up in the hype to exercise caution.At the end of 2017, bitcoin had reached almost $20,000 and my portfolio had ballooned to about $1.2m. That is when I got a little out of control. I have always been an entrepreneur, and since I was a kid I had dreamed of buying my local football club, Bedford Town, becoming chairman and getting them into the league. I thought the project might cost £5m, so that was the figure I decided to aim for. I estimated I could get there within six months.By this time I was travelling the world doing interviews for my podcast, taking friends out to expensive restaurants and buying extravagant gifts for my family. I am not the kind of person who puts everything away for the future, and though I donated £6,000 to my local hospital, much of my spending was quite frivolous. It might have been more sensible to buy a couple of houses, but I became overambitious. This felt like my one shot at achieving that childhood dream.At the end of January 2018 the bubble burst and bitcoin’s value suddenly fell. There had been a few drops during 2017 but it had bounced back, so I was not too worried. But over the rest of the year, I watched it sink lower and lower, along with the other cryptocurrencies I had invested in, all the time thinking, “Well, there’s no point selling now…” That was my attitude throughout last year, as bitcoin’s value continued to fall. Pretty much everything I had built up was wiped out.There are many who invested a lot more than I did and ended up with far greater losses. I wish I had taken everything out before the bubble burst, but I do not waste too much time on regret. I have earned money in the past through hard work and enjoyed it more. At the moment, I am enjoying making my podcast, which provides more than enough money to live on. I have sold most of my bitcoin, which is currently worth about $4,000 apiece, to give me a cushion in case the business has a bad month. But if I had to choose between the $1.2m and the podcast, I would let the money go again – I love what I do now.I still believe that bitcoin is a force for good. I recently interviewed Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, who was explaining how it helps people living in authoritarian regimes to prosper – for example, women in Afghanistan who are not allowed to open bank accounts can still work and get paid in bitcoin. It is a step in the right direction. My main focus now is exploring how bitcoin could help stabilise an increasingly volatile world.• As told to Chris Broughton.

By combining technology with the expertise of our fact-checking partners, we’re working continuously to reduce the spread of misinformation on our platform.”Since its launch in the US, Facebook’s fact-checking programme has received mixed reviews. It has been praised for trying to tackle the spread of misinformation on the platform, and particularly for its decision to give fact-checkers’ findings real weight in its algorithmic promotion. However, it has been criticised for its unwillingness to pay for fact-checking, which relies on users to flag content to third parties, who then check the veracity of factual claims. More general concerns have also been raised about the effectiveness of the programme: the worst falsehoods often propagate faster than fact-checkers can keep up, and increasing evidence suggests the labelling aspect of the fact-checking – as opposed to the algorithmic tweaks – can serve to promote, rather than suppress, false claims, as readers take the label as proof of a partisan effort at censorship.Facebook has also faced criticism over its choice of fact-checking partners in the US, supplementing neutral authorities, such as Snopes and the Associated Press, with partisan outlets, such as the conservative publication Weekly Standard, leading to conflicts about the truthfulness of fact checks.In the UK, Full Fact will initially be the sole fact-checking partner. Will Moy, the charity’s director, welcomed Facebook’s decision, saying: “Fact-checking can take hours, days or weeks, so nobody has time to properly check everything they see online. But it’s important somebody’s doing it because online misinformation, at its worst, can seriously damage people’s safety or health.“There’s no magic pill to instantly cure the problem, but this is a step in the right direction. It will let us give Facebook users the information they need to scrutinise false or misleading stories themselves and hopefully limit their spread – without stopping them sharing anything they want to.”A study published in the journal Science recently revealed that Facebook users aged over 65 shared more than seven times as much fake news content as users aged between 18 and 29."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ed7c3780560d452da6159acd2688f2867a3590/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d89c54a42b82e756001f6a922cc1d7","title":"the internet but not as we know it life online in china russia cuba and india","story":"Scroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueScroll to continueIn Cuba, internet access is limited. But if you can’t get to the internet, there are ways of bringing it physically to you.It’s known as “el paquete semanal” or “the weekly packet”, an external drive loaded with thousands of hours of media content that is delivered to customers by enterprising ‘suppliers’ like Alberto Jorge.“With el paquete you choose what to watch and when to watch it,” says Jorge, 34, as he walks the cracked paving slabs of west Havana delivering the drives.This week’s edition features showbiz news from Spain, Big Brother from the US, and an episode of Celebrity Masterchef broadcast just days earlier on BBC One.Alberto hands a one-terabyte drive to each household to copy, before returning the next day to collect it. He charges the equivalent of two US dollars a week for the service.Upon connecting the hard disk, subscribers are presented with more than 50 folders. There are Spanish-language editions of magazines such as Forbes and GQ, scanned in pdf format, apps that users can copy to their phones, and a file giving offline access to “Revolico”, the island’s main classified website which is intermittently blocked online.While tolerated by the authorities, it is unclear who heads up this hazy enterprise. Rumour has it that a network of entrepreneurs pay database administrators to download content using fast internet connections in their state jobs.On the other side of Havana, Elena Llera, 52, plugs a memory stick with The Bride of Istanbul, a Turkish soap opera, into her television. El paquete is now her main source of home entertainment, and she only switches to state TV for the evening news.Despite having a public wifi park just 100 metres from her apartment – one of more than 700 to have opened since 2015 – she connects only twice a week to video call her aunt in Miami. It costs the equivalent of one dollar an hour to use the internet, around the same as a day’s wage.“If I could, then I’d use the internet for all its functions, to learn about politics and culture. But I can’t. It’s very expensive,” she says.Alejandro Pol, 28, a dentist visiting Elena’s flatmate, uses el paquete to watch Vice News and reviews of the latest iPhones.“We know it doesn’t work like this in the capitalist world,” he says, “but it’s a way we have of staying connected.” For the first time in history, more than half of the world\u0027s population is online. But this source of information is not the same for everyone. When you consider the ways the internet shapes the way we see the world how it affects our idea of reality, these differences are more than digital window dressing — they have the power to influence what we think is true. These illustrations are intended to show how the experience of being online can vary from country to country. They are just a handful of examples.

Trailing his series This Week, which has to wait to get on air until Bruce’s show is over at 11.45pm, Neil concluded a metaphor about traffic jams with the words, “Honk if you hate Question Time,” an apparent resumption of the bad blood between the Thursday night rivals, for which Neil has been ticked off by BBC bosses in the past.Bruce’s opening link, in which she declared “it’s lovely to be here!”, like a mayor opening a garden party, raised fears that she was going to soften the show. But her follow-up questions to the three politician panellists - James Cleverly for the government, Emily Thornberry for the opposition, and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson - were as brisk and persistent as Dimbleby’s.Bruce could do nothing, though, about the fact that it was a case of new year, new presenter, but same old format and subject matter.The only sign of a tweak to the usual proceedings was that Bruce seemed slightly keener to include the people. “Let’s hear from the audience!” made an early bid to become her catchphrase, those interludes introduced by a firm “Wait a minute!” to the panellists. And wearing distinctive clothing seems to be the trick to catching her eye. She called on “the man in the hat”, and members of the public wearing a yellow scarf and jacket respectively. She was so keen to be inclusive that her pen, waving invitingly at the audience, often intruded in the corner of the shot.But, if the public is going to be more involved in the discussion, there surely need to be fewer than five panellists. Comedian Nish Kumar spent the first 22 minutes draining his water glass, before being invited to make the first of only three contributions in the hour. The other non-Westminster presence – journalist Melanie Phillips – was also called on so rarely that the camera caught her at one point with her head in her hands on the desk.Too many guests faced too few topics. One consequence of Theresa May delaying the Commons Brexit vote from early December was that Bruce was stuck with exactly the same questions as Dimbleby had fielded in his farewell show: Could the PM win and was there a plan B if she didn’t? Kumar lamented that, on his three Question Time appearances in the last year, the questions had been the same each time: “I’m stuck in an endless loop!”The fate of May’s deal occupied 40 of the available 60 minutes, leaving time for only one other matter: the rise in knife crime in London, the city in which Bruce’s debut was taking place.The new presenter felt fresh and effective, but the BBC should have taken advantage of the succession to shake up the structure as well, and Bruce can only truly be judged when she has some non-Brexit subject matter.As she moves on to Derby and Winchester in the next two weeks, the problem for the host of Antiques Roadshow may be that she has been handed what was sold as a priceless television treasure but which, on close inspection, looks like a rather faded and wobbly relic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8996ac88b93eecb7896ad1e21081b693c458df00/208_0_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcfdb562995be36a982a4dc340493b57","title":"none of this is fair to you the five worst us government shutdowns","story":"The current halt could soon become the longest that has left workers out of pocket, beating Bill Clinton’s battle with Newt GingrichThe US government is about to conclude its third week of a partial shutdown, with 800,000 federal employees sent home or working without pay.Government shutdowns occur when Congress refuses to pass, or the president refuses to sign, a spending bill, cutting off funding to federal departments, like the FBI and parks services.Since 1976, when new budget laws giving Congress more power were enacted, there have been more than 20 gaps in budget funding, though not all of them have led to federal employees being furloughed (meaning sent home on unpaid leave, or working without pay). One shutdown in 1978 under President Jimmy Carter lasted 18 days after Carter vetoed a bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, but federal employees continued to work and be paid.Most shutdowns have lasted just days – Ronald Reagan’s administration faced eight shutdowns lasting less than four days, three of which led to employees being furloughed. Here are the five longest shutdowns in US history that left staff without pay.If Trump’s shutdown continues through the weekend it will become the longest in US history, beating one held during Bill Clinton’s presidency that lasted 21 days. The 1995-1996 shutdown occurred when the president vetoed the budget passed by a Congress led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, which sought to rein in spending on health and education, amongst other things.The shutdown ran from 16 December, 1995 to 6 January, 1996 and followed an earlier, related shutdown.Eventually, after concessions on both sides, the shutdown was resolved and Clinton’s approval ratings shot up.Trump’s shutdown began on 22 December and has been caused by a standoff between the president, who is demanding $5.6bn for his border wall, and Congress, which is refusing to sign off on spending bills giving him that money.As a result of the shutdown, 800,000 federal employees have been sent home or are working without pay and Friday will be the first day that many employees will miss their paychecks.Trump used a televised address to argue for the need for a wall to increase border security and has told reporters that while he would prefer to work with Congress on a deal, he would use his emergency powers to circumvent Congress if it could not come to agreement.“I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” Trump said on Thursday, contradicting legal scholars who have questioned the president’s right to take such action in this case.This shutdown (1-17 October) was caused when House Republicans offered continuing resolutions aimed at delaying or defunding the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. At the time, Obama wrote a letter to the “dedicated and hard-working employees of the United States government” in which he apologised for the disruption to their work, writing: “None of this is fair to you.”This shutdown, lasting 14-19 November, was the first of two related shutdowns, the second of which lasted 21 days. In this initial five-day shutdown, 800,000 workers were furloughed.Monica Lewinsky testified that it was during this November shutdown, when many paid employees had been sent home, that she and Clinton began their sexual relationship.Like the current shutdown, the first shutdown of 2018 was on the subject of immigration. The shutdown began at midnight on 20 January after Republicans and Democrats could not agree on protective measures for people under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. Almost 700,000 federal employees were believed to have been furloughed during the shutdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b722c946badc22bc320e9f36fab48f2927581f0c/109_0_3281_1970/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99616885d44dae5e46b1ab08af4f94ec","title":"canada and australia in talks with un to accept saudi asylum seeker rahaf mohammed al qunun","story":"Thai police say several states considering accepting woman who fled alleged family abuseSeveral countries including Canada and Australia are in talks with the UN refugee agency to accept the Saudi asylum seeker Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun who fled alleged abuse by her family, police in Thailand have said.The immigration police chief said on Friday that the UN was accelerating Qunun’s case, but he gave no indication of when the process would be completed.Qunun, 18, was stopped at a Bangkok airport on Saturday and said her passport was seized.

Both TransCanada, which is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline and Kinder Morgan, which was pushing the TransMountain pipeline, have faced fierce opposition from indigenous groups.Much of the current uncertainty surrounds who companies should consult with when they begin to plans projects which would enter indigenous lands.While elected indigenous officials from communities along the route of the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline have signed benefit agreements with TransCanada, five Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs oppose the plan. The chiefs, who are unelected, argue they retain authority over the sprawling 22,000 sq km of the band’s traditional territory.Christie agreed, saying the hereditary chiefs legal claim to rightful control is “airtight”.“The goal has always been the same for Canada and indigenous people: it’s to remove us from our land and have access to the resources,” said Jennifer Wickham, a member of the Gitdumden, one of five clans making up the Wet’suwet’en nation. “That storyline has never changed.”TransCanada says it has had more than 15,000 “interactions and engagements” with indigenous groups as part of the consultation process. The outcome between protesters and police was “not the one we wanted”, the company in a statement.The events of the past week have cast a shadow over the Trudeau’s image of a political leader seeking reconciliation with Canada’s marginalized and often mistreated First Nations. While he lamented the arrests, his government will maintain its course, arguing the resource projects must be built.“Justin Trudeau has said that reconciliation is a priority for him. I would have to say to him, is this what reconciliation looks like?” said Wickham, whose sister Molly was arrested on Monday when police raided the protest camp.The site was first occupied by indigenous protesters in 2009 and now hosts a complex of buildings, including a traditional healing lodge.Freda Huson, who has lived there for nearly a decade said that for generations the community has lost land to farming and resource development and now fears that the pipeline could taint the only available drinking water in the area.“I shouldn’t have to be dragged into the courts to prove that I own land that I know is ours. Our people owned these territories since time immemorial,” she said. Trudeau pledged to overhaul the framework guiding relations with indigenous communities nearly a year ago. But in areas where no treaties were signed, the courts have often become the arbiter of land claims. In 2014, the Tsilhqot’in people in British Columbia won a longstanding battle over title rights at the country’s highest court – but at a cost of more than $10m.Both Huson and Wickham believe Canadian law is inadequately equipped to handle land claims fights with the government.In 1997 the supreme court put an end to one of the longest-running legal battles in Canadian history, ruling that the Wet’suwet’en had effectively demonstrated clear title to their land.The plaintiffs exhausted more than an estimated $25m on legal fees – only to have a retrial called, leaving uncertainty around their claim.“It doesn’t matter which route we take. We took this to the highest court in the Canada and it was ruled in our favour,” said Wickham. “Even when we follow their western law, it doesn’t do us any good.”Both the federal government and British Columbia have pledged to implement the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNdrip).But Christie argues that until there is a fundamental shift in government attitudes, similar feuds will continue erupt.Huson said: “We’re in the right. We’re not doing anything wrong. This is my home. This is my land. They want to break down my door.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca1f5ac1921c198cc9ce4d757e1eea07cbb38ea/0_57_3572_2143/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c612a9ffff8e11593c8cb7a25b41ea","title":"syria troop withdrawal under way says us led coalition","story":"Combined Joint Task Force spokesman confirms pullout has begun but gives no detailsThe US-led military coalition in Syria has begun withdrawing troops, a spokesman has said, without elaborating on locations or timetables.Col Sean Ryan told Agence France-Presse in a statement: “Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve has begun the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria.“Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements.”The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the coalition had started reducing its presence at Rmelan airfield in the north-eastern province of Hasakah.Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the UK-based monitoring organisation, said some US forces withdrew from the Rmelan military base on Thursday.Last month, Donald Trump said he had ordered the withdrawal of all US forces from Syria, where there are believed to be about American 2,000 troops.Friday’s announcement signalled the first such withdrawal since the president’s announcement, Rahman said.

A congregation of teenagers is frequently described as being anti-social when in fact it is usually just normal social interaction. Parents of younger children often see groups of teenagers using playgrounds in a very negative light,” the report states.It adds that teenagers often feel harassed by adults wherever they go and that they feel fast-food outlets and shopping centres provide somewhere they can go to see and be seen and socialise with their friends. The report notes that teenagers have “ample opportunities” to engage in sports across south Dublin. But it goes on to say that what they really want is areas where they can play in a casual manner or casually engage in physical activity.The report recommends creating a series of hangoutmeeting places for teenagers. “The most popular suggestions from the survey were for places to sit and chat and access play facilities such as swings, climbing and zip lines,” the report says. “Teenagers require more vigorous play than younger children so swinging, spinning and anything that thrills is always popular,” it adds.It also recommended creating areas for unstructured physical activity such as all-weather pitches, skate parks and basketball courts. “Generally this is self-directed activity rather than organised sport,” the report says.It goes on to suggest placing cafes in parks. “These would provide a service to all park users but would be particularly beneficial to teenagers as a social outlet,” it says.Proposed projects for 2019 include:-A robust area of activity for teenagers in Collinstown Park in Clondalkin with a goal, basketball net and a large play equipment items, provision of WiFi and seating scattered throughout the area at an estimated cost of €120,000.-Sport facilities in Griffeen Park in Lucan as well as a tea shopcoffee-pod at an estimated cost of €110,000. -A formal meeting place for teenagers in Ballycragh Park in Rathfarnham along with a play spaceactivity area at an estimated cost of €110,000.-In Tallaght, a giant bench has been proposed for Kingswood to act as a formal meeting area for teenagers, as well as other large play type equipment for older children and WiFi provision at an estimated €40,000. A multi-use games area is earmarked for Avonbeg at an estimated cost of €80,000."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyChina shows first panoramic photos of the far side of the moonWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?How would a no-confidence vote work – and could Jeremy Corbyn really kick Theresa May out of Number 10?Theresa May polls latest: How the Prime Minister\u0026#39s approval rating has been affected by Brexit negotiationsManaged no deal: What exactly does it mean for Brexit – and what will happen?If Parliament votes down the Brexit deal, what could happen next?Theresa May\u0026#39s draft Brexit withdrawal agreement - read in fullDid feud with Donald Trump force Jeff Bezos to announce orce ahead of affair expose?Former Neighbours star Craig McLachlan charged with sex offencesChinese Huawei employee one of two arrested by Poland for \u0026#39spying\u0026#39Will Theresa May resign if she loses the Brexit vote?

What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have? asks Ben ChuClick to followThe IndependentChina and India will be the two biggest economies in the world by 2030, according to a report by analysts at Standard Chartered bank.The US will be a distant third and the UK will not even be in the top 10.Countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and Brazil will all be higher than us on the list.But how plausible are these predictions? What assumptions are they based on? And what\u0026nbspreal significance does any of it have?The answer is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the exchange rate used is something called Purchasing Power Parity\u0026nbsp(PPP).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialStandard Chartered’s projections suggest the size of the Chinese economy in 2030 on this measure will be $64.2 trillion, India’s will be $46.3 and the United States’ will be just $31 trillion.A US dollar generally goes much further in poorer countries than in richer ones – something anyone who has, for instance, eaten out in Thailand or bought something from a market stall while on holiday in Morocco will know.When one makes a statistical adjustment for this fact of erging purchasing power, the measured size of a less developed economy rises. This is GDP at PPP.Using the measure, China is already larger than the US, having surpassed America in 2015.And Indian output at PPP actually surpassed that of the UK way back in 1995.Is there another way of measuring the size of an economy then?Yes. One could use simple market exchange rates.By this measure the US is still today the world’s biggest economy, with a $7 trillion lead over China.Using market exchange rates rather than PPP would also most likely change the 2030 picture.The International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspdoes not forecast beyond 2023, but at this date the Fund thinks the US will still be the world’s largest economy at market exchange rates and that the UK will still have a comfortable lead over the likes of Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and the rest with little evidence of catchup.India, however, will surpass the UK even at market exchange rates in the coming years.Which is the better measure?Views are ided. Some economists argue market exchange rates give a better indication\u0026nbspof the relative importance of national economies in the global trade and financial system.This is certainly the measure that financial traders mostly use.The PPP adjustment is also based on global surveys to measure relative purchasing power which are conducted only\u0026nbspirregularly and infrequently and which are inevitably\u0026nbspsketchy.But other economists\u0026nbspargue that PPP gives a better indication of shifts in a developing country’s domestic consumer demand.“PPP is generally regarded as a better measure of overall wellbeing,” says the IMF.Yet, leaving aside this debate, the important thing to recognise is that neither measure gives an indication of average living standards in each country, of a country’s general level of prosperity.The reason why China is larger than the US at PPP exchange rates is because it has a population four times larger.If one measures GDP at PPP per person a very different picture emerges, with China on $18,000 and the US on $63,000.And the UK is doing far better than India with a GDP at PPP per capita of $46,000 versus just $7,800.Moreover, on the IMF’s projections over the next five years there is little sign of catchup on this metric between the US and the UK and those developing world countries. Not even China gets close.We can pretty safely predict that people in the developed world will, on average, still be much better off than those in developing countries in 2030.How plausible are these projections?Standard Chartered says its forecasts are “underpinned by one key principle: countries’ share of world GDP should eventually converge with their share of the world’s population, driven by the convergence of per-capita GDP between advanced and emerging economies”.This isn’t unreasonable. As developing countries deploy the productivity boosting technologies of the rich world, they should, in theory, become more productive and their growth rates should be more rapid.This is why China has had a double digit GDP annual growth rate for the past 20 years but growth rates in Europe and the US have been below 3 per cent.And ultimately countries with bigger populations should have bigger national economies, whether measured by market exchange rates or PPP.Yet, assuming an uninterrupted catchup path for poorer countries is questionable, crises are inevitable. A few years ago many economists were projecting rapid growth in Brazil, but instead the country fell into a savage recession. One cannot rule out such a temporary reversal for China or India.There has also been a clear tendency for developing countries to get stuck in a “middle income\u0026nbsptrap”\u0026nbspwhere, after rapid growth up to a certain level, developing countries seem unable to make the leap to developed world per capita incomes.Indeed, avoiding this trap has become an obsession for Chinese policymakers in recent years. They are not assuming a straight line to prosperity, even if some western bank analysts are.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Debenhams, M\u0026ampS, and John Lewis had news ranging from the chilly to the goodness me get out the ultra warm super thermals its an arctic winter out there.\u0026nbspWith everyone going at the same time, the pain of the media singing the famous football chant - you’re (insert four letter word) and you know you are - was at least shared.\u0026nbspThe Brtitish Retail Consortium helped out there with industry wide figures and a declaration that 2018 was “the worst Christmas for retail since 2008”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt hardly bears repeating that that was the year of the financial crisis. A horrible recession followed hot on its heels. So if\u0026nbspyou\u0027re inclined to run and hide under the covers no one would blame you.But there were some bright spots. The BRC figures showed sales of food, toys and computers were up, which helps to explain, the decent overall performance put in by the supermarkets. Among them,\u0026nbspAldi did great, Morrisons was ok, Sainsbury’s no worse than feared. Tesco, the latest\u0026nbspto go, confirmed the trend. It reported core UK sales up 2.2 per cent over Christmas.\u0026nbspThe beast is well and truly back.\u0026nbspThe consumer seems to have decided to spend on food and gifts for the kids, while reigning in on everyone and everything else.\u0026nbspSuch belt tightening, coming after years of negative inflation adjusted wage growth, is no bad thing. Borrowing or dipping into the savings, which is what people have been doing over the past few years, is unsustainable long term. The decision by many Britons to conserve resources is particularly wise at a time when the Conservative Government of Theresa May seems hell bent on kicking the country in the teeth.\u0026nbspBut you have to pity the people on the sharp end. Debs is in the worst state. There is a big question mark over the long term future of the department store as a concept, but the rapidity of the decline at this one tells you it’s got it badly wrong.Sales fell by 5.7 per cent over the 18 weeks to January 5. Chief executive Sergio Bucher somehow managed to confirm his profit guidance, but the ongoing conversations about refinancing he’s having to hold with lenders can’t be easy. Would you be keen to lend to this business?The decline in sales at M\u0026ampS - 2.2 per cent - was par for the course for this one time high street bellwether that has been scratching its corporate head about how to get things moving for years now.\u0026nbspCompared to those two the John Lewis Partnership is basking in the sunlit uplands. Even with distressed rivals throwing cheap stock out of their doors before closing them, it managed to report a 1 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least year.\u0026nbspThat might not look like anything to write home about, but there are plenty of retail bosses that would e into a pool full of hungry crocodiles if it meant they\u0026nbspcould get even close to that.\u0026nbspProfits will be down this year, but they\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspstill be decent enough. The only fly in the ointment was the warning that\u0026nbspemployee partners may not get a bonus for the first time since 1953.\u0026nbspThe final decision on that is made in March, which is significant because that’s the month when Brexit is supposed to happen.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

People will choose their provider often because of a cheap introductory deal and then stay for the content offering.“However, you shouldn’t accept getting a bad deal, there are potential savings to be made for those who take the time to haggle and even bigger savings for those who switch.”A Sky spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Just like Which? Magazine, we have a range of offers for both new and existing customers. We encourage all of our customers to join Sky VIP – a loyalty programme that says thank you to customers for their time with us, with exclusive offers and experiences.”Digital minister Margot James said: “It is outrageous for loyal customers to be penalised like this and I’d encourage them to always shop around for the best deal once their initial contract ends.“We’ve strengthened Ofcom’s powers to better protect consumers, and will continue to work with Which? and others on a fairer and more transparent system that helps people save money.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

App developers share data with Facebook through the Facebook Software Developer Kit (SDK), a set of software development tools that help developers build apps for a specific operating system.Apps found to be sharing data with Facebook included language-learning tool Duolingo, job database Indeed and flight search engine Skyscanner. A spokesperson for Skyscanner\u0026nbspsaid it had updated its data-collecting practices in the wake of the report.Facebook said that sharing data is common practice for many companies and that it did so in a transparent manner.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It\u0027s also studied objects in our own solar system, discovering some of the tiny moons around Pluto, as well as a\u0026nbsp14th\u0026nbspmoon around Neptune. It takes pictures in both visible and ultraviolet light, as well as near infrared.\u0026nbspOrbiting 350 miles (560\u0026nbspkilometers) above Earth, Hubble was launched in 1990 and visited by space shuttle astronauts, for repairs and upgrades, five times.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbspassociate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen\u0026nbspsaid that such problems were to be expected and that they were being looked over by experienced engineers.Last fall, Hubble stopped working altogether for three weeks because of a pointing problem. This is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handle science operations for the telescope.\u0026nbspNASA is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue, Gundy said Wednesday.\u0026nbspWe would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and NASA is making that happen, even with the partial government shutdown, she added.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

People will choose their provider often because of a cheap introductory deal and then stay for the content offering.“However, you shouldn’t accept getting a bad deal, there are potential savings to be made for those who take the time to haggle and even bigger savings for those who switch.”A Sky spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Just like Which? Magazine, we have a range of offers for both new and existing customers. We encourage all of our customers to join Sky VIP – a loyalty programme that says thank you to customers for their time with us, with exclusive offers and experiences.”Digital minister Margot James said: “It is outrageous for loyal customers to be penalised like this and I’d encourage them to always shop around for the best deal once their initial contract ends.“We’ve strengthened Ofcom’s powers to better protect consumers, and will continue to work with Which? and others on a fairer and more transparent system that helps people save money.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Labour MP Martin Whitfield said: “It is humiliating for the prime minister to be told to her face that the whole world wants to avoid a no-deal scenario, yet she still refuses to rule it out.“Countries across the globe are looking at Britain in despair.

Through membership of this organisation, however, the country is required to accept the EU’s four freedoms –\u0026nbspincluding the free movement of people.This would of course be inconceivable for many Brexiteers and the prime minister consistently referred to ending the free movement of people as one of her “red lines”\u0026nbspduring the negotiations.EU ‘reflecting’ on how it can give Theresa May more help on BrexitRAF unveils stealth fighter for ‘new era’ of defence after BrexitNo-deal Brexit ‘catastrophic’ for UK food supplies, say farmersCorbyn indicates Labour will back Brexit delay During her recent trip to the G20 in Buenos Aires, the prime minister told reporters: “What we are doing as a government as a whole is looking at producing a set of immigration rules which ensure that the thing we are doing is bringing an end to to free movement”.\u0026nbspIt is clear that a Norway-style model\u0026nbspwould make this impossible, but some of those advocating the option (under the banner “Common Market 2.0”),\u0026nbspincluding the Tory MP Robert Halfon and Labour’s Lucy Powell, suggest it could nonetheless gain widespread public support.\u0026nbspOn immigration specifically they claim new controls over free movement in certain circumstances would be available as the EEA allows members to suspend free movement if a country can demonstrate it is experiencing “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.\u0026nbspUltimately, though, it’s hard to see how the UK government could\u0026nbspmake\u0026nbspsuch an extreme argument\u0026nbspand in any case, such a move would only be temporary. This is why many MPs\u0026nbspfrom constituencies that voted Leave (on both side of the House)\u0026nbspare uneasy about backing the model.\u0026nbspIndeed,\u0026nbspErna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister, recently pointed out that the UK would eventually have to accept the four freedoms under a model similar to her country, and asked: “Should you leave the EU if you’re accepting that?”“You can’t just opt out of one of the freedoms,” she added.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think after this week the idea that parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely.He said thwarting Brexit would be potentially very damaging and warned that it was now a choice between Ms May\u0027s deal and no Brexit. This marks a shift in tone, as the prime minister has repeatedly set out a choice between her deal and no deal.Brexit upheaval should spark a hopeful look at our future in EuropeGove brands Labour\u0027s Brexit plans \u0027b*****ks\u0027 in CommonsWhat does a Norway-style model mean for immigration after Brexit?May demands explanation for Bercow\u0027s decision to allow Brexit voteProject Fear tactics have gone into overdriveIf this deal is rejected, ultimately what we may end up with is not a different type of Brexit but Brexit paralysis, he told the Today programmeAnd Brexit paralysis ultimately could lead to no Brexit.I\u0027m saying this would be an\u0026nbspincredibly damaging breach of trust and it would also be very bad for Britain\u0027s reputation abroad, having decided to leave the EU, if we in the end for whatever reasons found that we weren\u0027t able to do it.Pro-EU MPs seized on Mr Hunt comments as a boost to their cause, claiming he had effectively admitted the prime minister\u0027s no-deal warnings were a false threat.Labour\u0027s David Lammy, who supports the\u0026nbspPeople’s Vote campaign, said: “Jeremy Hunt has confirmed publicly what more and more of his colleagues are saying in private - that if MPs can’t agree on Theresa May’s deal next week, the only way forward is to give the public the final say on Brexit through a People’s Vote.“The idea that if MPs vote down the deal, we head to no deal has always been a false threat and the Foreign Secretary has now effectively admitted it.“There is no Brexit deal that fulfils all the promises made in the last referendum - or one as good as the deal we’ve already got inside the EU. Instead of embarking on another fruitless effort of renegotiation, it is time to hand this crucial decision back to the people.”It comes as work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd became the latest cabinet minister to refuse to rule out resigning from the cabinet in the event of a no deal Brexit, echoing the business secretary Greg Clark.During an interview with the Today programme,\u0026nbspMs Rudd three times declined to say whether she would remain a member of the government if it opted for a chaotic exit.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families.

We aren’t done playing.’”But once his image was released by his rescuers, the world reacted with shock and sadness at the image of Kennys deformed face.He was labelled the worlds ugliest tiger with people saying he looked like a dog rather than a big cat.Commenting on images of Kenny on the refuges Facebook page, one person, labelled tiger inbreeding as one of the most ignorant, abusive acts at playing God that Ive ever seen.And while many claimed he was the first tiger with Downs Syndrome scientists say that, as the condition is caused by an extra copy of a specic chromosome, only animals closely related to humans, such as chimpanzees, can have it.The sanctuary said that inbreeding caused his unusual characteristics.Although tigers in the wild typically live to , Kenny died from an aggressive form of skin cancer eight years after his rescue, at the young age of .Tiger farms are hugely popular in Asia and are quickly turning into a global industry.Often disguising themselves as animal sanctuaries, they look to meet increasing demands for tiger fur, body parts and domesticated tigers to be kept as pets.Skins are turned into luxury rugs, tiger bones are used to make “self-healing” health tonics and wines and the meat is popular with high-flying businessmen, who believe that consuming the cats will improve their performance at work.Shockingly, tigers are often shot through the eyes so that their fur is not damaged.The growth of the illegal farms has driven down the going price of £, for a white tiger cub to just under £,.Elisa Allen, Director of PETA UK told Sun Online: White tigers are not a species but simply an aberrant colour iation of Bengal tigers, and breeding them is done solely to draw paying crowds.All captive white tigers are inbred, which has led to serious congenital defects, including cataracts, clubfoot, and near-crippling hip dysplasia.Tigers are on the very brink of extinction, yet one of the biggest threats they face is the  promise of captive-breeding programmes.None of the tigers born in captivity will ever be released, so these programmes do nothing to help wild tiger populations.If big-cat species are to survive, our focus must sht from breeding and displaying them in captivity to habitat preservation in the wild. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The trial will start in July this year.After the trial is over, Ms Rudd will look at how it worked and consider best how to put everyone onto the new new flagship welfare policy.MPs need to vote to approve both the trial, and also on how to put the million others onto the new system.That meansyoure currently on benefits youre unlikely to move over to the new system this year.But Theresa May has said the programme is still on track to be done by  - with everyone on it.The news comes just after The Sun launched its Make Universal Credit Work campaign, demanding ministers make more changes to the flagship policy now before its too late.Weve told countless stories of how Brits are being pushed into debt waiting for their first payment, and have been forced to food banks and to payday loans.Ms Rudd revealed also revealed that the number of people who will be on Universal Credit will DOUBLE by the end of the year - as people naturally move over.This means thatyou have a change of circumstance - likeyou move home, your partner moves in with you, or you lose your job and have to make a new claim for benefits, then you will go onto Universal Credit.Ministers expect there to be another .million people who go onto Universal Credit in that way this year.And they wont be able to get any help with payments when they change over either, leaving many hundreds of pounds worse off.No, its just the process for people already on benefits which is being considered at the moment.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one monthly payment, but the rollout has been beset with issues.Its now in every jobcentre in the country and is unlikely to be ditched altogether.MPs are worried about thousands of vulnerable and disabled Brits who could slip through the net and lose their benefits in the transfer.Others are urging the Government to transfer them over automatically, rather than make them sign up all over again.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the Commons, said: I will want to consider carefully when I bring to the House the vote for the three million managed migration, which is scheduled for . Im still considering when to do that.She added: The , pilot as always, which was announced some time ago, informs us how we do that.Yes. In the last Budget Philip Hammond promised to increase the work allowances for people on Universal Credit by £, - allowing millions to earn £ extra every year from April this year.He also revealed:Theres lots of help out there for people who are already on Universal Credit and wont be seeing any changes anytime soon.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit. Number one, we keep our £billion — the cost of Theresa May’s deal. That is taxpayers’ money that can be used to boost British businesses.We will be free to enter into new trade deals. We are the fth largest economy in the world. The suggestion that we are too small to cut trade deals is nonsense.Australia, a much smaller economy than ours, negotiated deals with China, South Korea and Japan in just  months.Iceland has an agreement with China and its economy is tiny compared to ours. We would be free to run our economy as we wish, slashing red tape and burdensome regulation.Our friendships across the world with Commonwealth and other English-speaking countries can be re-energised. We have nothing to fear.The risks of staying in the EU, by contrast, are great.The EU has not been an economic success. Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear. They won’t listen to the British people.They want to reverse the result of the referendum by almost any means.No one should believe their blinkered view and this country should not be held hostage by it.Britain has always been a world leader. We should not doubt that we always will be.A No Deal Brexit is the only way of ending the uncertainty and allowing us to get on with our lives as a successful, independent nation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The aim is to swtly paint her into a ­corner from which her only escape is the second referendum Remainers optimistically believe would reverse Brexit.Bercow, supposedly the gatekeeper of our ancient Commons procedures, defied his officials’ advice and tore up the rule book to make this happen.Why  Because this supposedly unbiased Speaker deludes himself, like the Remain diehards whose dirty work he enables, that he is the dashing hero of a noble anti-Brexit ­insurgency .That’s right: the first “rebellion” to take back control for London’s rich, europhile establishment elite from a public that demanded change and was promised it by these very same politicians.Bercow has violated the impartiality of a historic office which he still holds solely because Remainers disgracefully ignored serious bullying allegations against him to secure his help.But equally dishonourable are those Tories whose weird religious devotion to the EU would now see them sacrice their own Prime Minister, Government, party and — more importantly — the ­stability of our democracy and country.The same goes for Corbyn’s MPs, who lie about honouring the Leave votes of millions of Labour supporters but would reject ANY deal Mrs May produced for one reason: it would mean leaving the EU.We hope the constituents this dismal rabble are busy betraying will make amends whenever an election is called.As for John “B****cks to Brexit” ­Bercow, his prejudices have skewed his judgment, fatally compromised his role, are directly hindering Brexit and have cost him the trust of half the Commons.Time’s up.A BOY of  butchered in the street. Parts of London looking like a Mexican drug-war zone.

This is making her mark.”The charity helps women with clothes and training for job interviews, preparing them with the confidence to get into the workforce Meghan’s determination to put female empowerment on the national stage has shone through with her introducing Smart Works.The charity helps women prepare for job interviews, helping them train and find clothes to give them the confidence they need.Mr Fitzwilliams said: “The caring aspect of Meghan we have already seen – she was protesting for female empowerment at the age of  against a sexist ad.“It’s all very much part of her personality and she has championed it all her le.“This is her opportunity to shine on the world stage, where she is already iconic.“I would expect female empowerment to be a theme when any other patronages are announced.”This animal welfare charity works to improve le for cats and dogs, helping to rehome and vaccinate themMeghan was already known as an animal lover – a dog owner to several pups with Prince Harry herself.And while Mr Fitzwilliam said he was initially surprised by the charity, it fit well with the Duchess’ devotion to the furry animals.He said: “We know she’s a dog lover, and this just shows it.”Meghan herself owns a beagle Guy, and brought him over from Toronto to London when she moved in with Prince Harry.Meghan adopted Guy and Labrador-German Shepherd mix Bogart from a dog rescue centre in Los Angeles while she was with her first husband, film producer, Trevor Engelson.Bogart was too old to make the long journey, and is now being looked after by her friends.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently adopted a new black Labrador.Mr Fitzwilliam said he would not be surprisedMeghan embraced a LGBTQ patronage in the future.He said: “It will be interesting to seeLGBTQ patronages are introduced, because she has spoken about the need for equality on that issue before.”And he said that while there had been reports Meghan felt “constrained” by her new role and a royal and the limits to speaking out, she would find new ways.He added: “There are obvious limits to outspokenness in a royal world.“But you can help in other ways. You can highlight things, campaign at the top, and others will listen to you.”It will be a busy year for Meghan, who is expecting her first child with Prince Harry in the Spring.The couple, who married in May last year, are also expecting to move to Frogmore Cottage ahead of their babys arrival.The Grade-II listed county retreat, set in four acres of rolling Oxfordshire hills, boasts four bedrooms with one converted to a dressing room."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004611001501.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd hints brits on universal credit could get cash more often","story":"The Work and Pensions Secretary will announce on Friday that she will oversee a new pilot scheme to pay people moving on to the scheme more frequently - in a win for The Sun’s Make Universal Credit Work campaign.If that change was rolled out across the system it could slash the wait desperate Brits face for their first payment down from five weeks.As part of her new approach to the flagship welfare system she will later reveal a “more flexible” approach to childcare - helping millions of working parents across the country who struggle to claim their costs back.The Sun has demanded that ministers make vital changes to the system before it’s too late.We’ve told heartbreaking tales of how Brits are drowning in thousands of pounds worth of debt waiting for help, and have had to give up work due to the complicated childcare system.So we’ve called on ministers to let Brits keep more of what they earn, get paid faster and get help for childcare upfront.Ms Rudd will also pump £million of extra money into the troubled programme, and announce that the extension of the two child benefit cap will be scrapped because it is “not right”.That will mean Brits on Universal Credit can keep their benefitsthey have three or more kids - helping , families.Ministers have already limited child benefit to two kids for those on the old benefits system.Anyone with a third child born after April  did not qualy for extra cash.They were due to extend the cap to Brits on Universal Credit to all third children regardless of when they were born - but this will now be ditched.And she also revealed:“But to really get to grips with the problems of universal credit, the government will need to go further. This means investing more in the benefit so people have enough to live on and don’t have to wait five weeks for a first payment, while also making sure it is paid in a way that works for people’s inidual circumstances.”In February single mum Elise, , who lives near Manchester, moved on to UC and immediately her £ Child Tax Credit weekly payments were stopped, leaving her unable to pay nursery bills for -year-old Lexey and Darcy, .Previously the government had covered around  per cent of her £ a week childcare bills, paying this sum directly to the nursery.Elise, who is currently pregnant with her third child, was able to pay the weekly shortfall of £ out of her monthly £ salary.Under the new system parents are able to claim back up to  per cent of childcare costs - but they must do this in arrears, meaning they need the cash up front to pay the nursery bills.Elise struggled to find the money to pay for her daughters childcare, and when she failed to pay her bills in August, Lexey and Darcy lost their nursery places.I was devastated. Lexey in particular was so settled and really enjoyed going to nursery, said Elise. “Now they are at home all the time, missing out, missing their friends. Its awful, I feel so sad for them.Ms Rudd is expected to say today: “These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only one in place.“So today I can announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two child limit on Universal Credit before children born before April .”She will say that the welfare system should reflect British values of “fairness and compassion” and help people who have lost their way.But she will still press ahead with plans to pilot , people this year onto the new system, and learn from that approach for the other  million who will be transferred later.“It is there to help a person get through a dficult stage in le – it is not meant to be a mode of long term subsistence for those who can work.“I believe that for the vast majority of people it is ultimately work, not benefits, which provides the route to a better le.”The pilot will begin in July this year and over the next  months Rudd will continue to review the system.But it wasnt enough to cover their bills and buy food so they ended up flogging their stuff and taking out payday loans - and now owe over £,.It made us feel so humiliated, worthless, said Kirsty. “Having worked so hard for everything only then to lose it because of Universal Credit, it’s very damaging to a human being.They never know how much theyll get on Unviersal Credit due to Dales job as a HGV driver due to his unpredictible hours and have been hit by the taper rate.If Dale is lucky enough to secure more shts than usual in a month then the familys Universal Credit payment is taxed at a rate of  pence per pound.“It’s making people vulnerable, knowing they have to wait a certain number of weeks to get a payment, she said.

It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess.

This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ann Marie Grocott of Silverdale, Newcastle-under-Lyme, had reported her -year-old son, Jordan Taylor, missing on Easter Monday last year when he failed tohome from a weekend with friends. Ms Grocott and other relatives searched an old railway tunnel after receiving no news in three days. They found the teenagers body lying in a tunnel - covered in mud - with his shoes and mobile phones discarded nearby.   Jordans death remained a mystery in between the moment he left a house party on the night of April  - Easter Sunday - and the discovery of his body on April , an inquest heard. Ms Grocott revealed that Jordan had suffered from anxiety and depression since leaving school and had barely left the house for  months, reported StokeonTrent Live . Since being prescribed medication, the youngsters situation had improved and had started to socialise with friends. Its reported that Jordan left his home in Sneyd Terrace, Silverdale, on March , and intending to stay a friends over the weekend. According to Ms Grocott, she received messages from Jordan every day but heard nothing after Sunday lunchtime. She reported him missing on Easter Monday and police sent out helicopters to search for Jordan.   On Thursday, April , Ms Grocott and close family members went to look on land off Pepper Street, where the old railway tunnel is situated. We went on the tracks and walked towards the tunnel, she said.Me and my sister were looking up the sides of the tunnel. I saw his shoe first, up the side of the bridge. Then I heard my name being shouted. I turned and Jordan was there. Staffordshire Police launched an investigation into the death of Jordan as they interviewed people who had been with Jordan over the weekend. However, there was no evidence of third-party involvement in his death. It is believed the teen was last seen alive on Easter Monday when a resident of Coppice Avenue saw a youth thought to be Jordan reclined on top of the tunnel. Pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar concluded Jordan died from hypothermia and there were no evidence showing Jordan had been assaulted upon the post-mortem examination results. A high level of beta hydroxybutyrate was found in Jordans body, which indicated he had a previously undiagnosed problem with his insulin problems. Dr Kolar explained hypothermia can lead to severe confusion and sufferers can undress themselves believing they are feeling hot - which could explain why Jordan was not wearing his shoes. The test also revealed the teen had amphetamine and ecstasy in his system and he had also taken cocaine.   The level of drug was not toxic, but would have been important in whats taken place, Dr Kolar said. Iniduals that have taken drugs are more vulnerable to developing hypothermia - they are more likely to put themselves in situations that are not advisable, and drugs have an effect on the way the body regulates its own temperature. The cause of death was recorded as hypothermia, possibly diabetes-related, with a background of MDMAand amphetamine use. North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith recorded a conclusion of misadventure in Jordans death. He said: “Jordan was a vulnerable, naiumlve young lad in a situation where he did things because others were doing it. I think that’s the reason he took the drugs. “He left the house where he had been on Sunday night. No-one saw him leave. In his drug-affected state he left behind his bag. “He was seen in the area near his home on Monday. Why, oh why, did he not go home  The only explanation is the effect of the drugs and then the hypothermia, which has created this very confused state of mind. He has remained there until his body has given up at some stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"amber rudd brands no deal","story":"NewsAmber Rudd brands No Deal Brexit a CAR CRASH as she refuses to rule out quittingThe top Tory made the comments as her colleague Jeremy Hunt admitted No Deal Brexit can be BLOCKED in ParliamentShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video tory-amber-rudd-brands-no-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA top Tory has compared Brexit to an actual car crash as she refused three times to rule out quitting the Cabinet. Amber Rudd made the astonishing analogy as new Cabinet ructions emerged ahead of almost certain defeat for Theresa Mays deal. And in a major development, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested No Deal Brexit can be BLOCKED in Parliament. Remain-backing ministers like Ms Rudd and Greg Clark fear the PM will full-throatedly back No Dealher deal is beaten in the Commons. Questioned by the BBC, the Work and Pensions Secretary refused three times to rule out resigningthat happens after Tuesday.  In the eyebrow-raising comments she said: This government is right to have effectively a seatbelt on when were driving a fast car. To make sure we have preparations for No Deal just in case, but I intend to work with colleagues to make sure we avoid it.And she slapped down Jeremy Hunt who said Britain could flourish and prosper with no deal.We will find a way to succeed but I do not think No Deal will be good for this country and Im committed to making sure we find an alternative, she said.   Speaking later to the BBC, the Foreign Secretary warned there was a risk of Brexit paralysisthe deal is voted down on Tuesday. And in a major development he also appeared to concede Parliament can BLOCK a No Deal Brexit. Speaking after two government defeats over Brexit in two days, he said: I think its now looking much less likely that parliament would allow a no deal outcome anyway. Weve seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and shape outcomes. I think after this week the idea that parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely. Parliament can do lots of dferent things. William Hague wrote... it is very unrealistic,parliament set its mind to it, to think parliament wouldnt find a way.   Desperate Theresa May has even rung union leaders, including Unites Len McCluskey, amid warnings she faces the biggest defeat since the Second World War. More than  Tory MPs have spoken out against the deal before Christmas, and since then only two have publicly changed tack. The biggest post-war defeat was by  votes in , according to academic Philip Cowley, of Queen Mary University London. Before that Mrs May must look back to , which holds the only three examples of a government losing by more than  votes. Mr Hunt warned not to deliver Brexit would be a fundamental breach of trust that politicians would regret for many many generations.

But just moments before filming, the experienced presenter admitted to the crowd that she was “nervous” on her first show, but encouraged them to “boo, hiss and clap what you like”. Bruce, , was praised for not letting the politicians “waffle” and for keeping the debate moving. Audience member Damian Singh told the : “She gave all the dferent ists time to put their time across. “There were a few times when she challenged Emily Thornberry and James Cleverly because they weren’t really answering the question and she kept saying come back to the question, come back to the question. “She was very good at that and overall she was very good. “She did give a little talk beforehand saying it is my first time, I’m a little bit nervous, but during the show she was excellent. “She said don’t be afraid to hiss and boo and clap what you like and ask as many questions as you want.” Colin McLeod said: “It was a very polished performance, there were a couple of little technical problems but she just sailed through it. “She was really confident. You would have thought she had been doing the job for years. “She didn’t let any of the politicians politic too much and when the politicians tried to take the discussion, like for example when James Cleverly wanted to talk about the Mayoral elections, she shut them down straight away.” And Jonathan Watson added: “I think she was very natural, very relaxed and like the pro that she is. She does all dferent types of shows so she looked very at home. Controlled the audience well, kept the debate flowing and didn’t let the politicians have it all their own way. “I thought she was perhaps a bit tougher with them than David Dimbleby used to be. “She wouldn’t let them cut off topic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mps could block brexit parliament","story":"NewsMPs could BLOCK Brexit in Parliament, says top Tory Jeremy Hunt\"I think after this week the idea that parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely,\" the Foreign Secretary saidShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN NewsMr Hunt told the BBC they could enact aBrexit paralysis that would prevent Brexit happening entirely \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs will be able to BLOCK a No Deal Brexit in Parliament, top Tory Jeremy Hunt has suggested.

If shes defeated, Mrs May has insisted she will press ahead and could make No Deal government policy - sparking a string of resignations. Until now it was claimed MPs would be unsuccessful in their efforts to block No Deal, because its written into the law.But Mr Hunt told the BBC they could enact aBrexit paralysis that would prevent Brexit happening entirely.Speaking after two government defeats over Brexit in two days, he said: I think its now looking much less likely that parliament would allow a no deal outcome anyway.   Weve seen from this week that parliament has the ability to assert itself and shape outcomes. I think after this week the idea that parliament is going to do nothing at all is highly unlikely. Parliament can do lots of dferent things. William Hague wrote... it is very unrealistic,parliament set its mind to it, to think parliament wouldnt find a way. It comes despite a Brexit minister saying this week there is no parliamentary route that would allow pro-EU MPs to stop the UK leaving the EU.   Chris Heaton-Harris told the Exiting the EU Committee on Wednesday he expected Brexit to happen on March  and that the Government was not planning to either revoke or extend Article  to delay departure. The Daventry MP, one of Brexit Secretary Steve Barclays deputies at the Department for Exiting the EU, was asked by the SNPs Peter Grant whether he agreed with the Prime Minister thatthe deal is voted down its possible that Brexit might not happen . Mr Hearton-Harris replied: The legislation is set out now, and the fact that we have activated Article , I actually still believe we will be leaving the EU on March  at pm. Is there a parliamentary route with which Brexit can be stopped  I do not believe so.

But dissatisfied host Fiona Bruce asked: Does anybody have any idea what the plan B is  Literally anybody I think the plan B, from my personal…I think what should happen is that MPs who think there is some miraculous better choice, some unicorn option that Emily [Thornberry, Labour ] has put forward, the idea that Jeremy Corbyn …  But Bruce interrupted, saying: ”No, no.

The Work and Pensions Secretary confirmed that she was delaying asking Parliament for permission to move three million people on to UC until next year, after a pilot of the transfer from existing benefits has been completed. And she announced that controversial plans to apply a two-child benefit cap retrospectively to new Universal Creditclaimants are to be scrapped, helping around , families. MsRuddalso signalled that an end is in sight to the longstanding benefit freeze introduced by former chancellor George Osborne in , telling Sky News she did not expect it to be renewed in . She said it was not reasonable to impose the two-child cap - intended to force claimants to make decisions on whether they can afford a third child in the same way as those in work - on families which already have more than two offspring. Other changes will make the system more inidual, tailoring it to claimants needs by making payments more regular or paying rent money direct to landlords.   She said she also would build a nudge into the system to ensure that a couples UC payment was much more likely to go to childrens primary carer-giver - usually the woman. MsRuddtold BBC Radio s Today programme that she remained committed to the completion of the migration of claimants of six old benefits onto UC by . Im absolutely convinced that Universal Credit is a far better system than the legacy system it replaces, she said. This is a really ambitious project. Its going to impact on  million peoples lives when it is finally completed. It is inevitable that, as we roll it out, as we make the changes, we are learning about how to do it better. Maybe things that were were proposed previously werent effective or werent compassionate in the way that I want them to be. So Im going to be perfectly bold about making those changes where I need to. She added: Im not accepting that it wasnt compassionate in the first place. It was. Im just reinforcing that. MsRudddefended Mr Osbornes benefit freeze, saying it had been right to introduce it in an age of austerity. She told Sky: The whole point about the three-year benefit freeze was making sure that people on low incomes had the same rises as people on benefits. This was a time when inflation was very low and it was the right thing to do at the time, given that we also had the massive debts that the country had inherited from Labour. It was the right policy at the time, its got one more year to run, I look forward to it coming off. Pressed on when this might be, she added: It has one more year to run ... I do not expect that to be renewed at all. MsRuddwas using her first major welfare speech on Friday to try to allay fears about the roll-out of UC. She will say: As it stands, from February  the two-child limit will be applied to families applying for Universal Credit who had their children before the cap was even announced. That is not right. These parents made decisions about the size of the family when the previous system was the only system in place. So, I can today announce that I am going to scrap the extension of the two-child limit on Universal Credit for children born before April .   All children born before that date will continue to be supported by Universal Credit. This will help approximately , families a year. The two-child cap limits support for families through tax credits, housing benefit and UC to the first two offspring. Subsequent children, except in special cases, are not entitled to the child element, which is currently pound, a year. MsRudds move came as the Commons Work and Pensions Committee branded the plans to retrospectively extend the cap to children born before it was brought in cruel. The committee expressed fears about the impact of such a move on the levels of child poverty. Spelling out plans to slow down the managed migration to UC of claimants whose circumstances have not changed, MsRuddwill say: I am going to change the current regulations, removing the powers Government previously planned to seek to migrate all legacy claimants on to the new system. Instead I am only going to seek powers for a pilot: the chance to support , people through the process, giving us the opportunity to learn how to provide the best support, before coming back to Parliament to seek permission for future migration. This will begin, as planned, from July  and the next six months will be a period of careful preparation. I will consider carefully the results of the pilot and its implications for scaling up migration. Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the move was a partial U-turn that did not go far enough. She said: Universal Credit simply is not working: it is pushing many families into poverty, rent arrears and towards food banks. The Government must stop the roll-out immediately before more people are pushed into financial hardship. But Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: Its encouraging to see the Secretary of State taking a fresh look at the welfare system. Universal Credit has to work in practice as well as in theory.

Anyone that has ever been burgled will tell you that the cost goes beyond the value of the items stolen, from the psychological impact of your home being violated to the dficulty of replacing things with sentimental value.That’s why it’s surprising to see that almost half of people haven’t put any additional protection in place for their home, despite one in five believing they live in a burglary hotspot.   postcode areas with the lowest burglary rates Contents theft rateCA - Whitehaven, Cumbria .

Ms Garland added: For thieves, it’s all about risk versus reward –the reward looks likely to exceed the risk, they are going to target that home. Homeowners must do as much as possible to tip the balance in their favour and make things harder for burglars. People who have been targeted by thieves previously pay an average of . per cent more for contents insurance, so it pays to ensure your home is as protected as possible.If you take precautions - such as fitting new door and window locks, installing bar windows where necessary and using security cameras – you can reduce both your contents insurance and your anxiety about getting burgled.Looking for the best deal possible at every renewal will also help keep premiums low.

This comes after weeks of very little activity being reported by Public Health England . Millions are suffering symptoms such as a fever, chills and body aches and experts fear that this could put pressure on the already stretched NHS. The virus is now circulating widely across the UK and within the space of a week, cases have risen by  per cent in England and by  per cent in Wales. Meanwhile reports of the flu have risen by  per cent and by  per cent in Northern Ireland. PHE publishes a weekly report showing the number of flu symptoms that have been recorded in GP consultations.   Based on how often flu symptoms are reported per , patients each country sets its own criteria on what it considers to be an epidemic. While none of the home nations have reached the point of being an epidemic yet, England and Wales are in the “low” threshold. This is the second step on a five-point scale towards “very high” which are epidemic levels. Meanwhile in Scotland and Northern Ireland, levels are at the first threshold, which is baseline. The North East, West Midlands, North West England and Yorkshire and Humber have a “medium intensity” of cases, making it the worst affected. London, the South East, East Midlands, South West and East of England are less affected and are at “low intensity”. Regional figures are not available for Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Rates are at their worse since monitoring began in September and over three months  people have died of the illness. PHE figures released today revealed that the UK had one average  flu diagnoses per , people last week. And it showed that the HN strainwas the most widespread.  In the previous week there was a  per cent rise, which was the final week of . PHE added that the increase of cases means that the flu is having a “moderate impact” on hospitals and intensive care units. One third of this season’s flu cases that needed treatment intensive care happened last week - which is  of a  total. PHE is advising anyone who is eligible to get the flu jabthey have not already. For the first time this winter, all primary school children are now eligible for a free nasal spray flu vaccine as well as children aged two and three years old on August , . The vaccine is also being offered to staff working in residential care and nursing homes this winter who have regular client contact.

Dietitians are urging people across the UK to eat more fibre, which is neglected in around  percent of the populations diet. Eating wholegrain foods which contain dietary fibre could reduce the risk of contracting a range of deadly diseases including diabetes and cancer, a study has concluded. The risk of contracting a wide range of communicable diseases, including heart disease, could fall by as much as a third with a diet containing grains, pulses and wholegrain bread. Experts from the University of Otago in New Zealand and the University of Dundee say people should be eating around g of fibre a day. A team looked at clinical trials and studies conducted over the last four decades involving more than a million people with the findings published in the Lancet.   For every , participants in the  studies and trials, the impact of consuming higher fibre intakes translates into  fewer deaths and six fewer cases of coronary heart disease when compared to those consuming lower fibre diets. Dr Andrew Reynolds, lead author of the study, says the results showed there was clear evidence people should increase their intake of fibre. He said: Our research indicates we should have at least  to  grams of fibre from foods daily, although most of us currently consume less than  grams of fibre daily.  The study was commissioned by the World Health Organisation which is looking at the development of new recommendations for optimal daily fibre intake. Co-author professor Jim Mann said: This study is essential as there is increased public confusion over what to base our meal choices on, and the impact our dietary choices have on our risk of certain diseases.

Heart-stopping CCTV footage from the bus captured Irena Ivics heroic actions as the small girl, who was just -months-old, wandered alone along a pavement just days before Christmas. Ms Ivic had to do a double take when she saw the child - who was dressed only in a onesie and a nappy in the freezing cold - without an adult in sight, but quickly parked the bus and gave chase. The mum and former teacher ran across a busy street, stopped traffic and snatched the crying youngster out of harms way before carrying her back to the bus.   Ms Ivic has been hailed after video of the shocking incident was released by her bosses in the US city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She said shes grateful she was in the right place at the right time. The incident happened just before am on December  last year. Video from the Milwaukee County Transit Systembus shows the girl running back and forth on the flyover as Ms Ivic stops her bus on the opposite side of the road.  She gets out and holds up her hand, signalling an oncoming driver to stop as she runs across the road. She then grabs the girl, who is standing at an intersection near some homes, and carries her back to the bus. Ms Ivic says: Oh my God, oh my God. Im shaking. A passenger tells her: I am, too.  Ms Ivic gets back into her seat at the front of the bus, and cradles the child as a passenger approaches from the back of the vehicle and hands over her jacket to help the child warm up. She strokes the child to keep her calm, and the girl falls asleep in her arms. Ms Ivic called in the rescue and waited for police and firefighters to arrive. Footage from the bus CCTV system shows the girl being carried away by a police officer as a search for her family was under way. The toddler was cold and scared but unharmed.  The baby’s father said his we has a mental illness and she took the baby to a church near the motorway. He told a local Fox TV station that he thinks she forgot about their daughter and the girl wandered off.He said he noticed his daughter was not home when he saw police in the area. The MCTS said of the incident: As Irena called for help, a passenger gave up her coat to help keep the baby warm. The child was cold to the touch after spending time outside in the freezing temperatures.  Irena comforted the terried youngster, who soon fell asleep in her loving arms. Spokesman Matt Sliker said: Authorities eventually reunited the baby with its father. The mother was not charged. At a commendation ceremony on Thursday, Ms Ivic told reporters: Im just grateful I was in the right place at the right time. She added: I absolutely love kids. I used to be a teacher and I have children of my own, so Im so happy I was able to help this sweet, innocent baby. The MCTS said the girl was the ninth lost or missing child to be found by one of its bus drivers in recent years.

The nurse pulled too hard during a dficult birth and ended up splitting the baby in two, horror reports in India claim. He then hid the body of the newborn while sending the mum to another hospital saying there had been a problem and she needed further treatment, it is claimed. The nurse and a colleague allegedly deposited the lower part of the foetus in the hospital’s mortuary. But doctors at another hospital later found the foetus head still in the womb, according to reports. The Hindustan Times said the nurse in the first hospital had pulled at a foetus so hard while attempting to deliver the baby that it broke into two parts. Reports said the dad claimed staff at the hospital didn’t inform him about the horric birth said to have happened on January . While medics in the second hospital, the Ummed Hospital in Jodhpur, were carrying out an operation to remove what they thought would be the placenta, they found the head, it is reported.   Doctors there reportedly informed the woman’s relatives and the family members about what theyd discovered. The mother is now believed to be fighting for her le in hospital. A criminal case has been registered against the two male nurses allegedly involved but police are yet to arrest them.

It can be a dficult market.“Competing with national chains and well-established pubs is a tough task.”Elysia, who has been in the licensed trade for more than six years, said it was harder for city centre pubs to compete.She added: “It would certainly be very challenging for a start-up pub to go into town.“Pubs can still play an important part in the community.“We’ve got a darts team in the pub and are in the process of starting a football team as well.“The older generation maybe lost a bit of that when the Whitfield Club closed its doors.“We now have a Tuesday Club which is mega busy – it’s a great place for them to meet up.”Meanwhile licensee Dale Nelson reopened the Airlie Arms this month.The -year-old has been working in licensed premises since he was .Despite the fact the bar on Dundonald Street had been shut for several months, Dale believes there is potential to turn its fortunes around.He said: “There are a lot of pubs in the city centre, the market is quite saturated.“We felt there was potential here based on the level of housing.“There are two football teams in the local area which bring in a good footfall.“We had Partick Thistle fans in here last week who had visited the VA.“I believe city centre landmarks could have a positive impact on the surrounding areas.”Dale added: “There is a small team here working to make a go of this pub.”David Glass, president of Dundee Licensed Trade Association, said pubs were still a “cornerstone” of local communities.He added: “There is definitely a feel-good factor in Dundee.“People have said there are too many hotels but these companies don’t come into a city on a whim.”David, who has owned Doc Ferry’s in Broughty Ferry since , said: “The pub is still a cornerstone of society, especially in local communities.“There is no denying businesses have maybe had their fingers burned in the past, not realising the scale of what they’ve got themselves into.“The days of someone coming in and owning a pub and leaving others to run it have probably gone now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee clinch signing of ex ross county skipper andrew davies","story":"Dundee have clinched the signing of Andrew Davies.The centre-half joins the club on an -month deal.Dundee boss Jim McIntyre knows the -year-old very well having spent time together at Ross County.

They’re fantastic because they’re usually quite green.“It’s been a great response from the local community.”Despite the fact the goats don’t eat the wood of the trees, Sarah manages to find a use for it, whether it be for kindling for her wood burner, or passing it on to a lady in the village who makes wooden children’s toys.She said: “Every part of the trees I get is used in some way.“The things I can’t burn, I put out the back to rot for the insects.

There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr. The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top-marks-for-peebles-dance-school","story":"A PEEBLES dance school is celebrating after achieving its best-ever exam results.

So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart.

Would he still be playinghe had not put his body through quite so much punishment Ivan Lendl, under whom Murray won all his biggest inidual titles, was the only coach able to consistently ramp up his chargersquos aggression, while tempering the Scotrsquos tendency to allow negativity to overwhelm him.It was no surprise Murray struggled to keep believing when always standing in his way were three of the all-time greats. Four times he lost in slam finals, twice to Djokovic and twice to Federer, before finally breaking his duck in appropriately gruelling fashion against Djokovic at the US Open in .The following summer came his career-defining moment when he ended Britainrsquos -year wait for a male singles champion at Wimbledon, adding a second title three years later then writing his own piece of history by becoming the first tennis player to win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in singles.In the autumn of , with his rivals at last showing some weakness, Murray surged thrillingly to the top of the rankings, clinching the number one spot by winning the ATP Finals in London.What seemed like it might be the start of the Murray era turned out instead to be a glorious swansong. Barely six months later, the first signs of his hip problem emerged and, despite surgery and an extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning programme, there has been no way back to the top.Perhaps even more important than his achievements on the court, the understated Murray emerged as one of the sportrsquos great trend-setters.First there was Murrayrsquos realisation in his early twenties that, rather than just employing a coach, having a team of people around him would help him reach his peak physically and mentally.Then, with a grand slam title still tantalisingly elusive, he reached out to a former great in Lendl, establishing the trend of the super coach. When their partnership came to an end, Murray broke more ground by hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who became the most high-profile female coach in tennis.Most top sportsmen would rather not stick their head above the parapet but, once he became comfortable in the limelight, Murray swam against the tide, speaking out forcefully on issues like equality and doping.He also embraced his role as the figurehead of British tennis, actively supporting and encouraging those emerging in his wake. They could not have bigger shoes to fill."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs should come back from their constituencies and prepare for coalition","story":"But this New Year theres only one forecast that really matters: what will happen with Brexit  As in a war, Brexit will crowd everything off the political agenda in . Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"is-jermain-defoe-past-it-heres-what-the-stats-say","story":"Celtic have already brought in Oliver Burke and Timothy Weah on loan and are seriously interested in Ivorian striker Vakoun Issouf Bayo. At the other side of Glasgow, Rangers have signed Kilmarnockrsquos Jordan Jones and Dundeersquos Glen Kamara on pre-contracts and have brought in Steven Davis and Jermain Defoe to help with their title tilt this season.:Write off a silverware hungry Jermain Defoe at your peril, says Rangers boss Steven GerrardDefoersquos move has been arguably the most eye-catching signing in the Premiership so far in January and has sparked debate over whether or not the -year-old still has what it takes to compete at this level. Wersquove decided to take a look at the Englishmanrsquos stats to see exactly what Rangers fans can expect from their new man.Defoe has always been seen as a natural goalscorer and with  goals in the English Premier League itrsquos not hard to see why. The ex-Spurs striker is the seventh-highest goalscorer in the competitionrsquos history and has spent almost the entirety of his career in Englandrsquos top flight.The graphic above charts Defoersquos goals per  minutes in league football since the   season and the results make for impressive reading. Even during the forwardrsquos worst season in front of goal, in  , he was still averaging . goals per  mins, or around a goal every four gamesyoursquod prefer. This is hardly prolic, of course, but it isnrsquot a poorin such a demanding league.:The Bulletin: Gerrard Further signings depend on moving players on | Hibernian keen on Lewis MorganPerhaps unsurprisingly, Defoersquos best goalscoring campaign came in the   season when he was playing for MLS side Toronto but of the  seasons hersquos spent in Englandrsquos top flight, Defoe has averaged more than a goal every two games on seven occasions. Even as recently as  , the forward was scoring . goals per  - a figure not to be snfed at.By analysing Defoersquos scoring rate over the last  seasons, we can see that there are peaks and troughs but - much to the encouragement of Rangers fans - there is no sustained period of clear decline. Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season.

Having bonded with Cave and guitarist Roland S Howard, this time Reekie made sure he had his camera.More than three decades on, some of the photographs he took that night and over the next few years in London and Berlin can be seen for the first time in Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn, Reekiersquos -page zine-like collection belatedly launched next weekend at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.ldquoLooking at the pictures again brought a lot back to me, says Reekie. ldquoI can remember the chaos and the aggression of the shows, but not any aggression in the people. I was really surprised to find everyone in The Birthday Party was so articulate, well-read and literate, and yet onstage it was almost like everything was stripped away to the most basic bones of absolute nihilism, and almost hatred for the audience. They got into a lot of fights that I witnessed, but after the show once things had calmed down, they relaxed with a bottle of bourbon, and you could chat with them about James Joyce or Dostoyevsky.The idea for Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn came after Reekie put some of his hitherto unseen archive on social media, and was approached to contribute to an exhibition in Los Angeles called Nick Cave Smoking. Reekie submitted four prints, one of which sold for . As Reekie puts it, ldquoIf someone in LArsquos willing to pay that for something Irsquove just got lying in the cupboard, maybe I should think about doing something.ldquoIrsquove always thought of doing an exhibition of my archive, but never got round to it. The book has already travelled as far afield as America, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Scandinavia and Canada. Itrsquos never going to make me a millionaire, but I feel quite validated by that.Reekiersquos images capture an unguarded sense of ease amongst Cave and co, with the band captured backstage making their own mark on the back of a torn-down Sad Cafeacute poster. Despite a strung-out demeanour that foresaw the self-destructive effects that heroin would have on the band, there is a sense of camaraderie at play, with Cave and Howard in particular looking like brothers in arms. It was a bonding perhaps caused by the absence of bassist Tracey Pew, who was serving a prison sentence. This necessitated Howardrsquos brother Harry stepping in.ldquoIt was chaotic, says Reekie. ldquoHarry had never played onstage before, and you could tell that Mick Harvey, as the only non-drug taker in the band, was trying to keep everything together.Later images reveal a haunted-looking Howard captured with his post Birthday Party band, These Immortal Souls. Elsewhere, a now solo Cave looks increasingly messianic. While Pew was dead by the end of  and Howard passed away in , one of Reekiersquos fondest moments is of offering Howard, his then partner Genevieve McGuckin and These Immortal Souls a bed in his flat following an Edinburgh gig.ldquoI went through to take Roland and Genevieve tea in the morning,rsquo says Reekie, ldquoand they were both sitting up wearing matching silk pyjamas, and were so polite in a way that no Birthday Party fan would believe.Sadly, no pictures of this myth-busting incident were taken.While he continued to take photographs, Reekie went on to become a music journalist of note, writing for Esquire, GQ and Loaded after that side of his career was kicked off in s Scottish music magazine Cut. The cover image of Reekiersquos book was taken in the Groucho Club, where Cave held court about his newly published novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel.ldquoThat was my first cover feature for Cut, Reekie remembers. ldquoI wanted to do the photographs for it as well, but they got Gavin Evans to do them.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn is the first in an occasional series of photobooks produced by Stereogram Recordings, which have released albums by the likes of The Eastern Swell, James King and The Lonewolves and The Cathode Ray. It is also the latest example of an ongoing unearthing of photographic archives from a pre-digital age that document often hidden histories of the post-punk era.This came to prominence in  with What Presence!, an exhibition and book of lost images by Glasgow-based former Sounds photographer Harry Papadopoulos. Produced by Street Level, What Presence! featured images of the Sound of Young Scotland era of bands, including Orange Juice, Altered Images and Fire Engines. Revealed! was a similarly styled document of the same era in Liverpool by Francesco Mellina, who photographed the likes of the late Pete Burnsrsquo band, Dead or Alive, and the post-punk scene based around Ericrsquos club.The Scene Inbetween and Untypical Girls are two volumes of DIY images taken of bands and fans in the s and s collated by Sam Knee, and which feature several images by Reekie. In a similar vein, former journalist turned AR man Ronnie Gurrrsquos Hanging Around Books has launched an ongoing series of booklets featuring never before seen seen images of the likes of Simple Minds and the Skids.As the age of the archive runs on, Reekie himself has thousands of photographic negatives in storage. These include shots of Edwyn Collins and Roddy Frame performing at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, and of Sonic Youthrsquos Kim Gordon alongside Lydia Lunch in their short-lived duo, Harry Crews.ldquoI reckon wersquove got enough to do another seven books, Reekie speculates. ldquoI could do one of early s club le in Edinburgh. Thatrsquos more about the people who were there rather than the bands, which might appeal to people of a certain vintage who were around then.It is this sense of empathy that makes Sometimes Severed Heads Must Burn such a crucial document of its era.ldquoItrsquos a step back in time, says Reekie, ldquoand because itrsquos all fly on the wall stuff, you can see therersquos a trust there, which the people in the pictures didnrsquot have with a lot of people at that time.

This is a government that has done its level best to curtail debate, to withhold information from this House and even had the courts compel them to allow us to have a vote on leaving the EU.ldquoIt was only successive votes of this House that got them to reveal vital information about their Brexit deal. Itrsquos a government that has been found in contempt of Parliament. Itrsquos absolutely right they are stopped.Mr Wishart commended the Speaker for putting the rights of MPs first and warned ministers: ldquoIf this Government wants Government versus Parliament, it will be on the losing side because we are now in the majority.In response, Ms Leadsom stressed how it was the Speakers role to \"uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself, not to arbitrarily change those rules\".She explained that yesterday was not about Parliament taking back control but, rather, about a number of MPs, who had tried to put amendments to the business motion and were told it was unamendable and undebatable.ldquoThe role of the chair is to uphold the rules that Parliament has made for itself not to arbitrarily change those rules. So, yesterday was not an example of Parliament taking back control, it was an example of a dferentiation between those members who were told that it was unamendable and undebatable, and those who were told dferently.\"Mr Bercow then intervened to declare: \"There was nothing arbitrary about the conduct of the chair yesterday.\"This Speaker is well aware of how to go about the business of chairing the proceedings of the House because hes been doing so for nine and a half years.\"I hope colleagues will understand when I say that I require no lessons or lectures from others about how to discharge my obligations to Parliament and in support of the rights of backbench parliamentarians.\"The Speaker added: \"I have been doing it, Im continuing to do it and I will go on doing it, no matter how much abuse I get from whatever quarter its water off a ducks back as far as I am concerned.\"He piped up again after Mrs Leadsom reiterated that she was advised that the controversial amendment by her Conservative colleague Dominic Grieve \"would not be selectable\".The Speaker intervened a second time to stress that it was his responsibility as chair to select amendments.\"It is a matter for the representative and champion of Parliament, it is not a matter for a representative of the executive branch, who is the executives representative in the chamber of the House of Commons. Ill do my job and other people can seek to do theirs,\" he insisted.Earlier, Ms Leadsom confirmed the Government would abide by Mr Grieves amendment, which asks it to outline a revised Brexit plan within three sitting daysthe PMs deal were defeated. The normal process, as outlined in law, requires a statement within  days of the deal being rejected and a motion being tabled within seven days thereafter.\"Of course the Government will do so, the Prime Minister has shown her willingness to alwaysto this House, at the first possible opportunity,there is anything to report in terms of our deal and we will continue to do so,\" added the Commons Leader.Because the House is not sitting next Friday, then the deadline for Mrs May to make a statement on a Plan B would be Monday January . Her statement is likely to be made on this day with a debate and vote following in that week.The Governmentrsquos understanding of the Grieve amendment is that this debate would last only  minutes and only one amendment could be submitted. However, given the strength of feeling on the Brexit issue, MPs are likely to object to a debate lasting only  minutes. As has been seen this week, the Speaker could determine to interpret matters in a dferent way and allow MPs a much longer debate."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-admits-delaying-brexit-day-a-possibility-if-labour-forces-general-election","story":"The Labour leader conceded that extending the Article  process, which stipulates the date of exit day, ldquowould be a possibilityhellipbecause of the practicalities of negotiating a new deal with Brussels.In a keynote speech, Mr Corbyn confirmed his party would seek to vote down Theresa Mays Brexit Plan next Tuesday and at some point thereafter call a confidence vote in her Government,she lost, in the hope of forcing a general election.:Speaker Bercow clashes again with Cabinet minister over parliamentary procedure on BrexitHe dismissed the Governments offer to consider new safeguards for workers as part of the Brexit package, backing a trade union assessment that \"it simply doesnt guarantee the protections that we are seeking\".The Labour leader confirmed that Labour would go into any early election on a  of opening new negotiations with Brussels on a Brexit deal involving a customs union, single market relationship and a guarantee to keep pace with EU rights and standards.He explained how \"time\" would be needed to complete these talks.Mr Corbyn insisted there was \"no split\" between him and his Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who on Wednesday suggested an extension of the two-year period for negotiations set out in Article  of the EU treaties might now be \"inevitable\".Askedhe agreed, the party leader said: \"Quite clearly, moving into office at a period right up against the clock, there would need to be time for that negotiation.\"What Keir was doing was reflecting the practicalities of how that negotiation would be undertakenhellipAn extension would be a possibility because clearly there would have to be time to negotiate.\"But the SNPrsquos Stephen Gethins called on the Labour leader to end the ldquopolitical posturing and work with other parties to break the Brexit deadlock and ldquosupport a second EU referendum.Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed the point, saying: ldquoWe have no confidence in this Conservative Government but neither do we have any confidence in Mr Corbyn.:Nicola Sturgeon faces grilling at FMQs over Alex Salmond investigationldquoIn the public interest, he needs to get  per cent behind a Peoplersquos Vote, including the option to remain in the EU.Speaking to party supporters in Wakefield in West Yorkshire, the Leader of the Opposition said a general election was the most \"practical\" and \"democratic\" way to \"break the deadlock\" in Parliament over BrexitHe said: \"If the Government cannot pass its most important legislation, then there must be a general election at the earliest opportunity.\"A government that cannot get its business through the House of Commons is no government at all.

She was over on the cradle and she was being pulled out the water.ldquoWe were examining how the hull and the bow were on the cradle, and all of a sudden there was a loud noise. I had my back turned to it, so I didnrsquot exactly see what happened, but she ended up being pulled back into the water with the cradle.Mr Beveridge spoke of his relief that nobody was seriously injured.ldquoNobodyrsquos been hurt, which is great, and wersquove managed to secure the ship and shersquos back in her berth at the pier, he said.ldquoWe now need to find out whatrsquos gone wrong.

We have the pound million still to spend and getting her out of the water and examining the hull was just a small fraction of that money, so the majority of the money will still be spent on refurbishing the ship, doing up the engines [and] getting them working again with the steam.ldquoBut then wersquoll have to find out whatrsquos happened and make an assessment. At this moment in time we just donrsquot know.Asked when another attempt might be made to haul the vessel on to the slip, Mr Beveridge said: ldquoIt wonrsquot be in the next few days [trying again].ldquoWersquoll have to assess what went wrong and then see where we go from there.

There has been much written about John Beatonrsquos performance at Ibrox, much of which I do not wish to go into here, just as I do not want to talk about the inexcusable reports about the alleged threats made towards the referee according to Police Scotland.However, the fallout from the game at Ibrox and the questions surrounding the lack of clarity over punishments in Scottish football, in general, has left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans that not even a few glasses of prosecco at New Year could wash away.Something has to give.:Chris Sutton:online pub pics are valid then John Beaton guilty of \"sheer stupidity\"The Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but that of the International Football Association Boardwith such  being installed across the world to make sure the laws and protocolsof the game are followed. However, the lack of transparency in the process is the fault of the SFA. While there are good intentions in the creation of a , the lack of scrutiny given to fans must change for the good of the game.Itrsquos only January but I have now lost count of the number of clubs that have come out and slammed the shocking standards of referees and the lsquostrangersquo outcomes from the compliance board. The SFA are pulling the wool over fans eyesthey think that this abysmal standard of governing can continue. Supporters are being let down on the pitch and then assured justice will be served by the much-derided compliance group behind an Oz-like veil that is even less rewarding than following the Yellow Brick Road.But rather than admitting there is a problem and trying to tackle it, the SFA are hoping that this all blows over.And it is their hubris that is preventing the standards of our game from improving.How often have we seen a manager fined for an offence in an interview or a player sent off for a kick only to have a similar incident a week later with no repercussions Itrsquos almost asthe Judicial Panel consists of three lsquoexpertsrsquo asking a Magic  ball and hoping for the best.Can you name any other industry were such major inconsistencies would go unaddressed  Rather than coming up with a fix, the SFA seem to just want to head to the Winchester for a nice cold pint and hope it all blows over.As said previously, the Judicial Panel is not the brainchild of the SFA but admitting that its rollout in Scotland hasnrsquot been as smooth as desired would go a long way with supporters. In my opinion, there is an easy fix. Whatrsquos to stop the findings of the  and the evidence used in a review being published once the case is over  Is there a reason that referee and supervisor reports and marks awarded arenrsquot published after every game While these arenrsquot monumental changes they would certainly help in giving fans a deserved insight into our officials and provide clarity on certain issues.:Celtic hit out at SFA - and call on referee John Beaton to explain Alfredo Morelos decisions at IbroxI canrsquot imagine managers and chairman disagreeing with knowing exactly what chance they have of having a punishment upheld rescinded. So what is the problem in publishing all details of the case once it has concluded  It happens in the court of law, so why canrsquot it happen following a review within the chambers of Hampden Park Any fan can accept a decision going against their teamthey can see the evidence and see the rules of the game are applied consistently, but itrsquos the SFArsquos constant desire to lsquopick and choosersquo when to punish managers and players that irritates so many. Somewhere in the process, something is going wrong, and it needs to be investigated.By being open with reviews and how rules are applied, fans would finally have insight into the whole process. Yes, some would disagree with it but at least they could see the evidence and justication into why such a decision was made.Fans and even some clubs have suggested a review of the governing body for a number of years now, but their calls have been largely ignored. Enough clubs have been critical of decisions this year to surely warrant one or at least to ask why an investigation hasnrsquot been launched The inconsistency of fines and suspensions has to stop. The picking and choosing of rules to applymust end. Hiding behind statements cannot and will not bring about real change.The SFAs inconsistent approach and weak governance is systematically destroying the game and promoting claims of bias at the very top.What harm could possibly come from a little more transparency in the game  What is there to hide Something needs to change, andthis column gets at least one more person calling for a review of the game and the inept governing body then my job has been done.

Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Friday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is crucial that all political parties use the upcoming budget negotiations to correct our country’s course.Just over a year from the passing of the Child PovertyAct and following the damning assessment of poverty in the UK from the United Nations’ Rapporteur, we had high hopes of the draft Budget.The Scottish Government has made tackling poverty a top priority, but platitudes and promises are not always making the transition into real, funded policy to transform people’s lives. Rhetoric does not help youyou are trying to decide whether you can afford to take a bus to work or pay for your child’s lunch.While ministers are right to restate their commitment to building more affordable homes, expanding childcare and helping parents into the workplace, we will not solve poverty merely with reannouncements of existing policy.It’s unacceptable so many children are living in poverty in Scotland – and the forthcoming Budget negotiations must right that wrong.Living in poverty can affect every aspect of family le. In the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report into poverty, we spoke to a single mother, Hazel, in Fe who is a care assistant with two teenage children.She told us: “If I compare things to an object it would be a hamster’s wheel. No matter how hard I work and how much I push myself, I still feel I am getting nowhere.”Too many families in poverty are faced with impossible choices, balancing paying the rent with the cost of childcare and being able to get to work, as essential costs rise. Every decision is finely balanced – do you buy fresh food or put the heating on  Everywhere they look, families can be restricted and restrained by poverty – but we know it can and must be solved.: One in four children living in poverty as childcare woes and disabilities biteOpposition parties will now play a key role in shaping the final Budget put before Holyrood and together, the parties must ensure the proposals avoid a step back in its fight against poverty.The Scottish Government now has an increasing range of choices about how it raises and spends money. But local government delivers critical support for low-income families, such as housing provision, local bus services and out-of-school care. To keep these families from being swept into poverty, they need adequate funding. Councils have been faced with continually squeezed budgets for day-to-day spending on existing services with little,any, recourse to tax-raising powers.Council tax reform will rightly be a key area of the budget negotiations. Currently, our evidence shows that falling behind with council tax, and harsh recovery of the money that is owed, is one of the key causes of destitution – where people regularly lack the ability to keep a roof over their head, feed themselves and keep dry and clean. Any reform to the system must ensure that there is a proper anchor for low-income households in dficulty so that they all receive the support they need.There are steps ministers can take now to ease the strain on household budgets. First of all, a quick and much-needed fix would be to increase the thresholds for the council tax reduction scheme in Scotland. This would ensure that working families in poverty are able to keep more of what they earn before they are asked to pay towards their council tax. Doing so could buy the Scottish Government and partners the time they need to develop and implement long-term reforms.: Gordon Brown warns of growing child poverty crisisSecondly, social security is another key tool that the Scottish Government can use to loosen the grip of poverty, and families should not have to wait until  for the income supplement to be paid. We would like serious consideration of delivery of an interim solution that is fully funded by Scottish Government but paid locally, using the expertise of councils in this area. As well as helping people who desperately need a step up now, it would provide genuine insight and learning before permanent rollout in .Finally, our labour market is not working for hundreds of thousands of Scots. There is much that Scotland’s business owners and managers can do to get the best out of their workforce by providing compassion, flexibility and security to allow people to build a le free from poverty. But fair work requires a supporting infrastructure that the Scottish Government must do more to provide.To make progress on labour market equality for women at work and boost their incomes requires further targeted investment in accessible, affordable and flexible childcare that can respond to the realities of the local jobs market, particularly in lower wage sectors. More investment in employability services is vital in breaking down physical and mental barriers, especially for those with long-term health conditions or disability. The Scottish Government also needs to look seriously at whether transport systems and concessions support those who need help the most.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"mondays ferry sailings likely to be disrupted ","story":"Rough or very rough seas, as well as gales, are forecast and a yellow #be prepared# warning has been issued by the Met office.NorthLink says further updates will follow as forecasts are updated.Shetland Islands Council has also warned that inter-island ferries may be disrupted..."},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27502  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“The Taoiseach#s problem is that he doesn#t like the democratic choice of the people of #those constituencies# and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Féin#s participation.” - Mary Lou McDonald TDSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has hit out at Taoiseach Leo Varadkar after he demanded that Sinn Féin MPs resign from their Westminster seats.The Taoiseach made the statement earlier today, claiming that the upcoming week is crucial for Tory leader Theresa May.“If Sinn Féin feel they got elected on the basis of abstentionist then they have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster,\" he said.In a response, the Sinn Féin President branded the Taoiseach’s comments as “absolutely ludicrous\" stating that “Sinn Féin have no intention of standing aside and abandoning our mandate.”Speaking to An Phoblacht, the Dublin Central TD said: “The Taoiseachs problem is that he doesnt like the democratic choice of the people of those constituencies and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Féins participation.”“Fine Gael, and Fianna Fáil for that matter, should put to the people their willingness to take seats in Westminster and to swearing an oath to a foreign power and let the people decide,” she said.In the  Westminster election, Nationalist voters turned their back on Westminster increasing Sinn Féins representation by more than double, while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil continue to abstain from political le in the north."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27503  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“The international community has a responsibility to support the Palestinian people and challenge the continuing human rights abuses of Israel. - Aileen MellonSolidarity demonstrations were held across Ireland last night in support of the people of Palestine. Demonstrations were held from Derry to Cork, organised by Sinn Féin, to mark International Day of Solidarity with Palestine. In Belfast, the demonstrations was held outside the headquarters of the BBC and called on the media to pay more attention to the plight of the Palestinian people. Speaking at the rally, Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan said: \"In the last four months dozens of people have been slaughtered at the border to with Gaza.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉIN"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27513  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonFor its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.In the aftermath of her election as Uachtarán Shinn Féin, Mary Lou MacDonald, reaffirmed our party’s practical solidarity with the people of Palestine as a key international priority.I communicated this to the very broad cross section of Palestinian political opinion with which Sinn Féin maintains direct contact.As a result the Palestinian Legislative Council , which is Palestine’s elected parliament, issued an official invitation to Mary Lou and a leadership delegation to visit Palestine.In accepting this honour we asked the PLC to host a programme which would allow for engagement with all sections of Palestinian political and civic society, including all the main political forces.So in mid-December  a Party delegation, led by Mary Lou, including Pat Sheehan, Ciarán Quinn and myself, travelled to the occupied West Bank for five days.The PLC extended us every diplomatic courtesy and assistance during our trip including help to arrange a formal meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas the laying of a wreath at the tomb of Yasser Arafat by Mary Lou and, a tour of the Yasser Arafat museum.Our inclusive programme began with a meeting hosted in the Jordanian parliament in Amman by the Chair of its Palestine Committee, Yahya Al-Saud, before travelling directly to our first meeting in the West Bank, with Jonathon Conlan and Declan Johnston, the Irish government representatives in Palestine. Importantly, the government has just increased Ireland’s aid budget by two million euros – at a time when the US administration has slashed its contribution to the United NationsRelief and Works Agency.Over the next few days we met with all the political parties elected to the PLC women activists young people ex-prisoners political and human rights campaigners, including Boycott, Divestment and Sanction representatives local Councillors community groups and, media organisations.Throughout, we engaged extensively with all shades of political and civic opinion.We listened, learned, and made new friends.This trip came at a time of renewed political instability and conflict in the West Bank with increased Israeli military incursions and expanded settlement activity.An Israeli military lock down on Ramallah city was in place just days before we arrived.However, political disunity among the main Palestinian political forces has also intensied. Indeed it has probably deepened since ourto Ireland.Yet the importance of national political unity was spoken of by all the Palestinian representatives and citizens we encountered.The need for national reconciliation is the single most popular and urgent discussion within Palestinian society. That reality has found further expression in the launch since Christmas, of the new Palestinian National Democratic Assembly, which is an alliance including dferent progressive political and civic forces and personalities.We encouraged the pursuit of national unity among all Palestinians and reiterated Sinn Féin’s commitment to assist in whatever modest way we could to support that being achieved.A palpable anger exists among ordinary people throughout Palestine tempered with an absolute determination and resilience.Everyone we met, regardless of ideological and tactical dferences, is committed to popular resistance against the Israeli occupation.Nasser Al-Laham is the managing director of Maan news agency. He hosted us at his offices in Bethlehem six days before Christmas.Nasser is a former political prisoner who served  years. He’s one of the estimated one in five Palestinians who have been imprisoned since .The experience of prison and detention is prolic within Palestinian society.The Nakba of , when almost one million Palestinians were driven from their homes in historic Palestine to become permanent refugees, permeates every aspect of their historic and present day existence.Their collective, lived reality is one of colonialism, death, detention, discrimination and denial of rights.Nasser said evocatively“The Palestinian people are not violent people, they are angry people.”Just a few hours earlier we had walked around Jerusalem.While there we met Adnan Ghaith. He is the Governor of Jerusalem. He too is a former political prisoner, but is banned under Israeli military law in Jerusalem from visiting his office or carrying out official duties.Afterwards we went to Al-Esawiah, a neighbourhood on the edge of the city.A population of , live in this poor area, and,  political prisoners from there are being held in Israeli jails.From early that same day Israeli troops closed off its narrow, winding streets with ‘flying checkpoints’, carrying out searches and making arrests.These were familiar scenes to me.We were in the local community based Ambulance and Emergency Aid Association when Ahmed joined our company.Two years previously, when he was aged just , Israeli soldiers shot him in the right eye while he visited the shops.Afterwards we all walked outside as we did so three of Ahmed’s buddies, of around the same age, came over for a yarn. One of them had also been shot in the eye, as he ed from school.I shuddered when we were then told - a total of  residents from Al-Esawiah have been shot in the eyes.I felt inadequate. I had nothing useful to say.The previous day in Ramallah during a very emotional meeting with ex-prisoners from all political backgrounds two  year-old boys were introduced with their parents.Shadi and Ahmad had just been released from prison two weeks earlier. They were jailed at the age of , sentenced to three years each, and detained in inhumane conditions.I imagined how I’d feelthese were my sons.Meeting these four young teenagers was an unforgettable and moving experience.On the morning of our last day we visited the Tamimi family in their home at Nabil Saleh.Ahed is the -year-old girl who was imprisoned earlier this year for slapping an Israeli soldier.Her daddy Bassem said that although the nearest beach is only  km away, the nature of Israeli restrictions on Palestinians’ movements in the West Bank meant Ahed’s first experience of a beach was on a recent trip to Spain.The occupation of the West Bank, Jerusalem and siege of Gaza have had a devastating impact on the lives of Palestinian children and youth. The percentage of young people aged between  –  years in Palestine comprises % of the total population.Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiativehas said that for him and many others in his generation, childhood ended on  June  when the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza were occupied by Israel.The Israeli occupation has robbed Palestinian youth of their childhoods up to and including the present generation.The one fundamental question which the international community must address is what future can Palestinian children expect under the conditions of this five decades old occupation The Israeli settlement policy remains central to the occupation despite the fact that international law as provided under the Geneva Convention, prohibits an occupying power from resettling its own population on occupied territory.Palestinian family homes are systematically demolished alongside a relentless seizure of property, natural resources, water, crops and arable land to make way for new settlements.An eight-metre high wall, which is nearly  miles long, provides an apartheid cordon through the West Bank serviced by a ‘settlers only’ exclusive roads system.This system is reinforced by a network of permanent and ‘flying’ check points.The occupation has been designed, and is being strategically enforced based upon a form of scientic military precision which has no international parallel.Currently , settlers now occupy vast and expanding tracts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.In the early hours of Christmas morning, settlers protected by Israeli forces began the annexation of Battir, a UNESCO World Heritage site, by putting a caravan in position to stake a claim on that land.On New Year’s Eve, Gideon Levy, the acclaimed Israeli journalist and commentator observed that things in Palestine may appear frozen in time as the occupation continued without impediment.Then he wrote“It would be a grave mistake however, to think that everything stayed the same . There is nothing status quo about occupation or apartheid, evenit sometimes seems that way.”Levy states that the Israeli state has sought to make the colonial settlement programme an irreversible reality.During  a new phase of this strategy began by putting a legislative infrastructure in place, to entrench within Israeli law the aim of the settlements: that is, to prevent any possibility of a viable Palestinian state existing within the territories occupied in , and to block the potential for the two-state solution ever succeeding.Other laws have been adopted which aim to neutralise any opposition from inside Israeli society, and enforce absolute loyalty to the state.Legislative cover has now been enacted for the daily annexation of the Palestinian territories and seizure of Palestinian land and homes, to enable the relentless expansion of the Israeli state borders beyond those established in .When the Oslo Agreement was signed in  the extent of the compromises made by Palestinians were considered highly contentious both at the time and since. Now the overwhelming view in Palestine is that Oslo is dead.From the outset Israel usurped the terms of that agreement and then acted to hollow out the integrity of the resultant Palestinian Authorityto the extent that many in Palestinian society now suggest the only symbol of sovereignty in the PA is the Palestinian national flag.There is a deep, visceral resentment at the attempts to eradicate the Palestinian national identity, culture and history. This goes to the very crux of why the status of Jerusalem is such a totemic issue for the Palestinian people.The current situation in the occupied territories is rapidly deteriorating.The scale and effects of the repression being inflicted is beyond the comprehension of all reasonable people.Last year alone, Israeli army forces killed  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, according to a statement from the Abdullah Harani Centre on nd January.The number of Palestinians killed has increased by % in .These figures include  children and three women. were reportedly killed in Gaza and  others in the occupied West Bank.A total of , were injured in Gaza and  others in the West Bank by Israeli Army gunfire.The Addameer Association reported in December  that a total of , political prisoners are currently being detained by Israel. Of these  are being held under administrative detention  are women and,  are children, of whom  are aged under  years.The ongoing occupation of Palestine is the most enduring political, humanitarian, existential crisis of our modern times. And yet, all this continues to happen in direct violation of international law, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and successive UN resolutions.The international community and all its institutions have abjectly failed the Palestinian people. By failing to act in defence of Palestinian rights it has acquiesced in their occupation and repression.The international community needs to become outraged at the violation of universal human rights which is taking place.The Palestinians need more than diplomatic noise or sympathy. They demand action.International law must be enforced.The international community must act in the way it ultimately mobilised against South African apartheid.A new, decisive, international initiative on Palestine is demanded from the UN, European Union , and international governments and agencies, in spite of the Israeli and US administrations’ pressure not to do so.The Irish Government should give leadership, within the EU, by recognising the state of Palestine and supporting the passage of the Occupied Territories’ Bill early in .The legitimate mandate of all Palestinian political parties should be recognised by the EU.The politics of exclusion and policies of non-engagement have always failed.However, Palestinian political leaders can give a powerful mandate for such a step change in policy and action from the international community by speaking with one united voice, and by agreeing common strategic and political positions.National unity among all of the political forces under the representative leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisationis essential to ensure that agreed and effective national resistance strategies are developed against the occupation.That would surely give renewed impetus, inspiration and hope to Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, in the refugee camps, and throughout the diaspora.Palestinian political prisoners inside the prisons have in the past shown that dialogue to secure unity can be successful.Of course it is a first principle that only the Palestinian people and their political leaders can determine the direction of their struggle. Others can only offer and share fraternal and comradely advice.But it is clear, that what has not been achieved or attempted to date is the integration of mutually reinforcing international and domestic strategies of diplomatic pressure and popular political resistance to end the occupation.As  begins this may well be an opportunity for a new, bold initiative by all the Palestinian leaders to reaffirm and renew the representative leadership role of the PLO as the fully inclusive authority of the Palestinian national liberation struggle and to also build a definitive consensus on the core national and democratic principles and objectives, which subordinates ideological and tactical dferences to the achievement of a viable Palestinian state.Essential to any progress will be the international community and Palestine has many friends across the globe.So consideration should be given to convening an appropriate international forum under the auspices of the PLO which draws together all international authorities, agencies, and fraternal political parties which have acted in good faith towards Palestinian interests and, to mandate their representatives to take responsibility for the implementation of a newly defined international initiative, premised upon invoking and enforcing international law, and for the mobilisation of a global political momentum against the injustice of the occupation which mirrors the global campaign against apartheid in South Africa.For its part, Sinn Féin will continue to be an honest friend, committed to the cause of Palestine, and to working in cooperation with all Palestinian political and civic leaders in pursuit of national reconciliation, and the achievement of Palestinian national and democratic objectives.The ordinary people of Palestine deserve nothing less.In the words of Adnan Ghaith, the Governor of Jerusalem“The Palestinian people deserve to live their lives like any other people.”Free Palestine!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8760014.1546853768!/image/image.jpg","title":"traffic and travel delays after collision approaching co antrim roundabout","story":"Motorists are being warned to expect delays after a collision approaching the Seven Towers roundabout in Ballymena.A post on TrafficwatchNI said: \"#CoAntrim getting reports RTC #Ballymena approaching A Seven Towers R`bout - expect delaysin the area\".Traffic jamA later post said: A delays from #Antrim direction - Ballee Roundabout towards Ballymena - road down to one lane while vehicle waits for recovery.NI Kegworth survivor: I could hear Stf Little Fingers in coma but just couldn’t come out of it Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

Voting began with the opening episode that aired on Tuesday, and John’s performances will be fully broadcast on Tuesday th.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, John said the show was a massive career opportunity.“It’s more exposure than anything,” he said.“It’s a TG show, which is mainly down south, and it’s good coverage because I want to break into the south in a way. This TV show will be a great  to get my name out there and to get heard. “It’s crazy. I’m a big fan of Johnny Brady, he’s super singer and the band that he’s working with are super talented, so to get to work with him is amazing.”He continued: “It has been really good. It was hard getting used to the TV cameras and being involved in the whole makeup thing, but it’s good craic. I was getting slegged about the makeup the whole day, but it was good craic. It’s all part and parcel of the show. “The whole experience has been phenomenal. You really feel like a star in the way that they treat you.”No stranger to competition, John is a three-time winner of our own Best of the West contest, but he insists he is not overly concerned about a victory on this occasion. However, he admits that it“would be a big bonus” and is asking the people of Belfast to give him their support.“For me it’s about networking and the doors it could open,” he said. “There was a girl on last year called Chantelle Patton, she didn’t win it but she ended up in Nashville this year – that’s the kind doors it could open.“If local people support me it would be great. Even winning Best of the West three years in a row was crazy, it really takes you aback when people are voting for you. I would love a wee push on this one. It would be really much appreciated.

This year it was disconcerting to read disclosure of NIO briefings from  refer to friends and colleagues being named along with their organisations.The Committee on the Administration of Justice was the subject of one of the documents, a document we know was shared with MI and Task Coordinating Group. The human rights organisation was described as “biased” and Professor Kieron McEvoy in particular was singled out as being considered “strongly biased and opinionated”.The CAJ highlighted human rights abuses of actors to the conflict, and in particular the state, and were highlighting evident abuses and questioning the lack of remedy avenues for victims. That year the CAJ highlighted, amongst other issues, the signicant questions of state collusion in the killing of solicitor Pat Finucane in  and the summary executions of three men at Sean Graham’s Bookmakers at the bottom of the Whiterock.The questions they raised then have not gone away and that the CAJ and Professor McEvoy are still engaged in the intense efforts to secure remedy for victims of violations is no coincidence.The question of “unsympathetic opinion makers” in West Belfast also taxed the minds of NIO officials prompting them to make a note on people best avoided. Those people included Professors Mike Tomlinson and Bill Rolston and Father Des Wilson. The purpose of the memo was not to state the obvious, but to urge others not to talk to them or engage with their analysis. The memo includes reference to Glór na nGael, Falls Women’s Centre and the Divis Joint Development Committee.This was the era of political vetting. When those included in such memos were not just ostracised from conversations, but were denied access to funding, demonised in the media and ultimately branded as part of a “pan-nationalist front”. This policy was part of the wider militarised agenda of isolating a community, censoring its representatives, and denying community organisations legitimacy.That deliberate approach in turn allowed for wider justication of shoot to kill policies, the use of plastic and rubber bullets, torture and degrading and inhumane treatment of suspects in holding centres and those imprisoned. In  the end game policy of collusion with loyalism was well under way. Loyalists had been armed, provided with information on targets and given cover. Targeting of the nationalist and republican community was based on the distribution of military files, the use of state agents, and these types of briefings.Then Secretary of State Douglas Hurd MP stated that “some community groups, or persons prominent in the direction or management of some community groups, have sufficiently close links with paramilitary organisations to give rise to a grave risk that to give support to those groups would have the effect of improving the standing and furthering the aims of a paramilitary organisation, whether directly or indirectly”.The killing of John Devine, the previous year, whose business had been in Conway Mill, had clearly not mitigated the policy.In any truth process these briefings, their context, their outcomes and all who played the game should be the subject of intense scrutinywe are to really understand our conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"book reveals number of catholics in dup and uup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Majority of UUP members loathe DUP and dont want a merger \"In each party you could count the Catholic members on the fingers of your hand, but it will surprise many people that the DUP is ahead of the Ulster Unionists,\" Prof Tonge said.He said it was surprising that the UUP had no programme in place to attract Catholic unionists as most members would like a more religiously representative party. \"Both unionist parties are currently beyond the pale to Catholics,\" he added.Around , UUP members were interviewed by the authors.Prof Tonge said the party was considerably larger than the DUP, boosting a membership twice the size. However, while almost a third of DUP members claimed to be \"very active\", only one in five UUP members did.The partys strength was in Northern Irelands least populated county, Fermanagh, where around % of members lived compared to % of DUP members.Prof Tonge said the UUP urgently needed to recruit in the more heavily populated counties of Antrim and Down. He revealed that, contrary to popular myth, the UUP had recruited young people in recent years.\"Fteen per cent of its members joined in the last seven years. The party has been very successful in Queens and the Ulster University. Where it needs to do better is with ordinary, non-university young people,\" he said.The UUP boosts more women members than the DUP - its % male to the DUPs %. But Prof Tonge said the centralised nature of the DUP meant greater control over candidate selection by the leadership with women heavily promoted.\"The rise of Arlene Foster to become Northern Irelands first female leader is symbolic of the DUPs deliberate attempts to modernise the image of the party in the face of their unionist rivals,\" the book states. \"Whether Arlene Foster would have been able to rise through the ranks of the UUP will never be known, but is still a question worth asking.\"Although the partys politicians are increasingly liberal on the issue, only % of UUP members support same-sex marriage. However, % believe Northern Ireland should have the same abortion laws as Britain.Whereas Free Presbyterians are the largest denomination in the DUP, they account for just .% of the UUP, which is split almost evenly - % to % - between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. UUP members are religious with % attending church weekly, although thats lower than the DUPs %. Almost six in  would mind a religiously mixed marriage in the family a little or a lot.The Orange Orders influence in the party is on the wane. Only % of councillors are members compared to % in the DUP, and % of MLAs . Around % of both parties members are in the Orange Order. Just over half of UUP members would transfer to the DUP in elections. A third said they would give a lower preference to the SDLP and % to Sinn Fein. Once an integrationist party, the UUP is now very pro-devolution which has % membership support compared to % for direct rule."},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants planning northern ireland emergency fuel operations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem.

McGrady responded with a second point for Down, but Donegal piled on the agony and further scores from McGonigle, with a goal, Hugh McFadden and Oisin Gallen left the visitors comfortable winners.Down had late points from Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe, a member of the county U- squad last season, and Devlin, but they were mere consolation scores as Donegal ran out comfortable winners.Down: Jonathan Parr, Shane Annett, Ruairi Wells, Ryan McAleenan, Gerard Collins, Benny McArdle, Ryan Johnston , Aaron McClements, Daniel McCarthy, Rory Mason, Conor Poland, Jerome Johnston , Pat Havern , Ciaran Harney .Subs: Conor McGradyfor McArdle, Paul Devlinfor Mason, D McClements for Harney, Corey Quinn for Havern, Owen McCabefor Aaron McClements.Donegal: Martin McGinley, Caolan Ward, Brendan McCole, Conor Morrison, Eoin McHugh, Eamonn Doherty, Peadar Morgan , Hugh McFadden , Martin McElhinney , Ciaran Thompson , Niall OrsquoDonnell , Caolan McGonigle , Martin OrsquoReilly , Michael Langan , Jamie Brennan .Subs: Jason McGee for Thompson, Paul Brennan for McHugh, Lorcan Connor for Morrison, Oisin Gallenfor OrsquoReilly.Down -Donegal -McKENNA CUP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17288752.new-festive-driving-role-for-retired-bus-driver/resources/images/9270801.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

But meeting the cost of funding those additional student places will be problematic, a senior civil servant has warned.Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly said providing the extra student places could cost £ million a year – money that would have to come from cuts in other areas of the health service budget.He also pointed out that such a decision would have to be taken by an elected Stormont minister.The Department of Health today published the Report of the Review of Medical School Places in Northern Ireland along with the department’s initial response to the  main recommendations made in the review.Led by Professor Keith Gardiner, Chief Executive and Dean of the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency, the review was commissioned by the Department of Health to determine the optimum number of medical student places required in Northern Ireland.Mr Pengelly commented: “I very much welcome this review which provides a sound evidence base indicating the future level of medical education training that should be commissioned in Northern Ireland.“The  main recommendations set out in this report are challenging.“Medical education already involves signicant levels of funding. It is vital to maximise the impact on healthcare in Northern Ireland of the very signicant investment already being made in undergraduate medical education.”He continued: “The expansion in medical student numbers indicated by this report could cost up to an additional £m per year – funding which would have to be found by making reductions in other areas of the health service. “This report raises long term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications which will require decisions by Ministers. In the meantime, I have today set out the department’s initial view on the  recommendations of this report and indicated the actions that we will progress immediately.”Actions the department will progress include:• Developing measures to increase the attractiveness of Northern Ireland as a destination of choice for medical training and careers• Increasing the supply of Clinical Academics from the field of General PracticeNorthern Ireland teachers ‘worst paid in UK and the Republic’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• Working in conjunction with GP Federations to deliver enhanced levels of teaching and training in Primary Care settings• Publicising health and social care career options to young people from the age of • Promoting medical careers and seeking to increase the proportion of NI domiciles from under-served areas and• Developing policy options to link bursary support to a minimum “Return on Service” within the HSC.Currently, Northern Ireland’s only medical school is at Queen’s University Belfast.Ulster University’s proposed new graduate medical school at its Magee Campus in Londonderry would provide additional places for student doctors. However, the opening of the new facility has been put on hold due to the ongoing political impasse at Stormont.try catch            ..

Read full story - Expanding medical student places in NI could cost £m a year, department revealsCommenting on the findings of the review, Dr Tom Black said: “The recommendations in this report do not come as a surprise to the profession. We have said for some time now that a long term view needs to be taken when assessing numbers needed within the medical workforce.“As the report points out, training to become a doctor can take up to  years so while we fully support a new medical school in the north westand an increase in training places, that alone will not address our current issues.“The report points out that we need to do more to attract doctors from other parts of the UK to Northern Ireland.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

According to the latest Real Estate Outlook report from CBRE, there was take-up of , sq ft of office space across  transactions, in . It says that was more than double the figure a year earlier. Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged. The order for the Airbus A- jets – formerly Bombardier CSs before the firms agreed a tie-up – brings Delta’s order book to  planes. The latest deal could be worth as much as .bn, according to the book price. However its likely the sale price is signicantly less than that. The wings and signicant parts of the aircraft fuselage are made in Bombardier’s Belfast plant. \"Delta has always been deeply focused on the passenger experience, and the A fits perfectly with that philosophy,” Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer said. \"You just need to take a look at Delta’s cabin on the A to see it’s setting a new standard in short-haul flying. The A will provide passengers with a level of comfort and convenience that makes flying a pleasure again, while meeting Delta’s high standards for efficiency and reliability.” Gil West, Delta’s chief operating officer, said: “These additional A aircraft will continue to strategically enable Delta to refresh our fleet, drive further advances in the customer experience and serve as an excellent investment for our customers, employees and shareowners for Delta into the next decade. “We look forward to taking our first A- in  at the Airbus assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
