If his cars had been based on aluminium-air fuel cells, the outcome might have been different.\u0027Ironically, Jackson\u0027s story so far bears more than a passing resemblance to Dyson\u0027s.Dyson developed his bagless vacuum cleaner at a workshop at his home, supported by his wife.And just as Jackson has had to battle the vested interests of the big motor companies, it took Dyson ten years to break through commercially, because no distributor or existing manufacturer was prepared to upset the lucrative market for dust bags.\u0027Everyone knows that if we are really going to hit the Government\u0027s target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the hardest nut to crack is transport,\u0027 Jackson says. \u0027We\u0027re just not going to do that with lithium-ion.

This culture of easy come, easy go is likely to end in tears and it\u0027s going to hurt ordinary people who are normally quite responsible but are being enticed into getting into debt.\u0027 The NatWest figures, which are based on internal research to help with setting up its new digital bank Bo, are echoed elsewhere.A study by debt charity Stepchange last week found that the number of middle-class families at risk of falling into debt is spiralling. It helped 9,510 people with net incomes above £40,000 last year, a rise of almost a fifth compared with three years ago.         The research into 750,000 NatWest customers reveals that the problem is not just confined to low-earning households who genuinely struggle to get by, but is also common among the better-off (file photo)Their average credit card debt was £21,091, while their average total outstanding debt, excluding mortgages, came to £38,164.And the Money Charity said the average credit card debt per UK household was £2,609 in July this year. Last year research from the charity found that almost ten million households have no savings at all and 19.3million (71 per cent) have less than £10,000 in savings.Sue Anderson, of Stepchange, said: \u0027The most common reason for problem debt is that people have experienced some kind of income shock – a sudden reduction in earnings, or reduced hours for example.\u0027At times like these, many people would expect savings to be a lifeline, but current economic pressures can make it difficult to save. Instead, iniduals have to live hand to mouth.\u0027She added that having even £1,000 of savings can almost halve the risk of experiencing problem debt. \u0027Our research shows that, if every household had £1,000 of accessible savings, 500,000 fewer households would face problem debt,\u0027 she said.\u0027The Government needs to do more to encourage iniduals to build up their financial resilience.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Operation Yellowhammer starts Michael Gove steps No Deal preparations","story":"Share this article \u0027It ensures that we are prepared to mitigate impacts of even the potential reasonable worst-case scenario if on October 31 the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\u0027Asked yesterday if he could guarantee that the UK would leave the EU by Halloween, Mr Gove said: \u0027Yes, that\u0027s our determined policy.

One large crowd blocked a road close to the Spanish government headquarters in Catalonia, throwing dozens of sacks of rubbish in front of stationary police vans.

It’s a signpost of these ideas always through the lens of art and artists.”The first thing viewers see upon entering the exhibition is Woven Chronicle, an artwork by Indian artist Reena Saini Kallat, created between the years 2011 and 2016. It’s a wall map made of yarn, tracking the global routes where migrants have traveled from contract workers to refugees and asylum seekers. Though the artwork was completed in 2016, the artist keeps updating it to trace new routes.“Over the years, I’ve tried to incorporate changes by updating the research,” said Kallat, who has updated the map with the territorial split between Sudan and South Sudan. “Even though the work is not meant to be an illustration of the numbers of refugees, as we have more data coming in, I keep trying to update the information we have in the archives,” she adds.The Kurdish artist Hayv Kahraman is showing Bab el Sheikh from 2013, an oil on wood wall piece showing a person either descending or ascending a staircase. As a refugee who left Iraq as a child, then moved through Europe and then the US, it’s what co-curator Ruth Erickson calls “a memory of home, reflecting on her own experience as a refugee”.The Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum is showing Exodus II from 2002, a sculpture that connects a pair of suitcases with strands of hair, suggesting separation from familial roots.Also on view are landscape photographs by the California-based artist Richard Misrach, who documented the 2,000-mile border between the US and Mexico for his series Border Cantos from 2004 to 2016.The Irish artist Richard Mosse is showing a three-channel video called Incoming, which was created between 2014 and 2017. “It tracks the route of refugees from North Africa and Middle East to Europe, mostly over water, landing on shores of southern Europe and making their way through refugee camps,” said Respini.One of the most recurrent images in the exhibition is the sea. “The site of the sea, the migration route and the refugee camp all play a role here,” said Erickson.The Moroccan artist Yto Barrada is showing works from her series, A Life Full of Holes: The Strait Project, which the artist created between 1998 and 2003. Today, this part of the Mediterranean sea, the Strait of Gibraltar is the route to the south of Spain’s Andalusia region, which sees more migrant arrivals than anywhere else in Europe, making it especially timely.The Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra is showing works from her Almerisa series, which sees her photographing a Bosnian refugee woman over the course of 14 years, first as a child, and now as a mother.There’s also a new site-specific, community project by the Boston-based artist Anthony Romero, who collaborated with the immigrant community in east Boston. “He did a series of listening sessions, which are immigration stories,” said Erickson. “These audio recordings are a kind of community archiving for east Boston residents, story sharing.”It’s no coincidence that the museum overlooks the Boston harbor, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s a big theme that comes out of our desire to think about our museum site-specifically,” said Respini.“We’re perched on the Boston harbor, and everyone who visits us can see a dramatic view on top of the water. We’re dealing with perilous crossings over sea, a middle passage, we thought it felt right for our building, it’s so prevalent today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/421269fdd65377816fad748cd67264f344742d91/361_0_5429_3259/master/5429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ea985b43d2bffb8ffc85867a962fb16","title":"halloween doggy style the tompkins square parade in pictures","story":"Canine companions in cute and creative costumes took part in the annual Halloween dog parade in Manhattan "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc4038d0e8f413ba7270cf870be7d3327b3bca9/0_0_2657_3543/master/2657.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9bf1ab37c31588cdc8d269424a8ee57f 1760w","title":"silver skaters the rise of skateboarding in california in pictures","story":"Legendary skateboard photographer Hugh Holland has published a book of previously unseen images capturing the growth of the skateboarding craze in California.

This had the effect of keeping the older packs on sale for as as long as possible, maximising brand exposure in the run-up to May 2017, when they could no longer be sold.In the meantime, they came up with innovative ways to make plain-packaged products distinctive. Philip Morris International redesigned its premium Marlboro range, adding bevelled edges and a new “pro-seal” closing mechanism to packets, the researchers found. This made packs “appear more premium and recognisable compared to other brands”, the researchers claimed.The report also pointed to the terms introduced by tobacco companies to describe the filters on their cigarettes, such as “advanced” or “firm”. The researchers said previous studies suggested that such differentiating features “perpetuate the perceptions that some tobacco brand variants are less harmful than others”.“Given that the tobacco industry is attempting to circumvent standardised packaging legislation, other countries considering the policy should consider how to make regulations as comprehensive as possible to prevent the exploitation of continued marketing opportunities,” the report concluded.Tobacco companies have also responded to a ban on taste descriptions, such as “menthol” or “smooth”, by replacing them with names based on colour. Researchers said that banning terms such as “smooth” and “light” was meant to dispel the myth that certain types of cigarette are less dangerous, but that by teaching customers colour codes linked to the old descriptions, “misperceptions are likely to endure”.Another tactic used by the industry was to introduce flavour capsules previously reserved for the most expensive cigarettes into less costly products. The researchers said flavoured cigarettes were more likely to appeal to less regular smokers and young people.The Labour MP Alex Cunningham, who was one of the key proponents of plain packaging laws, said: “No one should be surprised at the tobacco companies doing everything possible to protect their brands, undermine the law and grow their sales. Ministers must act to put an end to this practice.The report’s lead author, Dr Karen Evans-Reeves, said the tobacco industry was “engaged in activities that undermined and continue to undermine the legislation”.“Major tobacco companies will always try to find a way to market their products,” she said. “Based on the number of innovations we found in this study, we would encourage all governments considering implementing plain packaging legislation to consider how tobacco companies have adapted to the legislation in other countries and where possible, close any remaining loopholes.”Philip Morris International, which owns Marlboro, did not respond to requests for comment.  previously revealed that the company produced Marlboro-branded metal tins in the run-up to the plain packaging legislation coming into force. The move was criticised as a ploy to prolong the visibility of Marlboro’s brand in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ef8f783047b8beac14fdf6405a85038c2819d27/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e6d1f1af55b35ac50b4c4dc8bc0aeef","title":"general motors uaw workers strike deal","story":"Feelings ranged from ‘cautiously optimistic’ to ‘skeptical’ among striking members of the UAW in Michigan as they prepare to voteThe autoworkers picketing outside General Motors’ Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant stand to gain more than most if a tentative deal with the company is ultimately approved this week. For a start their jobs would be spared. GM previously slated the plant for closure by January. Instead, its 700 employees could start building electric pickup trucks next year.But as the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike appears to be ending, after more than a month, emotions outside the plant were decidedly mixed last week. Those who spoke with the  said their feelings fell somewhere between “cautiously optimistic” and “skeptical” as a slow trickle of news came from UAW leadership.The union released an outline of the deal last week but the details are still only known to “the guys at the bargaining table”, said Paul Radatz, a 34-year company veteran. Over the weekend UAW members were getting to grips with those details. Voting started on Saturday and is expected to be completed by Friday.“What we hear so far all sounds good, but that’s what they’ll do – come out and tell us all the highlights,” he said. “But this happens with every contract, and there are always things that we have lost that don’t come out until it’s ratified and in print. So we’re waiting for the other shoe to drop.”An hour north in Flint, D’Andre Jackson, a UAW district committee representative said workers at the Flint assembly plant shared that sentiment. While there’s some optimism, “there’s some anxiety” over what isn’t yet known.“I don’t want to see just the shiny chrome pieces. I want to see the meat and potatoes,” Jackson said.The strike has cost GM $100m a day, according to analysts, and there’s no doubt that the UAW has won some significant concessions, a major victory for the union after its longest strike in 10 years. Workers are also feeling ebullient about the resurgence of unions, which are gaining ground as teachers and others have successfully campaigned for wage rises and more. But striking takes its toll.On a cold and windy Thursday small groups of employees waved signs outside the six entrances around the sprawling, 4m sq ft Detroit-Hamtramck plant just a few miles north of GM’s downtown headquarters. They warmed themselves around fires burning in 55-gallon drums and pumped fists as passing motorists hit their horns in solidarity.The highlights of the deal that UAW workers are processing include $11,000 ratification bonuses, paths to full-time employment for temporary workers, pay increases, no changes to healthcare, and other clear wins for the union. The UAW national General Motors council decided on Thursday to recommend ratification, and the rank and file will now vote on it.At least one obvious sticking point remains. Some outside Detroit-Hamtramck vowed to vote against any deal that didn’t also include new product for the recently shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, plant.Beyond that, some frustration still exists, and Radatz said management’s “greed” is still on his mind. He noted that the $11,000 bonuses pale in comparison to the roughly $11,000 per hour that GM’s CEO, Mary Berra, earns. He and others say they aren’t convinced that GM ever truly planned to close Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly because the company invested big in it in recent years, while rumors of an electric truck started months ago. Radatz called the proposal to close the plant a false “negotiating chip”.“Now they can say, ‘See, we’re bargaining in good faith,’ but they haven’t been. That’s a joke,” Radatz said. “But I can’t blame them. You want to have an ace up your sleeve.”Feelings outside Detroit-Hamtramck were also mixed over building electric trucks. While the plant may live to see another day, some are disappointed the company is only promising “a low volume” vehicle that’s viewed as a “test product to see how the public takes to it”. But Julaynne Trusel, a team leader in the body shop, said it beats the alternative.“The doors are staying open and everyone doesn’t need to start looking for jobs, so at least it’s a step in the right direction,” she said. “Hopefully we get some more business over the life of the contract.”Though there’s still some frustration over the bitter fight that played out in recent years and culminated with the strike, employees don’t expect any resentment to linger should the stoppage conclude. After all, the two sides were just “looking out for themselves”, Trusel said.“This is just business and everyone had to handle their business,” she said. “When we come back together, we are going to be like one. We all want to produce the best cars that we can for our customers, so we’re not going back in with a bad attitude.”George Raptis, a materials department employee who has been at Detroit-Hamtramck since 1993, echoed that: “We all want to get back to work, and when we do things will go on like it’s another day.”The stoppage, which is the longest GM has faced since 1970, is inflicting pain on both sides. About 48,000 UAW workers, including 17,000 in Michigan, walked off the job. GM has lost more than $1.5bn because of the strike, while union workers lost more than $835m in wages, according to the East Lansing industry analyst Anderson Economic Group. Union workers are earning just $250 a week, and GM temporarily pulled their health insurance last month.“$250 per week is less than my spousal payment, so I’m in the hole,” said a Detroit-Hamtramck body shop employee and 35-year company veteran who declined to give his name. In Flint, Jackson delayed renovations on a new house he and his wife purchased not long before the strike.“You definitely tighten up the belt and fry up a couple bologna sandwiches instead of grilling up some steaks,” he said.Trusel added that support from other unions and the public helped get workers through financial difficulties. Those picketing outside the plant received free meals and donations of food, diapers, toiletries and other essentials.“There’s been so much support for us. It brings you to tears to know that people care so much,” Trusel said. “It’s been encouraging to know that so many people are saying ‘Stand your ground’.”Should the union come away with a win and public support for workers remain high, the strike could be a shot in the arm for the UAW and the largely beleaguered US labor movement. Radatz applauded leadership for “locking horns with GM” and said its handling of the strike so far has restored the rank and file’s faith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

The sun is setting behind the world-famous silhouette of Table Mountain. A plane on its way to Cape Town’s international airport flies low overhead. Children play on a rusting climbing frame, jumping on an abandoned mattress.Reitz has only just returned to his home in the poor and violent neighbourhood of Bonteheuwel after five years in jail for a firearms offence. He is a member of the Americans, one of the area’s biggest and most violent criminal gangs. On his wrist is the tattoo that marks him out as also being a member of one of South Africa’s major prison gangs. Yards away, police search a line of teenagers turned to a wall.“This is our territory,” says Reitz, 34. “Life is tough here but we have no problem with the police. They keep it stable. That is better for everyone.”The police deployment in Bonteheuwel is part of a new effort by local authorities to stem soaring rates of violent crime on the Cape Flats, a vast sprawl inland of Cape Town that feels a world away from the beaches, restaurants and tourist sites on the other side of the mountain.Few doubt the scale of the problem.“It’s been a bad year – but a really bad five years,” says Simone Haysom, author of a book on gang violence in Cape Town. “Until now, the government seems to have been willing to let the Cape Flats burn.”After almost 1,000 murders in the first six months of this year alone on the Cape Flats, national authorities sent in the army, and armoured convoys have patrolled the rutted streets of the area’s worst neighbourhoods of the Cape Flats since July. The deployment was extended by South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in September.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially. This week  Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope.\u0026nbspAfrica correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town\u0027s spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author\u0026nbspNiq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the other Soweto, one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see.\u0026nbspWe hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children.\u0026nbspWe explore the deadly underground world of\u0026nbspzama zama\u0026nbspgold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay\u0026nbspby Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.The police patrolling in Bonteheuwel are from one of two freshly constituted units of Cape Town’s  force that are dispatched to some of the worst areas.“The community is tired of the gangs, and criminals think twice if they see us in the area,” says the inspector who leads the team.Through the evening and night, he and his dozen officers, all recruited locally, will stop and search a score of teenagers, raid a shattered, destitute house used solely by local drug addicts and search for firearms in squalid huts. Walls in the neighbourhood are marked with graffiti showing which gang is in control of each block.Bonteheuwel was constructed in the 1960s by the repressive, racist apartheid regime that ruled South Africa until 1994. Apartheid planners purged Cape Town of black and mixed-race communities, dumping them in townships built without amenities or transport links on the sandy Cape Flats. Gangs developed rapidly from the mid-1990s onwards, recruiting among unemployed youth.As violent crime has risen across South Africa since 2011, so too has gang violence on the Cape Flats.“There are more criminal networks in South Africa now, more foreign networks and more criminal businesses,” says Haysom.Cape Town is run by South Africa’s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, further complicating the fight against gang violence. DA officials accuse the African National Congress, in power at national level for 25 years, of starving the province of police resources.Albert Fritz, provincial minister for community safety, says violence on the Cape Flats has been very localised.So far, the new deployment to Bonteheuwel has been a success. There were 44 killings in the first half of the year but there has been only one between June and mid-September a hit on a gang leader. But a similar effort in Delft, a much bigger neighbourhood that lacks the strong community involvement that has taken place in Bonteheuwel, has had less impact, and there is little sign that the army deployment has improved the situation. By some measures, murders have increased.“We must not give up … I am optimistic,” says Fritz. “The gangs … will always be there, but we can reduce their impact and power.”One of the most notorious neighbourhoods is Manenberg, a crowded series of low-rise apartment blocks and battered two-room homes where a series of gangs – the Americans, Hard Livings, Fancy Boys, Dixie Boys and others – fight to control a lucrative trade in cannabis, crystal meth and sedatives.Officers from Cape Town’s specialist anti-gang unit describe an anarchic free-for-all, with young criminals in their teens providing “cannon fodder” for wealthy criminals who live in big houses in sought-after suburbs well away from Manenberg’s rubbish-strewn streets.“The gangs build support among local residents by providing protection, handouts sometimes and keeping order,” says one officer. “That’s a problem for us. Everyone should be equal before the law, whoever they are.”Investigations into major gang leaders are often stymied by corruption and fear.Roegshanda Pascoe, an activist from Manenberg who witnessed a gang murder and agreed to testify against six men arrested for the killing, has faced attacks on her home and family. She has lived in a series of secret locations since the trial began, but has refused an official witness protection scheme that would have forced her to leave the region.“I feel very hopeless,” says Pascoe, 44. “I will never be able to go home … But it’s not just about people in Manenberg, or in Cape Town … it’s about the whole nation.”On the eastern fringe of the Flats, where the spectacular wineries and resorts that draw wealthy tourists from all over the world are clearly visible, is Mfuleni, an expanse of makeshift housing that is poor even by local standards.Ayanda Tunce, known as 2SLY, grew up in Mfuleni. He spent 10 years as a gangster and five years in prison.Tunce, 34, once wanted to be a doctor. As a teenager he was running errands for gang leaders and got a criminal record. At 22, he robbed a local drug dealer of two handguns and set up his own gang, selling drugs and maiming rivals. Now a father of three, he lives in a two-room shack with no sanitation and says he has rejected crime.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4834343e069cc76f94585cddc6eec09b49e1377a/0_353_3215_1929/master/3215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2f5a3877d8b25f9fdf1104974cfd1b9","title":"europe fed up brexit best stay in macron extension","story":"Macron may have doubts, but if the deal isn’t approved the EU must grant the UK an extension – for its own sake as well as oursGranted, Brexit is driving everyone mad. We Brits owe all our European friends a sincere apology, a bottle of whisky and complimentary tickets to a Royal Shakespeare Company performance of Hamlet. For Britain is now Hamlet, forever agonising over whether Brexit is to be or not to be.So I can perfectly understand why Europeans such as French president Emmanuel Macron just want to be shot of us, so as to push ahead with an important, ambitious agenda for the whole European Union. Nonetheless, it remains in Europe’s own enlightened, long-term interest to go the extra kilometre. This means, concretely, that if the British parliament does not approve Boris Johnson’s new deal this week, the EU should offer an article 50 extension, as formally requested in the letter sent (though childishly not signed) by Johnson.I offer four arguments for this, all made from the point of view of the EU and Europe as a whole. First, a no-deal Brexit would be hugely damaging to Ireland and other parts of Europe geographically close to the UK. The amendment proposed by the independent Conservative Oliver Letwin and passed by parliament on Saturday is intended, above all, to preclude no deal. Letwin himself has said he will vote for Johnson’s deal, if it comes through parliament in the correct legal form and subject to proper scrutiny.Second, there is the question of who takes the blame. We know from a leaked document that the Johnson team of hard Brexiteers were preparing to blame any failure to get a deal on the “crazy” intransigence of Brussels. If, however, Macron were to make an unholy alliance with Johnson to push Britain out of the door on 31 October, then my side of the Brexit argument – the 3R side: for referendum, remain and reform – would be bound to place part of the blame on our European partners. At the moment, the EU has got itself in exactly the right position: it has showed sufficient firmness to defend the interests of Ireland and the single market, and sufficient flexibility to make any accusation of a punitive “Versailles” treaty completely implausible. For example, the EU breached its own red lines in reopening the withdrawal agreement, to make possible the new deal. It’s important that the EU stays in this sweet spot.Third, it would be better for the long-term future of Europe if the UK stayed in the EU. There is no good outcome to Brexit, but the least worst way forward is for Britain to vote in a second referendum to remain. And the best way to achieve that is for parliament to vote for Johnson’s deal but subject to a confirmatory referendum in which the British public would be asked to make a binding, final decision on a single, clear question: do you want Britain to leave the EU on the terms negotiated by this government, or do you want it to stay in the EU? To be or not to be.Since this government is dominated by hard Brexiteers – and what is envisaged in the new deal is a hard Brexit for England, Wales and Scotland, with a softer one only for Northern Ireland – no leave voter could plausibly complain they were only being offered the choice between a flaccid Brino (Brexit in Name Only) and staying in the EU. Hundreds of thousands rallied outside parliament on Saturday to show their support for such a people’s vote. Even more important than the activists are the opinion polls that now persistently show a majority for remain. How absurd it would be if the UK was to leave the EU, in the name of respecting “the will of the people”, at precisely the moment when the will of the people had changed.I know that many continental European friends who were once sympathetic to a second referendum now think the EU would be better off without us. But if Britain leaves now, it will take another five years to work out what the new economic relationship with the EU will be and whether Scotland will leave the United Kingdom, and then a further five years to see how all this beds down in practice. By that time, the EU and what is left of the UK will certainly have erged. Britain will be worse off economically than it might have been, but probably not so badly off that stubborn English voters, in particular, would swiftly choose to return. If Brexit goes badly for the UK, that will ensure a thoroughly unhappy and bad-tempered relationship across the Channel, negatively affecting the vital cooperation on foreign and security policy.If, against the odds, Brexit goes well for Britannia, then nationalist populists like Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, the Italian Matteo Salvini and France’s Marine Le Pen will start to say, in those immortal words from the movie When Harry Met Sally: “I’ll have what she’s having.” Either way, it’s bad for the European Union.And there’s a fourth argument that should clinch the case. At the moment, Europe is the last best hope of a values-based west, standing up for democracy and the rule of law. Confronted with the demolition of liberal democracy in EU member states such as Hungary, this is one of the most important tasks for the next chapter of EU history, with new leadership in all European institutions, a freshly elected European parliament and a seven-year budget to be agreed.Prominent among the European leaders crowding round to congratulate Johnson after the deal was done last week was Orbán – he and Johnson are brothers under the skin. Johnson’s schoolboy manoeuvre of sending an unsigned, photocopied letter requesting an extension (as mandated by the so-called Benn act), together with a signed one encouraging the EU to refuse that request, shows just how contemptuous he is of a law passed by Britain’s sovereign parliament. Although his lawyers probably ensured that his conduct did not violate the letter of the law, it certainly violated the spirit of the law.Fortunately, the checks and balances of British liberal democracy are working. In a magnificent, muscular verdict, the supreme court found that Johnson acted unlawfully in trying to prorogue parliament for five weeks. And on Saturday, a democratically elected parliament once again took back control from a bullying executive, to ensure proper scrutiny of a hastily made deal which has epochal implications for both Britain and Europe. Whether this ends with a confirmatory referendum, as I hope, or with a general election, which seems more likely – or with parliament narrowly approving Johnson’s deal, which I would lament but accept – it will be a lawful, democratic process. And a lawful, democratic process is something Europe should always support, even if it takes a little longer.• Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and  columnist.

And two women, one on each side of the Atlantic, are leading the wayJust for a moment, let us pull our eyes away from Brexit and focus instead on two interwoven stories about how the world has gone wrong, and what it might take to start to put it right. At the centre of each is a woman who has set herself against the male-dominated corporations we collectively know as big tech. What is happening is about high politics and the grind of government rather than street-level noise and mass activism, which is maybe why it still seems overlooked.The frontrunner in the US Democratic party’s crowded nomination contest seems to be the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Over the past couple of years she has hardened her intentions to tackle the power of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Thanks to leaked recordings of Mark Zuckerberg addressing a meeting of his staff, we know he seems to consider her plans an “existential” threat that would “suck for us”, and that he would “go to the mat” to fight them.Wherever the “mat” is, Warren seems to be there already. Ten days ago, she highlighted Facebook’s mixture of massive power and abject irresponsibility by confronting Zuckerberg with its decision, taken last year, to exempt political ads from its rules on false and misleading content – something recently manifested in Trump campaign ads that tell demonstrable lies about Warren’s Democratic rival Joe Biden. In response, Warren’s organisation put material on Facebook that told users that Zuckerberg was a Donald Trump supporter – before pointing out the falsehood, and reminding users that the company has given the president “free rein to lie”.Her basic point was punchy and effective: “Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They’ve decided to let political figures lie to you – even about Facebook itself – while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.”In response, with his usual cosmic levels of chutzpah, Zuckerberg used a speech last week to frame his blithe attitude to political lying in terms of free speech, citing Martin Luther King, claiming Facebook was founded in the wake of the Iraq war to ensure people had “a voice” (short correction: its origins actually go back to a “hot or not” website for Harvard students) and that his company represents a new “fifth estate” central to the workings of democracy. The whole thing would have been funny, if it hadn’t shown us Zuckerberg does not have the sensitivity or humility to match his company’s power.True to the way that a news cycle tied to social media tends to work, the clash over political ads is already obscuring the key issues Warren is talking about. She has two big objections to the way Facebook and other tech giants exercise their power. One is how they have endlessly been allowed to acquire potentially threatening competitors – so if she got her way, Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp would be reversed. She would also classify big companies that offer their users an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties as “platform utilities”, and if their annual global revenue exceeds $25bn (£19bn), insist they cannot carry on selling their own products via the spaces they host.As a result, Apple would no longer be able to offer Apple Music and Apple News on its online store, and Amazon couldn’t hawk its own goods alongside those of third-party sellers. This is big stuff: whatever its chances of getting through a future Congress, it at least represents the kind of clear, coherent programme for starting to deal with big tech that has so far tended to get lost in a haze of ifs and buts.A parallel story is unfolding in Europe. For five years, the Danish former politician Margrethe Vestager has been the European commissioner for competition. Her record is studded with big moves on the same corporations targeted by Warren – among them, a demand for €13bn (£11bn) in unpaid Irish taxes from Apple, and a €1.5bn fine levied this year against Google for abusive advertising practices. Her take on social media is crisp: “I would like to have a Facebook in which I pay a fee each month, but I would have no tracking and advertising and the full benefits of privacy.”Trump thinks Vestager “hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I have ever met”, an opinion which seems only to have propelled her further: she is about to start work as European commission vice-president in charge of “Europe fit for the digital age”, and combine her anti-monopoly activities with a dedicated focus on tech.While Britain may be sailing off into whatever zero-regulation dystopia the Conservatives have in mind, Vestager wants EU countries to at last get to grips with what tech is doing to the most basic aspects of society. She apparently wants to prioritise people’s control of their data, and insists that Europe’s use of artificial intelligence must be within the kind of ethical guidelines absent in the US and China.What this will mean in practice is so far unclear. But it dovetails with EU plans for restrictions on facial recognition technology – and potentially, the kind of malignant AI lately chronicled in the ’s series on what automation is doing to the welfare state and how it treats poor and vulnerable people.Something is belatedly happening, on both the right and left, as well as in the heart of national governments: from France’s new tax on the local profits of tech corporations to the US Federal Trade Commission’s robust noises about their reach, the most unbridled kind of corporate power is at last being meaningfully contested.Meanwhile, every week seems to bring signs that the companies’ old veneer of invincibility is cracking, something vividly highlighted by the mounting crises befalling Facebook’s hubristic plans for a new online currency, which Zuckerberg will try to explain to a congressional committee this week. Big tech’s lobbyists are clearly readying themselves for a series of showdowns about the extent of its power.The key problem comes down to the difficulty of pursuing big tech in a world that it not only controls, but defines. We read about Warren and Vestager on the same feeds that dissolve even the best intentions into the usual meaningless noise. But, on a good day, what seems to be happening brings to mind the call to action that concludes Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. “It is up to us to use our knowledge, to regain our bearings, to stir others to do the same, and to found a new beginning,” she says. Maybe – just maybe – we are starting to see what that might look like in practice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86cde60972ec27bbc9f8d7848a81ed1a00827a47/0_229_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88f323a96422b90626cb606762ef50e","title":"syria arab spring egypt sudan syria","story":"Dissent in the face of rampant corruption is no longer being dampened by pointing to the failures of the Arab springThere is a bogeyman that haunts the Arab world. Its spectre looms large and sinister over Arab politics. Its arrival is threatened, like a curse, as a warning by parents to precocious children when they misbehave. Its name is Syria. A suppurating wound that will not heal, the Syrian civil war continues to bleed lives, and draw in neighbours and allies involved in their own proxy battles.Just as it seems one front is closed, a twist restarts hostilities – the latest involving a capricious US president and an insecure Turkish one, with the Kurds in northern Syria bearing the brunt. An abrupt American withdrawal paved the way for yet another conflagration, yet another power calculus – as Bashar al-Assad extends support to the Kurds – and yet another lease of life for Islamic State. More than 100,000 people are on the move in northern Syria. And at least 750 people with suspected links to Isis have reportedly broken out of a camp in north-east Syria, raising the possibility of a new shot in the arm for the terror group. When, earlier this year, the Sudanese revolution began to gather steam, the Syria bogeyman was predictably summoned. It didn’t help that Sudan had received Syrian refugees. Their increasing number in Sudan – a country more accustomed to sending refugees than receiving them – was its own live warning. Is this what you want?

Libya, riven by factional fighting and only last month the scene of US airstrikes against militants, is also often mentioned with a shudder, a “there but for the grace of God go we” if we continue challenging the status quo. Then there is Egypt, a country that, in its regression after the Arab spring, is now such a closely patrolled security state that the number of political prisoners in its jails is literally inestimable.Each day seems to bring a fresh hell across these three countries, a rebuke to all those who think that in the Arab world there is another way of politics that doesn’t involve strongmen. You hear this logic internalised and vocalised by Arabs themselves in a sort of exceptionalist self-flattery. It’s just our temperament, you see, we need leaders to manage our strong and stubborn character. It doesn’t seem to be working. This is the year that the spirit of protest in the region was proven to only have been dormant, rather than extinct. The Sudanese overthrew Omar al-Bashir in a grand majestic revolution, where a revolutionary body of thousands pitted itself against the formidable machinery of the state’s military dictatorship. Despite the country already suffering from ethnic and tribal ides so pronounced that an entire murderous paramilitary complex arose from its fissures, despite there being a history of bloody conflict that pointed more towards a Syria- or Libya-style disintegration, this was not enough to chill the need for change. Even after hundreds were slaughtered and the internet shut down, protesters still coordinated and found their way on to the streets of Sudanese cities.Not even in Egypt has the protest movement died. If there is any indication that scorched earth suppression is inevitably a short-term solution, it is that protests are happening again. In September the first significant protests since former army chief Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power. In this country a tweet or a Facebook post can result in a jail sentence and the security stakes are so high that a protester will leave home expecting not to return. Many did not. Estimates are that about 2,000 were detained.Last week it was Lebanon, where protests have erupted across several cities. There is now a similar kaleidoscope of images that plays out across Arab cities where lines have been drawn between the people and the government. Sometimes one has to squint to work out whether the throng of bodies and mobile phone screen constellations is in Beirut, Cairo or Khartoum. Both in Lebanon and in Sudan, one scene repeated itself with uncanny similarity protesters addressing the security forces, the army and the police, rebuking them for not crossing the lines to join their comrades. In Sudan many did cross those lines, joining the revolutionaries against their own employers.That defection, or demand for defection, lies at the heart of the resurgence of political protest. If the Arab revolutions that grew eight years ago were about removing lone dictators, the current wave is about removing an establishment that for too long has drained resources. Egypt’s protests were triggered by a former government contractor who exposed Sisi’s epic profligacy. In Sudan, food prices and a scarcity of basics pushed the middle class over the edge while those in power luxuriated in their spoils. In Lebanon, a tax on WhatsApp voice calls tipped those fed up with economic mismanagement over the edge. Last month it emerged that the prime minister, Saad Hariri, had gifted $16m of his own money to a South African model six years ago.Dissent will not be chilled by pointing to the failures of the Arab spring. Warnings to remain quiet, pointing to the pitfalls of taking action, are increasingly going unheeded. Arabs are beginning to realise that to excessively fear what may happen in the future is to be tricked into submitting to an unacceptable present."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90865a23f80ffbb299caab1f179ee8860dea6efa/79_231_5063_3038/master/5063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c904ff5d77f58719d1f222a8b7dd9ed7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of trick","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘trick’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘trick’.Share your photos of what trick means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 23 October at 10am.

It’s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there’s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.Line up a lobsterWhether it’s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.Take in colourful LunenburgThe charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It’s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It’s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg’s history of rum running.Have a pre-breakfast surfThe secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it’s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.Sea kayaking in Cape LaHaveKayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.The Rum Runners TrailDuring Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.Alight at Peggy’s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy’s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.Fossil hunt at Bay of FundyThe Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it’s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.On the Halifax waterfrontHalifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers’ markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner’s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.Explore the coastlineWherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone’s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.Enjoy the east-coast hospitality and explore Halifax with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50fb6da1ae73636e2aa40a92f9fbeadeace186b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a53cf6abdfb399d6807b28a274840bb9","title":"we have the best hole in the walls the insider guide to edmonton","story":"Hometown devotee Jen Mallia chats with city ambassador Linda Hoang and photographer extraordinaire Emilie Iggiotti for the inside scoop on Edmonton, Alberta’s buzzing capitalEdmonton boasts an arts scene that won’t quit and a banging array of places to eat and drink, plus opportunities to commune with nature, shop indie boutiques or visit the largest mall on the continent. It’s a welcoming city on the prairies of roughly a million people – a home for artists, tradespeople, academics, government workers, and people from around the world. Edmonton is the place you didn’t know you belonged!Another way to enjoy the mix of the urban and provincial in Edmonton is at one of the farmers’ markets. Many of them are outdoor, and therefore seasonal, but a select few operate year-round indoors. The Downtown Farmers’ Market is an indoor-outdoor hybrid. During the winter months, the market takes over one of downtown’s historic buildings, and in the warmer months it takes to the streets.During the summer months, the outdoor markets shift around the city, and you’ll find local gems around Edmonton’s inner neighbourhoods on both Saturdays and Sundays from June through to Canadian Thanksgiving in mid-October, when vendors up stalls and shift indoors. (Insider tip: don’t miss Moonshine Doughnuts at Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market – vegan and delicious!)Edmonton is nicknamed Festival City for a reason – you won’t get too far without happening upon a celebration. If a person likes something, Edmonton has a festival for it … from ice to cats! One of the most popular is the Edmonton international fringe theatre festival, held in venues centred in the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Every year at the end of August, performers from around the world contribute their work. Attendees can see a show at almost any time of the day or night, then hang out in the beer garden, trading critiques on the performances that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Trendy Whyte Avenue is the backbone of the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Take time to poke through the shops, restaurants, and bars that line the avenue and surrounding blocks. Don’t miss brunch at Pip, or satisfy your sweet tooth at La Boule or Sugared \u0026amp Spiced. A soft serve ice-cream from Yelo’d is the perfect accompaniment to a sunny day. Venture a bit to the southeast to check out the new Ritchie Market – notably for Transcend Coffee or something stronger from Blind Enthusiasm brewery. Their craft beers pair well with the bites from adjacent Biera.Just like Fringe, Rust Magic is an annual festival that features the work of local and international artists. But Instead of treading the boards, these artists are spray-painting them. Each year since 2016, 15 new murals have been created and bequeathed to the city. Plans are in the works for guided tours of the street art during the festival, and maps are readily available at local businesses for self-guided exploration. Periodically throughout the year, Hoang herself runs Photo Walks featuring Instagrammable Walls of Edmonton, which are a great way to see some city colour and get some superb pics to take home too.Before Alberta developed its oil and gas industry, it was straight-up farming and ranch country. Calling back to the area’s agricultural heritage, high-calibre restaurants are cropping up all over town, with chefs focusing on innovative ways to use locally grown and sourced ingredients. A great way to sample a variety of these restaurants is with a culinary tour from Eat or Alberta Food Tours you can also pedal between nibbles and drinks with Food Bike Tours or the big bikes from Urban Pedal.You won’t go hungry in any area of the city, but a high concentration of foodie favourites are found downtown and in the Ice District. Try the vegan pizzas at Die Pie, Italian to die for at Uccellino, wood-fired creations at Woodwork, or share some plates at Bundok or Baijiu.West of downtown has experienced a hip revival in recent years. In addition to arty new shops, there are tons of places to eat. Start at Wilfred’s in the Brewery District, then swing by the Oliver Exchange Building, full of great places to grab a bite or a drink. Come hungry to enjoy Canadian cuisine at RGE RD on 123rd Street NW. A short walk to the north-east brings you to the fresh and French Café Linnea. If you still have room after that, locals swear by the treats at Duchess Bake Shop and the vegan cookies at Bloom Cookie Co.Before heading off, make sure to toast your time in the city. There are ample opportunities to enjoy a pint or two. To curate the experience, try a brewery tour from Alberta Craft Tours or Urban Pedal. If you are going it on your own, make sure Sea Change, Strathcona Spirits, Town Square, and the newly opened Polar Park are on your list. Make time for an inventive cocktail at the cosy Bar Clementine or chic Partake. For something a little different, try to score tickets on Eventbrite for one of the seasonal Street Car Cask events hosted by the Common. There’s beer and snacks and lots of fun, as the reconditioned streetcar travels across the top of the High Level Bridge connecting downtown and Old Strathcona.Fly London to Edmonton with WestJet to enjoy this growing city.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848f735006cb5b3759a005ce70803a3104c5c6b4/0_259_3599_2160/master/3599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0e807adc9a57d774d8775264789a2f","title":"how uks disused mine shafts plan to store renewable energy","story":"Gravitricity develops winch and hoist system to store energy at half the cost of lithium-ion batteriesBritain’s cheapest “virtual battery” could be created by hoisting and dropping 12,000-tonne weights – half the weight of the Statue of Liberty – down disused mine shafts, according to Imperial College London.The surprising new source of “gravity energy” is being developed by Gravitricity, an Edinburgh-based startup, which hopes to use Britain’s old mines to make better use of clean electricity at half the cost of lithium-ion batteries.Gravitricity said its system effectively stores energy by using electric winches to hoist the weights to the top of the shaft when there is plenty of renewable energy available, then dropping the weights hundreds of metres down vertical shafts to generate electricity when needed.The scheme mimics hydropower projects which have played a key role in helping to balance the electricity grid since the Dinorwig project in Wales began operating in the mid-1970s.Charlie Blair, Gravitricity’s managing director, said: “The beauty of this is that this can be done multiple times a day for many years, without any loss of performance. This makes it very competitive against other forms of energy storage – including lithium-ion batteries.”A full-scale project would drop 24 weights totalling 12,000 tonnes to a depth of 800 metres to produce enough electricity to power 63,000 homes for more than an hour.By carefully controlling the winches Gravitricity said it could extend this period by allowing the weights to fall at a slower rate and release electricity over a longer period.The company is currently in discussion with mine owners in the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic and South Africa, where mine shafts could be more than 2,000 metres deep.Oliver Schmidt, the lead author of Imperial’s report, said Gravitricity’s model is the most price competitive energy storage option because it has a relatively low upfront cost and a potential life of more than 25 years.The report found that electricity released by a typical 10MW lithium-ion battery project, capable of releasing 24MW of electricity per hour, would cost $367 (£283) per megawatt-hour over its lifetime compared with a cost of $171 (£132)MWh for electricity from a Gravitricity project.Schmidt said: “I don’t expect Gravitricity to displace all lithium batteries on grids, but it certainly looks like a compelling proposition.”The system was first developed by Gravitricity’s founder, Peter Fraenkel, who also invented the world’s first full-scale tidal energy turbines. The design was bought by the German industrial firm Siemens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cbb36fedac9cfc7ba6326dcceb7f54d4a6a7476/9_236_4918_2951/master/4918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa0fb87daec8a94f543ad4516d876a1","title":"renewable energy to expand by 50 in next five years report","story":"Energy agency says solar power will drive faster than forecast growth in renewablesThe International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years.Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US.“This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.” reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies.However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets.The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects.The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries.The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills.But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria.“Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said.He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

But we may be getting close to saturation point Stephen King rules modern horror – but how much of his reign can we take? In 2019, his stories seem to be everywhere. On Halloween comes Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining. It is the fourth King-derived movie this year, following Pet Sematary, In the Tall Grass (Netflix’s third King adaptation in three years) and, still on release, It: Chapter Two. Meanwhile, coming to the small screen we have HBO’s The Outsider, Amazon’s The Dark Tower, a Julianne Moore-led Lisey’s Story, The Stand, season three of Mr Mercedes and season two of Castle Rock. His 61st novel, The Institute, was also released last month. A TV adaptation is already in the works.You do not have to look far for explanations for King’s ubiquity. For one thing, It: Chapters One and Two are two of the highest-grossing horror movies ever. For another, King movies have an illustrious pedigree: Carrie, The Shining, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, The Dead Zone, etc. In a content-hungry but risk-averse age, he is a recognisable seal of quality. And where so many current titles are built on elaborate mythologies, political allegory or genre-savvy trickery, King is a master at inserting supernatural elements into familiar settings: a hotel, a car, high school, suburbia. He makes horror for people who wouldn’t say they liked horror. King has also used his brand identity for good, though, via his “dollar babies”. In 1977, he decided to let aspiring film-makers option any of his short stories for one dollar, on the condition they didn’t exhibit them commercially. As a result, many King stories have been filmed several times over there are at least 18 different versions of Mute, for example. One dollar-baby beneficiary was Frank Darabont, whose adaptation of The Woman in the Room paved the way for The Shawshank Redemption.Not everything King touches turns to gold. Darabont’s Shawshank follow-up The Green Mile was textbook “magical negro” shmaltz. And the 2017 film version of The Dark Tower, led by Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, bombed. The Shining can hardly count as a King triumph, given Stanley Kubrick added his own elements (the twins, the blood elevator, the maze, “Here’s Johnny”). Doctor Sleep is based on King’s 2013 sequel, catching up with tricycling Danny Torrance as a grownup (Ewan McGregor), but for continuity’s sake, the movie has to incorporate “the cinematic universe” of Kubrick’s Shining.The difference between the two Shinings is illuminating: Kubrick reshaped it as a psychological horror, more interested in the demons within King’s stories, by contrast, avoid ambiguity. Rather, King’s tales often reassure us that the horror is not within ourselves. For some reason, we can’t get enough of hearing that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e69a387eef4f1d0304200fd8e848cad00db9f5a/0_2859_4457_2673/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5835f4e12cf52ab39fa578757ff3dc1b","title":"nigel slater autumn recipes take time spiced rice beef rib","story":"Spiced rice and pumpkin, comforting beef rib and potato, raspberry mille-feuille: layered recipes, contrasting autumn flavoursI am on the brink of lighting the first fire of the year. In fact, by the time you read this, I shall probably have done so. And with the cooler weather comes a different type of eating. Slower and (slightly) more complex, the sort of cooking that keep us a little longer in the kitchen but also at the table. Food to linger over.Lasagne aside, the most famous of layered recipes is probably biryani, where meat and rice is pressed down in a pot with onions and spices and often enclosed in a pastry crust. To say it’s a lot of work is an understatement. It is one those dishes I tend to leave to restaurant cooks.A somewhat simpler version can be made without meat, and without the pastry crust. I did a version this week, layering saffron rice with mashed pumpkin and spiced onions that took a good hour, but without the inevitable fuss of the classic.Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in a deep pan then add the onions and cook over a low to moderate heat. Grate the ginger and stir into the onions with the chilli flakes, and let them continue cooking until the onions are soft and golden brown – a good 25 minutes.Peel the pumpkin, cut into large pieces, then steam for 15 minutes till soft. Drain and mash with a vegetable masher or fork. Stir in black pepper and a little salt.Wash the rice in warm water: put the rice in a large bowl with plenty of warm water, stir the rice around in the water with your hand, pour off the cloudy water, then repeat twice until the water is almost clear. Drain the rice, put in a medium-sized saucepan with enough water to cover by 3cm. Add the saffron and whole cardamom pods, peppercorns, bay leaves and cinnamon stick, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the water simmers, then cover tightly with a lid. Leave to cook for 10 minutes.Remove the rice from the heat and leave to rest without removing the lid. Coarsely grate the beetroot and set aside. Lift the lid from the rice and stir briefly with a fork to separate the grains.Now assemble the dish. Pour the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the dish then add one third of the rice followed by a third of the pumpkin. Scatter a third of the onions over the pumpkin then half of the beetroot. Now continue layering until all the rice, pumpkin, onion and beetroot is finished.Bake for an hour at 200Cgas mark 6.Crab and avocado is a comfortable marriage, needing only something crisp to press all my bells at once. (I often serve carta di musica with mashed avocado and white crab meat.) I sometimes dice cucumber finely and fold it into the avocado cream too. A layer of crunch amid the smooth green cream and flakes of seafood.You can make a modern version of the seafood cocktail by layering mashed avocado, cucumber and crab meat – I use both the brick-red brown meat and the snowy needles of sweet white flesh. It can look beautiful in a wine glass, especially when the layers are put together loosely rather than tightly packed. A squeeze of lime wouldn’t go amiss and I like to put in some coriander too, a herb very much at home with both crab and avocado.Peel and stone the avocados, then put the flesh into the bowl of a food processor. Squeeze in the lime juice. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli then add to the avocado and process it all to a smooth, pale green paste.Peel the cucumber, core with a teaspoon and discard the seeds, then cut first into thick strips then into small cubes and fold into the avocado cream.Check the white and brown crab meat for any remaining shell, then fork the chopped coriander through the white meat.Loosely layer the avocado and white and brown crab meats in four glasses or small dishes, chill for half an hour and serve.The first time I met the mixture of filo, spinach and feta was aboard a ferry bound for the Greek islands circa 1980 and I have loved it ever since. For all its cellophane wrapper and dubious age, I wolfed my flaky pastry parcel gratefully and have used the combination in tarts, salads and little pies ever since. (Try brushing a sheet of filo with melted butter then sprinkling it with sea salt and dried thyme. Bake till crisp, then shatter the cooked pastry and scatter over a salad of spinach leaves and feta.)This time, a roll-up of chilli-flecked spinach and melted cheese baked inside the filo. The rolled layers of vegetables, cheese and pastry formed a simple lunch with a salad of tomato, black olive and basil.Set the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Wash the spinach, then, with the leaves still wet, place it in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Cover tightly with a lid and let the leaves cook in their own steam for a minute or two till wilted. Tip them into a colander and squeeze out any moisture.Roughly chop the spinach and the dill and mix them together. Coarsely grate the feta and mozzarella into the spinach and dill, then season with black pepper and the chilli flakes. Melt the butter in a small pan.Place a sheet of filo on a work surface or chopping board. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Place a second sheet on top, butter it, then repeat with a third sheet. With the longest edge towards you, shape half of the filling in a long sausage, along the nearest edge.Roll the pastry away from you, covering the filling and forming a long cylinder. Transfer to a baking tin.Now repeat with the remaining three sheets of pastry and the remaining filling. Place the second roll close to the first. Brush with the last of the butter then sprinkle with the nigella, poppy and sesame seeds.Bake for about 20 minutes till the pastry is pale gold, then serve immediately.It was the first properly cold morning of autumn when we set about making this deeply comforting dish. Layers of potato and cheap, bone-in meat for a night when the chestnut leaves are piling up in the lane outside the house. The hands-on cooking time here is minimal, involving little more than the slicing of onions and Maris Pipers, but the unattended cooking time, when the recipe gets on with things itself, is a good two hours. The dish is all the better for that, the flavours deepen and the separate elements – the meat, stock and potatoes – become, deliciously, as one.During the layering of meat and potatoes I like to tuck in the stripped rib bones, and in so doing extracting every last bit of goodness and savour from them. On the side, a crisp white cabbage salad, perhaps (olive oil, white wine vinegar, dill), and some bread with which to sponge up the herb-stippled juices.Cut the beef into ribs. Warm the oil in a large, deep-sided pan, then brown the ribs all over, taking care as they may spit and pop. Turn the ribs over with kitchen tongs as they colour, removing them to a plate when their fat is golden.Peel and thinly slice the onions then put them into the pan in which you have just browned the beef, adding the thyme, rosemary, bay and peppercorns, and lower the heat to moderate. Let the onions cook, giving them the occasional stir, for about 20 minutes, until they are soft and light gold.Return the beef ribs to the pan, together with any juices from the plate, then pour over the beef stock and bring to the boil. Lower the heat so the liquid quietly putters, partially cover with a lid, and leave for 1 hour or until the meat can easily be cut from the bones.Set the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Remove the ribs from the pan and pull the meat from the bones. Slice the potatoes thinly, using a mandoline if you have one, a large cook’s knife if not. In a large, shallow baking dish or roasting tin, layer the potatoes and the meat and onions, seasoning each layer as you go with salt and black pepper, then pour over the stock from the pan.Bake for an hour to 90 minutes, until the potatoes are soft and giving.As much as I like the idea of the classic layered mille-feuille I feel it only works when the pastry is very dark, thin and crisp and the filling involves a few sharp fruits to contrast the soft, billowing blandness of the cream. Raspberries, blackberries and blackcurrants then, rather than peaches and strawberries. You can go further with the contrasting textures by adding crushed brittle or almond or pistachio praline to the whipped cream. The cream is best when beaten until only just thick enough to spread.You will need a small, lightly oiled baking sheet and two large baking sheets, one of which is lined with baking parchment.Set the oven at 220Cgas mark 8. Put the sugar in a non-stick shallow pan over a low to moderate heat. Watch very carefully as it melts, then, when it is golden, add the shelled pistachios. As the sugar darkens to a deep bronze, tip the mixture out onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and leave to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 28cm x 33cm. Transfer to the baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Place a second sheet of parchment on top, then cover with the second large baking sheet. Place a heavy roasting tin on top then bake for 15-20 minutes.Remove the roasting tin, baking sheet and top layer of parchment, then continue to bake for a further five minutes or until the pastry is deep golden brown and very crisp.Break the pistachio brittle into large pieces and reduce to coarse crystals using a food processor. If you prefer, pound the brittle to crumbs with a pestle and mortar.Whip the cream until thick. Crush the raspberries with a fork and fold them into the cream together with three quarters of the crushed nut brittle. Cut the pastry in half lengthways and trim the edges, crushing the trimmings to crumbs with a knife.Place one of the two sheets of pastry on a serving dish or board. Spoon the cream, fruit and nut filling on top, smooth the surface flat pushing the cream right to the edge of the pastry, then cover with the second piece of pastry. Press down lightly on the cake with your hands or a baking sheet to settle the layers of cream and pastry.Smooth the edges flat with a palette knife, then cover the sides with the reserved pastry crumbs, pushing them in with the knife.To decorate, mix the reserved brittle with the icing sugar, then scatter over the top of the cake. Place the remaining raspberries along the top and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76b4ca24a8ad97f332e3e09a6b015d7e74409079/0_139_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b51c2cedeb37527ccc0ca864b487e","title":"womens football have you tried to set up a grassroots team","story":"We want to hear from those who have struggled to set up women’s football teams Women’s football has seen a score of successes in recent months: England’s top league went professional, the World Cup was watched by record-breaking audiences and crowds during the current FA cup are growing.The number of girls and women taking up the sport has also skyrocketed, with 605 new girls youth teams and 260 new adult female clubs registered to play this season.But some women have experienced difficulties in accessing facilities, such as pitches.

Tim Krul, the Norwich goalkeeper, took the acclaim but he had not been overworked by an unusually laboured Bournemouth attack. The Dutchman’s best save was his low stop of an early effort from Dominic Solanke. Krul deflected attention to the contribution of Alex Tettey, whose return to central midfield provided Norwich ballast in front of the defence. Injuries have contributed to their slide into the bottom three and Ben Godfrey limping off in the second half led to Tettey being repurposed into a backline which completed the match without any first-choice central defenders on the pitch. John BrewinIs the writing on the wall for Olivier Giroud? It felt as if Chelsea were crying out for his hold-up play when struggling to break down Newcastle but Frank Lampard’s decision to introduce the more creative Christian Pulisic paid off when the American played a part in Marcos Alonso’s winner. Giroud was an unused substitute again and that could harden his desire to leave in January. The 33-year-old needs to keep his place in France’s squad for Euro 2020 and he had complained about his lack of opportunities during the international break. Lampard insists that Giroud will get chances. “He was bang-on with his quotes when he was away with France,” Chelsea’s manager said. “He shouldn’t be happy and accept not playing. That’s what good players do. I would happily sit down with Oli in January but January is a long way away. I want him here.” Jacob SteinbergIt is 10 matches since Wilfried Zaha scored for Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and his goal against West Ham in February was the only time the forward found the home net throughout last season, despite reaching double figures for the first time in his career. There were some encouraging signs in the defeat against Manchester City on Saturday but Zaha looks as though he is still dwelling over his failed attempt to instigate a transfer in the summer, with Roy Hodgson hoping he can recapture his form ahead of the trip to his summer suitor, Arsenal, on Sunday. With an opportunity to show Unai Emery’s side what they are missing and his 27th birthday approaching next month, Zaha will be only too aware that he must start playing well if he is going to convince anyone to pay what Crystal Palace want to lure him from south London. Ed AaronsThe main topic of discussion had been the Everton midfield pairing of André Gomes and Tom Davies. Specifically, how the two could be overrun or overpowered by their West Ham counterparts given Gomes was making a first start in seven weeks after injury and Davies his first league start of the season. The duo banished the doubts emphatically, injecting much-needed pace and accuracy into Everton’s passing, giving their forwards freedom to break and dominating Declan Rice and Mark Noble in the opposition midfield. Manuel Pellegrini admitted he would have made 11 substitutions at the interval if he could have done, such was the paucity of West Ham’s performance. Everton’s unlikely central midfield duo, forced on Marco Silva by injuries but also a reflection of the manager’s positivity under pressure, were largely responsible for Pellegrini’s dismay. Andy HunterLeicester may be riding high but Brendan Rodgers knows exactly how he wants his team to improve as he urged his young wingers to contribute more goals and assists. Harvey Barnes, 21, created Jamie Vardy’s equaliser before Demarai Gray, 23, crossed for Youri Tielemans’ winner but their manager wants them to be more productive from the start of games. Rodgers said: “Our wingers need to do more. The problem is they are better coming off the bench. This is me being honest. We need more from the players on the sides, so when they come into the game like Demarai, he shows something or does something. We need more from that area both in goals and contributions. There is potential there of course, but there needs to be more efficiency but that’s the beauty of it: they’re young, they have time, they’ll develop and improve.” Peter LansleyEven before his goal Marcus Rashford was showing the vigour and threat he has struggled to deliver since Romelu Lukaku was sold and the 21-year-old became United’s main striker. Once a lethargic Liverpool began to step forward midway through the first half, it opened up the game to the counterattacking that is the one discernible hallmark of Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Extra space provided ideal conditions for Rashford and Daniel James, the combination that supplied the lead United failed to protect. Where lesser opposition have sat deep and then closed down Rashford, following José Mourinho’s uncharitable advice that his former charge will always look to cut on to his right foot, Liverpool were ravaged by him. Adam Lallana’s goal came after Rashford had left the field, exhausted by the efforts of his best performance in a United shirt in months. John BrewinWatford may have drawn a line under their awful start to the season. Quique Sánchez Flores has presided over some disappointing showings since his return so early in the season but after conceding 10 goals in defeats by Manchester City and Wolves, his team have tightened up. The two draws since have been built on more miserly play and Watford stayed compact throughout at Spurs. They will be disappointed in the scrappy way they conceded a late equaliser. Abdoulaye Doucouré was a central figure, an effective screen in front of a new back three, and pivotal in the counterattack, a part of the game where Watford have the ability to hurt opponents more than they have so far. Doucouré sprang the press, carried the ball and read the space well for his goal. Watford need more though, namely a forward who can provide a focal point for transitions. Paul MacInnesIs this season going to be any different for Southampton? A team who have flirted with relegation for the past two seasons occupy 17th after a draw at Wolves (they are above the bottom three on goal difference). Ralph Hasenhüttl insists the result was a step forward and the performance a platform they can build on but there is little evidence that Saints will avoid another fight for survival. Defensively they appear feeble, with Angus Gunn again unconvincing in goal and the 6ft 6in Jannik Vestergaard walked all over by Raúl Jiménez. “We can be critical with a few moments in the second half but we can also be positive about a lot of good habits,” said Hasenhüttl. Danny Ings scored in a fourth consecutive appearance for the first time in his career but Southampton must raise their game if they are to beat Leicester at St Mary’s on Friday. Ben FisherManchester City are still paying the price for their summer’s transfer business when they failed to fill the gaping holes at centre-back, forcing them to field midfielders Rodri and Fernandinho in front of Ederson. They both have all the requisite attributes to operate in the role but they are no more than a stop-gap and moving them away from their natural position is creating problems elsewhere, something that could easily catch up with them against superior opposition than Crystal Palace. Aymeric Laporte is a long-term absentee, while John Stones and Nicolás Otamendi cannot be trusted to enjoy a consistent run in the side, which means Pep Guardiola might need to sort his issues out in January rather than risk missing out on trophies in May. Although it will be pleasing to see his converts impress at centre-back, it’s just papering over cracks that look set to widen without treatment.

Most widely recognised was his success in thawing relations with Eritrea, the breakaway republic with which Ethiopia had remained on a war footing since the country gained independence in 1993.No less significant, however, was his management of the internal conflict between the Ethiopian government and protesters in Oromia, the region surrounding Addis Ababa, the capital. Rather than attempting to shut down the protests by force, Abiy acknowledged their grievances, and opened up political space. He freed political prisoners jailed by previous administrations, and restored the legitimacy of parties formerly branded as terrorist organisations.Almost single-handedly, Abiy appeared to have restored people’s faith in their political institutions. Not only in Addis, but in provincial towns, administrative posts and truck stops across the country, posters and T-shirts bearing his image were proudly displayed, often accompanied by the Amharic word andinet, meaning “unity”. After an assassination attempt in June last year, he impressed by pleading for forgiveness and brotherhood.Among those who saw new hope for the future were members of the country’s pastoralist groups, who had long been accorded a marginal place in Ethiopia – both literally and figuratively – including Somalis, Oromos and many others in the country’s far north, east, south and west. For the first time in their lives, many felt they could have a government that fostered respect among all citizens.“Abiymania” would soon be shaken, however, as new conflicts reared their heads. The system of ethnic federalism, devised as a way of uniting a erse coalition of peoples who had fought against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, had succeeded in bringing people together, but at a cost. Those who found themselves on the wrong side of an ethnically defined border, such as the Gedeo in Oromia, were subject to a new wave of persecution. The resulting conflicts left more people internally displaced than in any other country.If these events received less international coverage than they deserved, others of equal gravity have gone almost entirely unreported. In the past month, government forces have carried out indiscriminate killings in the Lower Omo region. Multiple reports, from independent sources, suggest that among the Bodi ethnic group at least 38 people – including women, children and the elderly – were shot or beaten to death by the military. Women were gang raped. Scores more have disappeared or are in hiding.Among the neighbouring Mursi people, a similar process appears to be underway, with reports of houses set on fire, beatings and treatment that amounts to torture: soldiers forcing people to sit all day in the equatorial sun, and denying men and women the simple dignity of privacy for urinating and defecating.South Omo, where these abuses are occurring, is a site of major infrastructure investments by the Ethiopian state and corporate partners. In 2016 the Gibe III dam was inaugurated upstream. By reducing the river’s natural flood, it allowed large sugar plantations to be established alongside the river, connected to the regional centres by an expanding network of roads.The Bodi and their neighbours were not consulted before these projects began, and lost their lands and livelihoods as plantations, roads and camps for migrant workers were established. The campaign of violence to which the military are now subjecting them threatens to destroy their social fabric entirely.Regardless of who issued the orders, the peace prize bestowed on Ethiopia’s prime minister is a call to halt these atrocities. When Abiy assumed power, it was by riding a wave of discontent over the displacement of poor farming communities around Addis Ababa, whose grievances he – uniquely among senior politicians in the country – had the courage to acknowledge. Whereas the displacement of communities in the vicinity of the capital sparked outrage, the unjust treatment of ethnic minorities has not, so far, attained the status of a popular issue.For the people of the Lower Omo, the situation is desperate. But for Ethiopia and its friends, there is still a chance of salvage. Working for peace, as Abiy well knows, inspires most when it is carried out not in good times – when people are already united – but when power appears to reside with the forces of violence and ision.When Dr Martin Luther King accepted the Nobel peace prize in 1964, he spoke of leaving Oslo “inspired with renewed dedication to humanity”. We hope that, like King, Abiy will interpret the prize not as a capstone to his efforts, but as a commission to work harder than ever for peace and justice. By championing the cause of those on the margins, he would be fulfilling the highest duty of a statesman.• Jed Stevenson is an assistant professor of anthropology at Durham University in the UK.

If you’ve found a dozen and think you’ve done a good job, you probably haven’t – there’ll be at least another dozen hiding.”“Lice are movement-sensitive and scarper when you touch the hair,” warns Wright. Dividing the head into sections helps avoid missing any. Detangle the hair first and use conditioner. Metal combs, especially, can shred inidual hairs, says Burgess. “We have even come across pseudo nits, where the comb has peeled back little knots that look and feel like nits,” he says. “So if you’re going to comb, you need to use a lubricant and do it carefully.”Burgess says that we have known about pesticide-resistant lice in the UK since 1995, yet chemical pesticide treatments are still sold – and frequently recommended by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors. “GPs aren’t listening,” he says. “It’s hardly surprising there are a lot of lice.”Silicone-based shampoo treatments, otherwise known as physical pesticides, may effectively smother the lice, but some of the dreaded nits can survive. “We looked at nearly 1,895 case records,” says Burgess. “Most of those who had baby lice appear after a treatment had them within the first week, but the longest case was 13 days.” Either treat again a week or so later, or keep combing for a few weeks to catch any late hatchers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3db4d67839c09a673aeec3e875743b28bf093ee/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b02ad37c977038ec07ecb0ed48dc1b5a","title":"amazon good review seller bribe poor product","story":"I thought your readers might be interested in my recent experience of buying from Amazon – and what looks like a $20 (£15.60) bribe to leave a great review for what I thought was a poor product.When it arrived it looked, felt and operated poorly.

Martin Kettle reports from Berlin’s Staatsoper, where Daniel Barenboim might be hidden from view, but his Wagner is revelatoryThere was a time when it was unusual for a season to pass in a British opera house without the complete Ring being performed. The first Ring cycle to be mounted in postwar Britain was premiered in 1949 at Covent Garden. Thereafter (with the sole exception of 1952), the Ring, or parts of it, was an annual fixture at the Royal Opera House for two decades. Finally there was a fallow year in 1969. By this time, however, Sadler’s Wells Opera (later English National Opera) was building its own cycle, sung in English. The Ring – or parts thereof – continued to be performed most seasons into the 1980s at both houses, with Welsh National Opera and Scottish Opera also mounting Rings and - just as significantly - touring them around Britain.Little of this period of plenty remains today. This is not to downplay some important recent Ring cycles, such as those put on by Opera North and Longborough festival, or the concert performances at the Proms and elsewhere, let alone the cycle directed by Keith Warner for Covent Garden in 2007 and revived in 2012 and 2018. But the gaps are increasingly large and obvious. Though there are many different causes for this change, the steady decline in Britain’s public subsidy to the opera sector is certainly one of the most decisive in making Wagner’s opera cycle an increasing and sometimes very expensive rarity on our stages. The result is that younger newcomers to the Ring are no longer able to get access to this most important and ambitious of 19th century European musical art works.Today, if you are British and want to see a Ring cycle, you must travel abroad. This might be far from easy and certainly far from cheap, but just as sports fans now routinely head overseas to watch their favourites, so an admittedly smaller number of Wagner lovers now make the journey to overseas Rings too. British visitors were much in evidence at in Berlin this autumn. It is likely that numbers will also be travelling to Paris’s Opéra-Bastille and Chicago’s Lyric Opera in 2020, where new Ring cycles are scheduled.The chief attraction of this autumn’s Berlin Ring was the chance to hear the finest Wagner conductor of the modern era performing the work in his company’s renovated theatre for the first time. Daniel Barenboim has been conducting the Ring half a lifetime. His Bayreuth festival cycle of 1988, directed by Harry Kupfer, established him as the Ring master of his generation. Several notable conductors honed their trade as his assistants, including Christian Thielemann, Antonio Pappano and Philippe Jordan. Now 76, Barenboim has been conducting Guy Cassiers’ production since 2010, both in Berlin and Milan (several in those casts there took part in Barenboim’s 2013 Proms cycle). Until now, however, he has not performed it as a cycle at the historic Berlin State Opera theatre on Unter den Linden, which reopened after an eight-year renovation in late 2017, and of which he is music director.Barenboim remains invisible, Bayreuth-style, in the Staatsoper pit throughout the four parts of the Ring. He takes his bow democratically surrounded by the entire Berlin Staatskapelle orchestra on the stage. But there is never any doubting his commanding grasp and leadership. Where other conductors maybe allow the dynamics to soar too loudly or the musical line to descend into generalities, Barenboim’s control is tight but flexible, and consistently full of contrast, while never losing the musical flow or drawing attention to itself. It is like hearing the work afresh.The result is a rich illumination of orchestral detail and layering that is too often blurred in other performances, and is particularly successful in Das Rheingold. Under Barenboim, scenes which in less skilful hands can be formulaic, like the opening scene of Rheingold or the closing duet in Siegfried, acquire new dramatic clarity, meaning the big moments in Götterdämmerung are reached with a sense of inevitability.The conductor’s art achieved its profoundest climax at the end of Die Walküre, where Barenboim masterly observed Wagner’s often ignored pianissimo markings in the orchestra as Wotan leaves Brünnhilde for the last time. The effect was to express Wotan’s despair, defeat and eclipse in passages of revelatory orchestral restraint, a lesson to all Wagner conductors.Cassiers’s production does not come close to matching Barenboim’s achievement. It is contemporary but also conservative. There is no old-school naturalism, but the treatment also eschews the radical conceptualising that is meat and drink to many European Ring cycles. There are no crashed aeroplanes or biting crocodiles, both of which have featured in recent Rings. The use of dancers intermittently seems to underline important cruxes in the narrative and can broaden the expressive scope, but it is often merely distracting and ultimately lacks conviction. The production represents a dimly lit reversion to the decluttered postwar “new Bayreuth” aesthetic, and at times this Ring is more like a semi-staged concert performance. This can, though, have advantages, since it keeps the focus on the musical drama. It is hard to remember a Ring that so effectively centres on the transition from Wotan’s corrupted world to Brünnhilde’s role as the world’s redeemer.The Berlin cast, a mix of newer and fresher voices with some Barenboim veterans, is close to being as good as you will hear these days. Michael Volle’s Wotan, in particular, is a commanding interpretation, beautifully sung in full voice and articulated without the slightest bark. Iréne Theorin’s Brünnhilde is tireless, accurate and thoroughly up to the job, though the vocal vibrato gets in the way sometimes and she is the chief sufferer from the hampering that is inflicted by Tim van Steenbergen’s costumes. Andreas Schager is the best Siegfried of the current era. Strength in depth is underlined by redoubtable Wagnerians such as Jochen Schmeckenbecher as Alberich, Anja Kampe as Sieglinde, Ekaterina Gubanova as Fricka and Anna Larsson as Erda. The lovelorn giant Fasolt is even sung by 74-year-old Matti Salminen, who sang the role for Colin Davis at Covent Garden 45 years ago and was part of the Patrice Chéreau Ring at Bayreuth in 1976. But it is Barenboim’s show. He can’t go on conducting the Ring forever. But is he does so again, I’ll be there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12031bb0ac340bb6b15ad0e26d500370dcd128dc/0_301_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b652da5e87f12ff265af6c0750b503","title":"how did a town in west virginia become the opioid capital of the us","story":"Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America.

As they publish a book about their campaign, they reflect on their rollercoaster year• Read an extract from Led By Donkeys’ book here“It was like, ‘Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government’s no-deal Titanic,’” exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of Led By Donkeys. “The leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they are claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.”Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for “quite stupefying ignorance” was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government’s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday’s People’s Vote march.Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK’s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove’s face and his comment (“We didn’t vote to leave without a deal”) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach.Stewart smiles. “So it’s like: ‘Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.’ And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: ‘Wow, that’s really impressive!’ So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he’ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.”These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don’t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government in fact, they started the project for “catharsis”: they could either laugh or cry – and they would rather laugh. And that’s still true today.“You just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,” says Stewart. “We have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.”That’s not to say, though, that there isn’t serious intent behind the project. “At the moment, we’re thinking, ‘Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?’” says Stewart. “Look, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?”Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it’s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders’ connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. “It just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,” says Stewart.The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace’s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose – who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives – is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters.No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on “lions led by the donkeys”, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area.The team didn’t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: “We come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we’ve got, and, speaking personally, isn’t that bothered by getting a conviction.”“It felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,” adds Sadri. “It feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.”Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. “It very nearly didn’t continue as a project,” says Knowles, the man up the £90 B\u0026ampQ ladder that night. “We were covered in paste, couldn’t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere.”Stewart bristles a little. “I would describe it as guerrilla-style,” he smiles, then relents. “No, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.”The plan was always to combine the analogue – billboards – with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the  columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them.“I didn’t know anything about it at all,” remembers Hyde, “but as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It’s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea – one of the few things on what I suppose you’d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another ‘letter to the Times from 100 businessmen’.”Led By Donkeys describes what it does as “political theatre” and it’s most effective when, whether it’s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can’t just thumb past it on your smartphone. “People talk about how the problems in today’s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,” says Sadri. “So there’s something about taking a politician’s tweet – something that flies past you at a million miles per hour – and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody’s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: ‘We have to look at that if it’s a sunny day, if it’s pissing with rain.’ And it gives you time to digest it if you’re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.”Going straight hasn’t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved.“I did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,” says Stewart. “So suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn’t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.”Still, even if they are “mired in Excel spreadsheets” now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed “SOS” on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. “Quite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,” noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament’s representative in the Brexit negotiations.“We have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we’re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,” says Knowles. “And our premise is that there’s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren’t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?”The concepts can also become more outsized. “Being in Redcar,” says Rose, “watching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed – that was a different level of excitement.”Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as “secret heroes” of the campaign. But it’s hard to tell what impact, if any, they have had on the political discourse. “I have absolutely no idea!” says Hyde. “I mean it all gets worse, doesn’t it… We know politicians lie or make promises they can’t keep, but that perception seems to have achieved full spectrum dominance on all sides of our political ides. I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.”Posting the politicians’ quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe – “Homosexual acts are wrongful” – on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at “face value”. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can’t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet – but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them.It’s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media – albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. “We’ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet’s gone viral, the local newspaper’s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,” they write in their book. “It’s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.”For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they’re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn’t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and “not let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS”. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn’t have last time. Knowles says: “People have told me, ‘I didn’t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive. And there was passion and emotion behind the Leave campaign.’ Any new campaign has got to get to the things people love and that’s the NHS, values, education and much more positively framed.”If it comes down to passion – well, here, Led By Donkeys think they will be in their element. And even though they are doing things legally these days, the subversive spirit remains. “We are always on the look out for something that would take us back out there,” says Sadri mischievously. “We were slightly disappointed when the government decided to put its ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ posters on digital screens and not on actual physical billboards, because we’d been honing our ‘cut-out giant letters and re-word giant billboards’ technique.”“The ladder is safely stored,” says Knowles, “and is ready to come out again.”• Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit is published by Atlantic (£10).

The tears flowed as he sat in his courtside chair and took in his achievement.“I think it was a great match. Stan was playing unbelievable – hitting winners from all over the court. I just managed to hang in a bit at the end of the second set and the third set was extremely close again. Amazing. I didn’t expect to be in this position at all so I’m very happy.”There has never been a hint of doubt about Murray’s fighting qualities but this four-week run had been a testament to his mentality. A few months ago, after Murray began his singles return in Cincinnati, he looked back at his performances and shook his head. It has been striking to see his improvement as he has gradually won more matches against top players. His movement and serve continue to strengthen.None of that prepared him for the level at which Wawrinka played in this final. He was on a mission from the beginning, serving brilliantly and playing crushing shots indiscriminately off both wings. Murray moved well and constantly to put the Swiss into difficult positions, but each time excellence was required of Wawrinka he came up with something near perfection. Early in the second set he broke with a return game that defied belief. Murray watched four violent winners steam past him. He could do nothing but curse.As in every other moment of his career, he reacted with grit. When Wawrinka was leading 6-3, 3-1 and two break points up his level finally dropped. Murray won seven points in a row thanks to his defence, forays to the net and every last shot in his arsenal. In the tight, breathless games deep into the second set it was Murray’s defence that won the battle.The pressure rose throughout the third set and neither player held serve. Wawrinka fired winners to break twice but Murray’s consistency and defence pegged him back each time and he took control to lead 4-3. When Wawrinka prowled at 4-4 on Murray’s serve, the former world No 1 dug out two more holds, screaming into his fist before breaking for the title.This is the final flourish of a comeback that has defied belief. Nine months ago he was waved out of the Australian Open as his tearful family watched on. Days later he underwent hip resurfacing surgery and just a couple months ago he was still learning how it felt to move freely and chase after balls without sharp, debilitating pain.Wawrinka provided perspective of the size of his success.

Roll up for the mystery tour. On a night of fevered transactional tension at the Sky TV studio complex English cricket rolled out its latest vision of the future. “We’re on the clock and we’re under way,” Ian Ward announced into the camera just before 7pm, firing the starter’s pistol on the inaugural men’s Hundred Draft.Behind him the lighted plinths, the sheer black underway, the thrillingly smooth surfaces of the new crickertainment future stretched out. This was the look of The Draft from the start, a mix of sporting theatre, election night glam and high-end gameshow. The model here isn’t Peter West in his high-backed chair or Tony Lewis waggling his eyebrows. It’s light entertainment, with a nod to those Sunday night, sequin-gled, dance-off segments.“Trent Rockets, you are on the clock now…NOW!!” Isa Guha announced as the cameras cut to the franchise coaches hunched behind their rostrums. Even this was a power play, a lineup of unarguable A-listers, including the great Shane himself, perched at the London Spirit desk and looking, as ever, both gorgeously ravaged and gorgeously primped and styled.Warne had been an early voice of derision about the Hundred, now miraculously persuaded to become the head coach of one its franchises. To be fair, he did a pretty good job here of looking engaged and excited and – crucially – as though he knew what was going on, although the cameras did at one stage seem to show he had his phone on the desk in front of him (“Siri, who the bloody hell is Daryn Smit?”).To their credit both the ECB and Sky were all-in here. An hour before the start the main posse of England players could be seen rolling into town, consciously dressed down in hoodies and high tops, looking like the slightly grizzled end scene from a Blazin’ Squad reunion documentary.Inside a raft of global A-listers basked on white leather sofas. There was Jofra in a pair of impressively huge trainers and Moeen Ali kicking back with all the live TV élan of a man about to be fed to the castle crocodiles.It made for an engaging piece of contrived TV theatre, albeit based largely around reading out the names of cricketers. The Rockets picked Rashid Kahn. The Northern Superchargers went for Aaron Finch, the Welsh Fire Steve Smith. The Southern Braves picked Andre Russell, to the delight of Jofra, and no doubt the TV schedulers in search of some early firepower.In between there was an announcement of some key women’s Hundred players. Meg Lanning went to the Fire, Alyssa Healy to the Superchargers, England duo and recently married couple Nat Sciver and Katherine Brunt will play for the Rockets.As the draft played out it became clear one side-effect would be a degree of wastage at the top end. The player list had promised us Chris Gayle, Kagiso Rabada and Lasith Malinga in the top price bracket. In the event we didn’t get any of them.Instead Liam Livingstone went to the Birmingham Phoenix for double his reserve price. There were major deals for Phil Salt and Tom Abell. Sam Billings, the most Kentish man in Kent, will play for the Oval Invincibles. Ravi Bopara, star of the Blast, went to Birmingham Phoenix. Shakib Al-Hasan, the world’s top T20 all-rounder over the last few years, went unsold to any of the eight franchises.And so it rolled on, opening gambit in either the stupidest event ever staged in the history of English sport, or a refreshingly bold reimagining, depending on your point of view. Both sides of the Hundred culture wars have something to commend them at this stage.For now these are shell company teams in a non-existent format, fuelled by the imagined excitement of an as-yet invisible audience. They laughed at T20, the neo-philes will tell you. They laughed at the IPL. Which is probably true. But then, they also laughed at El Dorado, the Titanic and the Hindenburg airship. Which one will this be?For now just scanning the draft list was slightly dizzying, a roster of 570 professional cricketers, 239 overseas and 331 domestic, an entire generation compressed into a flat white sales brochure. Blake and Blatherwick, Bohannon and Ball. Crook and Coughlin, Warner and Wagg.There was also a reminder here of what this process means for most of these cricketers. By the end of the Men’s Draft 112 contracts had been handed out, 90 of those to domestic cricketers. The ECB has talked about making this an “aspirational” industry. It is also a stratification. The vast majority of English professional cricketers will spend those months playing a shadow game, beyond the lighted stage.It worked, though, for now. The new world is under way. The sense of a machine rumbling into action will be reassuring to all concerned. We have eight box-fresh teams. We have a cast list of players. All the ECB needs now is someone to watch it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde3931782854752812e9a6fdd5e0faadf767a1d/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc28f9fbc13323780d373f48b0a6abc9","title":"japan inspire nation rugby world cup south africa","story":"The Japanese juggernaut finally came to a halt in the face of a South Africa roadblock on Sunday. The sequel to the Brighton miracle lacked the drama and romance of four years ago but this, according to their fans, was when Japan came of age against the world rugby elite.“I think South Africa looked down on Japan four years ago but today they knew they had to be at their best, and that’s a huge compliment to Japan,” said Shigeki Takagi, a company worker from Tokyo who had just witnessed his country play in a World Cup quarter-final for the first time.“We’ve beaten Ireland and Scotland and now I think we’re getting really close to the level of the northern hemisphere teams. Who knows what could happen four years from now?”Susumu Shiratori wiped away tears after the final whistle. “I’m overcome with emotion,” said Shiratori, who had travelled from his home in Shizuoka prefecture, the scene of Japan’s first upset of the tournament, against Ireland in the pool stage. “We may have lost to South Africa but we’ve moved to another level. Beating Ireland and Scotland was one thing – now we want to do the same to England and Wales.”Shiratori confessed he had only recently taken an interest in rugby, but he was not alone. “Everyone’s a fan now,” he said. “It’s such a great sport. The way the players hit each other hard but then show sportsmanship at the end. And the same goes for the visiting supporters – they have been so friendly. It’s been an honour to watch rugby with them.”The home contingent among the crowd of more than 48,000 ned all generations – there were middle-aged couples, groups of teenagers and parents cradling children who may have just been old enough to remember the night that Japan’s extraordinary run came to a noble end. There were as many women as men.Together, they improved even on last weekend’s rendition of Kimigayo. TV viewing figures have increased with each of Japan’s matches and so too, it seems, has the decibel count for the host nation’s national anthem.It is too early to talk convincingly about legacy before the semi-finals have been played, but on the evidence of Sunday night Japan’s commitment to rugby will endure long after the final on 2 November.“We’re so proud of them for getting this far,” said Saho Kitawaki, a senior manager for a firm in Tokyo. “Japan’s win over South Africa four years ago was big for rugby but no one thought it would get this big. They may have lost tonight but they have made history.”Takafumi Tamura, who has followed rugby for a quarter of a century, said: “This is way more than we were expecting, so I’m not sad at all, even though we lost. This was another step forward, and now I can’t wait for the World Cup in France.”Before and after the match the home fans again showed why South Africa’s coach, Rassie Erasmus, felt moved at the end of his press conference to pay tribute to them and their team. Some had sung the South African national anthem, helped by lyrics printed in katakana phonetic script. And at the end they clapped the victors off the pitch and struck up conversations with travelling supporters.Japan’s status as everyone’s second team was evident on the streets around the stadium, where fans in Irish, Welsh and French shirts sported temporary Hinomaru tattoos and hachimaki bandanas. They bore the kanji characters for tokon (fighting spirit), hissho (certain victory) and kamikaze (ine wind). Not all of them were the right way up, but none of the local fans seemed bothered in the slightest.There was little you could dismiss as hyperbole in Bill Beaumont’s pre-match comments. “Japan 2019 is already one of the greatest World Cups, characterised by the incredible warmth and support of the Japanese public,” the World Rugby chairman said. “These figures reflect the power of sport to unite a nation, the awakening of Japan to rugby and how the heroics of the Brave Blossoms have captured hearts and minds around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39603f7396cfe8d6305d13a7386bf0ce67b40336/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2c98a08521d5efa57de162343c2dce8","title":"talking horses magical key to continued success of champions day","story":"The popularity of Champions Day is not purely down to the likes of Frankel after Ascott enjoys another packed houseA standing-room-only train journey down to Ascot on Saturday afforded plenty of time to consider both the continuing popularity of British Champions Day eight years after its arrival in the calendar, and the woeful inability of South West Trains to offer an adequate service on a day that has drawn a bigger crowd than the King George in July every year since 2014. The final attendance figure of 29,029 - a fair proportion of whom seemed to be in my carriage – was a few hundred down on 2018, but still impressive given a very mixed weather forecast for the afternoon and, if we’re honest, a slight lack of “star” names in the Group One events when compared to some previous years.In the end, this made no difference to anyone, just as the decision to switch three races to the hurdles went unnoticed as soon as Kew Gardens and Straarius settled down to battle it out in the Long Distance Cup. Never mind the weather or the cast list, a crowd of around 30,000 for Champions Day is now apparently guaranteed - a huge increase on the 12,500 who saw the last Champion Stakes at Newmarket in 2010.Just over 32,000 were at Ascot to see Frankel conclude his flawless career in the same race two years later, a Champions Day record that is unlikely to be beaten any time soon. But at the same time, this could be seen as evidence that the old argument that “horses like Frankel are the lifeblood of the sport” is slightly wide of the mark. They make a difference, for sure, but perhaps not quite as big a difference as some might suggest.Champions Day has built up a loyal, reliable attendance of around 30,000 people from pretty much a standing start, and done it less than 10 years. And while Frankel was undoubtedly a big draw in the early years, the success of subsequent seasons is down to a major investment in branding and marketing which has built on Ascot’s status as the top Flat track in the country.There was a strong sense on that overcrowded train on Saturday that most of the people on it were not just going to the races. They were going to Ascot races, because the name comes with something close to a guarantee of exciting, competitive action in a historic venue. The Ascot brand sells the day as much as the promise of “Champions”.On that basis, a horse like Magical, the Champion Stakes winner, is as important for the event as a freakish once-in-a-lifetime superstar like Frankel.Champions Day is the third of four big end-of-season events in the northern hemisphere in the space of eight weeks, starting with Champions Weekend in Ireland and moving on to Ascot via Arc day in Paris before the Breeders’ Cup (which returns this year to Santa Anita in California, always a big favourite with owners and trainers alike).Few horses are sufficiently robust and reliable to run up to their best at all four – Found, like Magical a filly from the Aidan O’Brien stable, is the only recent example that springs to mind. And Magical could well prove to be another, with the Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf pencilled in for her final start of the season if she comes out of Saturday’s race as fresh and keen as she has after her previous eight outings this year.With Champions Day falling between the Arc and the Breeders’ Cup and ground on the softer side of good likely if the first nine seasons are any guide, owners and trainers are always likely to feel that if it is a choice of two from three, France and then America gives their horses more time to recover.Horses that are able to take their races as Magical does are invaluable in terms of maintaining the quality of the big autumn meetings, and while, unlike Frankel, she will never get a statue at Ascot, she did just as he did on Saturday to maintain the success of Britain’s richest day at the races.Windsor closes its doors for another winter after its seven-race card this afternoon, and its balmy midsummer Monday evenings will feel like a very distant memory as the runners slosh round on rain-softened ground. The conditions may detract somewhat from the spectacle, but Field Of Vision (2.00) should appreciate the test having put up his best run for a while on heavy ground at Leicester last time out.Prince Of Harts (4.00) also ran well on soft at Nottingham back in May and could reward an interest at around 9-2 later on the card, while Milan Reef (5.00) is another who should relish the conditions if handicaps for gentleman amateur riders’ are your thing.The curtain is coming down at Pontefract too, where Glasses Up (3.20) should go well at around 8-1 as he steps back up to a mile-and-a-quarter after a promising run over a mile at Musselburgh last time. King Carney (3.50) improved markedly to get off the mark on soft ground at Nottingham earlier this month and registered a decent time in the process, so 8-1 could be a price worth taking for the card’s feature race, while Magen’s Moon (3.10) can follow up her surprise win over course and distance last time out in the handicap hurdle at Plumpton.

Twelve months ago, the Yorkshireman was in the wilderness, serving a 14-month ban for drugs use before being convicted of drink‑driving, a few weeks before he was due to return with Wigan. His previous included a five-match ban imposed in 2014 for homophobic abuse. Now, having celebrated his 28th birthday while flying to the southern hemisphere, he is returning to international rugby with the Lions.Calling Hardaker’s career turbulent does not even begin to scratch the surface but this year feels somewhat different for the former Leeds and Castleford full‑back. In January, Hardaker told the Observer on the eve of his comeback how he was eager to prove he had finally learned his lesson and that he was a changed man once and for all. Does a call-up for Great Britain – who kick off their four-game tour, their first since 2006, with a match against a Tongan XIII on Saturday – show he was a man of his word?“That’s for everyone else to decide,” he says. “It’s a day‑to-day process for me and for a lot of people looking at me. I’m always learning and I understand what I’ve done means I’ll be in the public eye for the rest of my career. But I would like to think I’ve shown this year that there is a different side to me.”Hardaker’s first season with Wigan has been impressive. The 2015 Man of Steel was instrumental in the Warriors’ mid-season revival, which took them to within one game of the Super League Grand Final.“It took me a bit longer than I thought it would to get back up to speed,” he says. “But I got there in the end and so did the team. I just wanted to repay Wigan for signing me and show people there is a different side to me.”Despite his excellent end-of-season form, the Lions call came as a surprise to everyone, especially given he had not been involved in the England training squad this year.“I’d resigned myself to going on holiday and watching the Great Britain lads on telly,” he says, smiling. “You do start to worry if you’ll ever get the call again, and wonder if everything that’s happened has gone against you.“To be honest, I admitted defeat in terms of a call-up earlier in the year. Now, to be on the tour is beyond my wildest dreams. But it doesn’t mean I’m back. There’s still lots of work to do and, like I say, it’s still very much a day‑to-day process.”Having never held a conversation with the Great Britain coach, Wayne Bennett, before his call-up, Hardaker’s opportunities to perform in a squad littered with players in a similar position could be limited. But having come so far in such a short space of time, the opportunity just to impress Bennett is one Hardaker is understandably savouring.“I don’t really know where Wayne sees me in terms of my position,” he says. “But give me any number, any position … to play for Great Britain after all that’s happened? I’m lucky, I know that.“To be back in the international fold is incredible but there’s so much more to come. Most importantly, my family are proud of how far I’ve come and it’s little moments like that which allow you to take a step back and see how much things can change in a year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffd728a1dd6fa63c934357f81f5c720bc785a111/0_180_3389_2033/master/3389.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1112ba7817e73c61b41c4b09853483","title":"shoes nike world records technology","story":"It is the shoes, stupid. Anyone who says otherwise is deluded.Without those chunky, super-fast prototype Nike alphaFLYs – the ones with platforms to make Ziggy Stardust swoon – Eliud Kipchoge does not shatter the two-hour marathon-distance barrier in Vienna.And without the key-lime-pie-coloured consumer version, £239.99 from your nearest Nike store, legions of club runners are not lopping chunks off their personal bests either.But I have news for the athletes and agents who have approached the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, urging it to ban the shoes. It is not going to happen. In fact do not be surprised if the arms race in shoe technology soon goes nuclear.Why? Well, on Monday the IAAF’s technological committee – which has been studying Nike’s Vaporfly shoes since 2017 – will hold an important conference call involving scientists from the University of Queensland and legal experts. While its thinking is a closely guarded secret, there is no hint the Vaporflys will be banned. Instead, I understand it is considering making a proposal to the IAAF council in the next two to three weeks that a running shoe should be regarded as legal providing it gives no “motor assistance” to an athlete. In other words, if the only power source remains the person running in the shoes, they would be legally compliant.Some will shrug their shoulders. Sport and technology have, after all, always gone hand in hand. A friend of mine in cycling points out that Ineos are using wheels from Germany, costing £6,000 a pair, that are lighter and stiffer than those used by other teams. That is an undoubted advantage. My friend also suggests modern bicycle tyres are worth 40 seconds on Alpe d’Huez over those from 20 years ago, another sign of how technology inevitably rewrites the rules and the record books.But athletics is supposed to be different. With the odd exception – such as the switch away from cinder tracks – technological innovation tends to be subtle and incremental. Tell someone you are a three-hour marathon runner and that means much the same whether you did it in 1985 or 2015. But remarkable as Kipchoge’s run in Vienna undoubtedly was we have no way of knowing how much was down to him – and how much was the impact of his shoes.We know the Vaporflys may have producing sliding-doors moments in major races. In the 2016 US Olympic marathon trials the Nike athletes Amy Cragg and Shalane Flanagan came first and third wearing early prototypes of the Vaporflys while Kara Goucher, who was not, missed out by one place. The gap between Flanagan and Goucher? Sixty five seconds.True, other brands like Saucony and New Balance are rumoured to be close to unveiling similar shoes. But Nike has been so far ahead for the past three years you wonder how much the gap will really close.And it is not just on the road. At the recent world championships in Doha, Sifan Hassan and Laura Muir were among a number of athletes who ran startling times wearing prototype Nike spikes – though the heat of competition, the lack of wind and a lightning-quick track helped too.So what should be done? Clearly it would be legally tricky to ban the Vaporflys given they have been so widely used for nearly three years. So instead the question will become how to find the sweet spot between encouraging innovation without destroying the time-worn characteristics of track and field: universality and fairness.One reasonable suggestion, made in the British Journal of Sports Medicine by Geoffrey T Burns and Nicholas Tam, is to introduce rules to regulate the thickness of the midsole of a shoe. “If set at 31mm current competition footwear would remain eligible and advances would take place within this geometry, ensuring footwear remains an accessory to physiological competition,” they argue.As Burns and Tam also point out, similar rules regarding heel thickness for shoes are already used in high jump and long jump competitions. And by adopting a similar approach for running shoes it would “provide a transparent standard that supersedes the band-aid approach of litigating every new development”.But whatever the IAAF does next, it must more closely observe its own rule 143.2, which states shoes “must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage”.Yes, the playing field in sport is never going to be truly level but it cannot remain obviously lopsided either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e720485621a9b32c30c11df10e5654f3e213129c/0_117_1744_1046/master/1744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b842de74b04c3a1ac5fa60e69a3eaef","title":"american utopia review david byrne starts making sense","story":"The country is far from perfect, a Broadway audience will not chant the names of black Americans killed by police. The singer presses onMore than a concert and less than a musical, a one-man show with a full backing band, American Utopia brings David Byrne – gray-haired, gray-suited, barefoot, magnificent – to Broadway. A loose agglomeration of songs, sometimes linked by brief monologues and get-out-the-vote exhortations, it is both an introduction to Byrne’s particular psychology and catalogue and an oblique consideration of America today and how it might be bettered. Resistance is musical.The show curtain is designed by Maira Kalman. When it disappears, the stage is bare except for Byrne, seated at a table and holding a brain. As he sings Here, the final track on his recent solo album, also called American Utopia, a back-up singer (Chris Giarmo) enters, then another (Tendayi Kuumba), a bassist (Bobby Wooten III, a pocket sun) follows, a guitarist (Angie Swan, sharkskin cool), percussionists and soon the stage is thronged with bodies, all in gray suits, all barefoot.Mounds of metal rise and become a shimmering curtain while the lyrics explore neural connection: “Here is an area of great confusion Here is a section that’s extremely precise And here is an area that needs attention Here is a connection with the opposite side.” The noise is very joyful.Sometimes Byrne speaks between songs, sometimes he doesn’t, sometimes he takes up a guitar, sometimes he simply sings. There is no director but Alex Timbers, who collaborated with Byrne on the thrilling Here Lies Love and the mortifying Joan of Arc: Into the Fire, is listed as a production consultant.Byrne’s voice has never been particularly flexible, but it remains forceful. His presence has become more avuncular, less alien, like the ringmaster of an extremely well-behaved circus. He and the band perform Annie-B Parson’s angular, energetic choreography, some of it adapted from Byrne’s concert moves. The lighting, by Rob Sinclair, moves from white to red to blue.The songs are fascinated by the furniture of adult life – a job, a girlfriend, a house, a car – while standing slightly apart from it. The monologues explore Byrne’s slight alienation from these things – “Me, I just observe and pay attention and watch,” he says – moving gradually into more political concerns.There’s no arc to the show, no narrative, though any of the monologues center on the idea of connection. Connection doesn’t come naturally to Byrne, who has discussed his autism. With his gentlemanly remove, it’s not always clear what Byrne wants from the audience (attention, common cause) or what the audience wants from him, besides the hits.A little more than halfway through the evening, Byrne reminds everyone that they have permission to dance as long as the aisles remain clear. At a preview, when the musicians began noodling the Burning Down the House intro, nearly every foot was leapt to. But during the next song, a cover of Janelle Monae’s protest anthem Hell You Talmabout, a call-and-response was initiated, with spectators asked to repeat the names of black Americans killed by the police or in acts of racial violence – Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Atatiana Jefferson. Few answered.The word utopia can mean “good place” or it can mean “no place”. American Utopia somehow embraces both etymologies. Onstage it incarnates a very good place, welcoming, communal, in harmony. But can that place find purchase in the larger world? Maybe not in this lifetime.Byrne quotes James Baldwin: “I still believe we can do with this country something that has not been done before.” And in the jubilant encore song, Byrne sings, as the musicians march around the stage, about the city in his mind.“Would you like to come along,” he asks. “You can help me sing the song.” But would they really help? And that song? It’s Road to Nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa38bcdb199b8f211187f0c8f8fc66f9c6a8d95/303_197_4583_2750/master/4583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f37e6bbb0e1b2a3f4035d39e4f6119","title":"peter brook truman capote broadway","story":"Inspired by a magical ballet, I gathered a peerless writer, a top composer and Broadway’s most vibrant star. But even renowned directors can get it badly wrong…‘Broadway” and “Hollywood” have long been words of derision. So I take a secret pleasure in telling people who speak movingly of the impact on them of the Midsummer Night’s Dream that I put on in Stratford, London and New York in the early 70s that the great influence that made this possible was my experience on Broadway.Every year back then I would find a reason to go to New York. By contrast with the stately, unchanging, middle-class London theatre, Broadway was vibrating with new people, new ways, new life. Of course, the often ruthless aim was success: great notices on the opening night or else the show had no chance of survival. But in exchange, all the very best talent flocked to Broadway. And it wasn’t all musicals the straight theatre too had the top adventurous new talents – Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee – and groundbreaking directors like Elia Kazan.But the great magnet in New York was indeed the musical. After years of being a cosy entertainment for tired businessmen and their wives came Oklahoma!, South Pacific, and on to the unforgettable shocks of West Side Story and Guys and Dolls! Here, the Shakespeare model was incarnate: never to lose the common touch. So a hit could travel round the world and become a household name.For me, there were two experiences inseparable from Broadway. One was the first visit of the Chinese acrobats. They demonstrated that the way to suggest the fairies of the spirit world was not with pretty, transparent costumes on girlish dancers. It was by evoking lightness with seemingly effortless acrobatics. The other eye-opener came from Jerome Robbins. The musical called on top choreographers to bring a new life to the customary routines of the operetta, to develop their own dancers in their own way. Robbins was already one of the luminaries of the New York City Ballet. His new work was called Dances at a Gathering. A small group of dancers are discovered round a piano. The pianist began to play the first notes, notes that belonged to the ballet world – Chopin. The dancers were all dressed in simple, white, everyday clothes. Gone was the moonlight, the painted trees, the tutus. Gradually, as though responding for the first time to the notes, they left the piano and, in an unchanging bright light, there flowed a series of pas de deux for man and girl, easing into wider animation when the whole ensemble left the piano to make patterns of light movement.When we needed to find a path to the hidden life of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, my constant collaborators, the composer Richard Peaslee and the designer Sally Jacobs, had long been fed our own experiences in our workshops, but what Broadway gave us was the need and the courage to develop what we had begun to discover.Truman Capote, a young gay writer whose books were on every coffee table, had proposed turning his own short story House of Flowers into a musical. He would write the script and the lyrics for a top composer, Harold Arlen, famous for Judy Garland’s Over the Rainbow among other hits. Also joining the team was no less than George Balanchine, the purest of choreographers. And our star was the most vibrant Broadway actress, singer Pearl Bailey. Our young New York producer could sleep happily: it could not go wrong. But it did. How could such a seeming hit become a flop? I began painfully to discover the unknown rules of Broadway.In all my London experiences, the director was the top dog and had the final say on how a show should be made all the elements – cast, music, settings – were the director’s territory. In the London theatre jargon of the time the director was called the producer. (Director was a business term, referring to the managing director of a company.) Of course, above the producer was the management, who usually owned or had long-term deals with the theatres. Naturally, the producer would listen to their comments and happily accept good advice from experienced eyes with a certain detachment. New York was a very different scene. The person called the producer had become the absolute boss. He was the management, and he found and provided the cash. By contrast, the person called the director could, like all the team, be hired and fired at the producer’s whim. Before opening on Broadway, a show would often go for an out-of-town try-out – a valuable system allowing changes to be made but also a ruthless process whereby writers, actors and directors could be sent packing overnight. On my very first trip to New York I was the guest of a top producer who was interested in a show we were doing in London. He kindly offered to get me a ticket for the musical that everyone was talking about. I was very disappointed by it, and when I saw him the next day I began to give him my criticisms. He cut me off sharply. “Nonsense!” he said, “It’s the hottest seat in town!”I gradually learned the tremendous advantage of creating a play in the secure conditions of the London West End, and if it happened to click, it would be that very production which enterprising producers would invite to New York. With House of Flowers I learnt that the American musical had a complex series of rules, unknown to the visiting director. Truman Capote had never written a musical, so it was the responsibility of the director to coach him, rewrite after rewrite, until his script conformed to what Broadway musicals demanded. Step by step, composer, choreographer, designer knew that they too had to conform to what was demanded of them by the all-knowing eye of the man who paid – the producer.Harold Arlen and Capote’s first attempts at lyric writing were far from what an audience had been conditioned to expect. Marlene Dietrich was such a friend and fan of Arlen that she moved in to encourage and guide him through a show-business world that she knew only too well.Pearl Bailey was a long-established singing star – and was in no way convinced by the other unformed but talented singers in the cast, mostly recruited from the West Indies. I saw the unbridgeable distance between these two worlds in rehearsal when she came to me to pour out her anger against a young singer who dared to take herself too seriously: “Who does she think she is? She carries on as though she’s a star. I tried to slap her down, to get some sense into her. So I said to her, ‘You think you’re a star? Just listen to me, honey! If you’re a star, just tell me – where are your furs, where are your diamonds, where are your cars?’’And as we rehearsed, our poor young producer, watching me at work, did not feel he had the authority to step in and say to me: “No! You’re getting it wrong.” He just sat and suffered. And of course the show could not come together.The story was a good one. The House of Flowers was a brothel in the port of a Caribbean island. A group of enchanting ladies were the Flowers. At the rise of the curtain they were sitting sadly hoping for a ship to bring some customers. Arlen had given them an enchanting chorus that began: “Waiting. Waiting. Waiting, it is so irritating. Waiting for a ship to come by.” Then the story started with cockfights and voodoo. By the time the show had – very rapidly – given up the ghost, I had already left for Europe, but my greatest disappointment was that the score was so quickly forgotten. For years, in Paris, I hoped to make a musical free of Broadway pressures. However I had already been deeply immersed in the world of musicals in the free atmosphere of London at the time.Popular music is always a guide. When the great American musicals swept across the world, neither London nor Paris had anything to compare, and we realised how poor our old-fashioned forms of musical theatre had become. A new young generation began to explore what could be alive for them then. Deep in the world of rock, they were to make musicals that did not copy American models."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07c2c1ea68d309df8c5aaf5d541d80d45168787c/0_176_5352_3212/master/5352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5fd62cee2316e19c2bb2520367ed56b","title":"security freedom inside loo 10 years council housing","story":"The number 151 probably doesn’t have much significance for most people, but to my family it instantly conjures a smile and a nostalgic gaze into the middle distance.For my parents, 151 provided an opportunity to bring up their children in their own home and to escape the restrictions of sharing a house with mum’s father and his partner, as they’d done for the first seven years of marriage. For us children – Maxine, Paul and me – 151 brought seven “green and golden” years to our 1950s childhood: playing with friends in the garden or indoors singing and dancing to records on the radiogram helping around the house and running free and safe in the streets and green spaces of a new council estate on the eastern edge of Cardiff.Like many estates in postwar Britain, Llanrumney was planned in a spirit of optimistic reconstruction, holding on to some of the principles of the garden-city movement. Houses were brick-built in small rows rather than the long, dark-stone terraces associated with inner-city Victorian workers’ housing. Decent-sized front and rear gardens offered the opportunity to grow vegetables and to plant shrubs and flowers. Communal green spaces lent an open, airy aspect, as did the playing fields of Rumney Rec and the woodlands of legend-haunted Llanrumney Hall.In spring 1953 we were one of the first families on the estate. Dad had to go to work the day we moved in because he couldn’t afford a day off, so he cycled to Wagon Repairs Ltd in the docks, where he was a carpenter, while Johnny Workman’s van moved whatever possessions we had to 151. A concrete path led to the porch and blue door downstairs, a front room for best, a hallway and kitchenette, a small living room at the back upstairs, three bedrooms and bathroom. A bonus was “the outhouse”: with a separate front entrance, it was a passageway to the back garden, big enough to store coal, bikes, tools, paint, toys, etc, as well as having – wonder of wonders! – a second toilet.Our neighbours were couples in their 30s who’d survived the war and started young families – the Fletchers, Checketts, Wickhams and the Carrs in the corner house with the big front garden and garage. Friendships came easily. With hardly any traffic, we organised noisy street games such as touch, hopscotch and “Please Jack, may I cross the water?”, stretched a rope across the road and chanted skipping rhymes, roller-skated down the hill, sprinted to the lamp-post and back, or spent all day down the Rec playing football, cricket and baseball – the Welsh version, native only to Cardiff, Newport and Liverpool over the border.Perhaps it’s a boy’s-eye view, but our parents didn’t seem anxious about us venturing all over the estate on our bikes or wandering down to Rumney River where the bridge at the end of Ball Lane gave access to open countryside.It’s still largely taboo to talk negatively about social housing. Those who had places to sleep affordably – no matter how damp or dangerous or stricken with social problems – are meant to be grateful.Before I turned 16, I lived on eight different council estates, big and small, north and south, as well as homeless B\u0026ampBs, housing association flats and small private rentals designed for housing benefit recipients. My single mum with two children in tow was often shuttled to the top of the housing list. We were usually put in the flat no one wanted, on the estates that would be no one’s preference. Flats on the top floor with no working lift ones by the communal bins for hundreds of people a ground-floor flat with damp so thick I used to draw pictures in it with my finger while trying to sleep. Estates where rubbish was left to pile up, and crime, violence or drugs went unchecked. Compared with the alternative, social housing where we knew we would not be evicted, where the housing benefit would suffice, where if something went wrong with our flat we could ask for it to be fixed (even if it might take many months), was a better option by far.So, I am grateful for those things. The problem is that as I got older I went into the wider world and came to understand how badly we had been failed by those who held the purse and power strings. That utopian dream of decent, affordable housing for all became a dystopian reality.Of course, you’re welcome to disagree, but then I’ll ask you to tell me something, anything, more dystopian than watching 72 social-housing tenants die in a tower of flames in the fifth richest city in the world. Grenfell happened because the residents were poor, ignored and no one gave a shit.If we are to campaign for more social housing, let it be social housing which is fit for purpose, designed to be a home for a community of happy, productive citizens. Integrate it with the community and amenities, imagine not that the folk living there will be staying home all day watching Cash In The Attic, but that they will have jobs to go to, friends and family to see, purses full of cash that they want to spend in the high street. Imagine the children growing up on that estate will become your future politicians, doctors, broadcasters, artists and scientists – so make sure they can get to school safely, that they’ll remain physically and mentally healthy, and that they like where they live so much that they will choose to stay and contribute to a community they are grateful for.After her orce, my mother chose to move to Bristol. We lived in one room in a house of multiple occupation in Easton for more than a year in 1975-6 and shared a bed that was no more than a big piece of foam on the floor.Aged 11, I befriended an older girl at Lawrence Weston comprehensive school who was also dating the local hard man. I was not untouchable, but I did now have someone to watch over me, as no one messed with “Sally”. My quick wits meant I made a range of friends from different backgrounds. You could count the number of black families on the estate on one hand.Due to my mother’s insistence I addressed all my friends’ parents as “Mr” or “Mrs”. This meant I often got invited to “tea”, something my West Indian upbringing had no reference of, but I intrinsically knew was an important occasion. While I played with their children, these various parents would fill the gaps in the void left by the rest of my family being more than 120 miles away in London. We lived without fear of life’s everyday dangers. Soon we had a tight gang of kinship rather than terror. We fought, argued, laughed and cried together. The youth clubs, boxing gyms and a plethora of sporting clubs kept most of us away from the glue-sniffers, speed-freaks and junkies.I miss the banter and camaraderie of life on the estate. It could be vicious, yet have the most acerbic observational humour of the finest stand-up comedians. It certainly helped to build my character, sharp tongue and canny pragmatic skills in response to an array of insults and challenges. There were no safe spaces and this sink-or-swim approach to growing up is not recommended for the faint-hearted.As I grew older, I became more aware of the ritual racist abuse. I recall one vicious attack that took place when I was alone at a bus stop, which left me physically and mentally scarred. It was carried out by two assailants who shouted “nigger” at me, iniduals who hated what they didn’t understand. I was lucky, I got up: Stephen Lawrence in similar circumstances did not.Clint Eastwood was our hero back then and I describe my time in Lawrence Weston as “the Good, the Bad and the Ugly”. The reality for a skinny, small black kid on the brink of adolescence without immediate family or friends meant life was tough, but it was also the making of this man.The day we got the keys, I burst into the house, darted through the kitchen, ran up the stairs and headed straight for the room at the end of the landing.Out of breath, I opened the door, walked tentatively in and closed it behind me. Everything smelled new. The bath, white and glistening, was to the right, the sink straight ahead, and the toilet to the left beside a small radiator. I was amazed.This was to be our family’s first bathroom. The home we were leaving was a two-up-two-down Victorian terraced house in the lower Falls Road area of west Belfast, with no central heating, no bathroom and riddled with damp. The toilet was outside in the yard.I was seven-and-a-half when we were told there was a new four-bedroom house for my parents and the six of us children to move into just a few streets away. Other things I remember: the aroma of naked wood and freshly applied plaster lots of doors and built-in cupboards in which to store things large windows the excitement of a garden back and front the small playground right outside the door with climbing bars the anticipation of the friends I would make and the things we would do in this place, which was filled with newly planted trees in the streets and places to play.What I soon came to understand was that the new estates springing up in and around Belfast in the mid-to-late 1970s were a response to poor housing, and also to the historical discrimination that meant the Protestant majority experienced favourable allocation of council housing while those from Catholic backgrounds were left behind. Many families had also been displaced due to violence and sectarian intimidation related to the Troubles.What I now know is that the rehousing process resulted in even greater segregation of the two communities and that this had longer-term ramifications for sectarianism and ision, including the emergence of “peace lines” along what are called “interface areas”, where largely Catholic and Protestant working-class communities border one another. These walls remain a prominent feature of many Belfast communities today.My early years living on our council estate included watching as a massive brick “peace wall” was constructed across one perimeter. It was a security decision. There were frequently pitched battles between people on both sides of the ide sometimes they involved shooting. Over time, however, other walls went up. Parts of the estate – which had felt open and accessible when we first moved in – were cordoned off by a series of smaller walls that made it difficult to enter or exit certain areas. When I returned to visit family and friends on as a young adult, it was beginning to feel more like a containment area than a housing estate.Homes for Heroes 100: Council Estate Memories, published as part of last week’s Festival of the Future City in Bristol, supported by funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Bristol City Council.

Sixty Walmart-owned outlets were vandalised, and the company said many stores did not open during the day. Five more people were later found dead in the basement of a burned warehouse and were not employees, authorities said.At least two airlines cancelled or rescheduled flights into the capital, affecting more than 1,400 passengers Sunday and Monday.“We are at war with a powerful, relentless enemy that respects nothing or anyone and is willing to use violence and crime without any limits,” the president, Sebastián Piñera, said on Sunday in an unscheduled speech from the military headquarters.Piñera, a billionaire conservative who served as president between 2010 and 2014 before taking office again in March 2018, is facing the worst crisis of his second term.On Saturday night, he announced he was cancelling a subway fare rise imposed two weeks ago. The fare increase led to major protests that included rioting that caused millions of dollars in damage to buses, subway stops, office buildings and stores.After meeting the heads of the legislature and judicial system earlier on Sunday, Piñera said they discussed solutions to the crisis and that he aimed “to reduce excessive inequalities, inequities abuses, that persist in our society”.Jaime Quintana, the president of the senate, said “the political world must take responsibility for how we have come to this situation”.Authorities said 10,500 soldiers and police officers were patrolling the streets in Santiago as state of emergency and curfew remained in effect for six Chilean cities, but protests continued during the day on Sunday. Security forces used teargas and jets of water to try disperse crowds.The interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, reported that 62 police officers and 11 civilians were injured in the latest disturbances and prosecutors said nearly 1,500 people had been arrested. He said late on Sunday there had been more than 70 “serious events” during the day, including more than 40 looting incidents.With transportation frozen, Cynthia Cordero said she had walked 20 blocks to reach a pharmacy to buy nappies, only to find it had been burned down. “They don’t have the right to do this,” she said, adding it was right to protest “against the abuses, the increases in fares, against bad education and an undignified pension, but not to destroy”.Long queues formed at petrol stations as people tried to fill up for a coming workweek with a public transport system disrupted by the destructive protests. Santiago’s subway, which carries an average of 2.4 million passengers on a weekday, had been shut down since Friday.The Subway system chief, Louis de Grange, said workers would try to have at least one line running on Monday, but he said it could take weeks or months to have the four others back in service. He said 85 stations and more than three-quarters of the system had been severely damaged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ea339bca3ac96ab616f8807bfdcb029f960d5c/0_267_3981_2388/master/3981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c986b41fbc102af4653a8c323f2db3","title":"two green parties on track for gains in swiss elections","story":"Environmentalists’ vote share soars but anti-immigrant Swiss People’s party remains largest Switzerland’s Green Party have made historic gains in national elections, while the anti-immigrant rightwing remained the largest party in parliament despite a slip in its support.Definitive results confirmed a pre-vote forecast that rising concerns about climate change would trigger an electoral “green wave”.The results mark “a tectonic shift”, said Green Party president Regula Rytz, and the leftwing party called for the “urgent convening of a national climate summit”.“It’s more than a wave, it’s a tidal wave on the Swiss scale,” political scientist Pascal Sciarini told AFP.Focus will swiftly turn to whether the Greens – or a coalition of the two environmentalist parties – will demand one of the seven cabinet positions that are shared among the leading political parties.University of Lausanne political scientist Oscar Mazzoleni told AFP the results showed that the SVP struggled to attract young voters while its ageing electoral base was less motivated to vote than in 2015, when Europe’s migrant crisis was on “page one”.The SVP is also the only major party that has not pledged to pursue bolder climate action, having consistently denounced “climate hysteria” in Swiss politics.Aside from warning about the threats of immigration, the SVP has also built its brand by condemning the influence of the European Union in Switzerland, which is not an EU member.Under Switzerland’s unique political system, the election decides the 200 lower house lawmakers and 46 senators elected to four-year terms, but the make-up of the executive Federal Council will not be decided until December.Under the so-called “magic formula” for power sharing, six cabinet seats are shared equally by the SVP, the Socialist Party and the right-leaning Free Democratic Party (PLR), with the centrist Christian Democrats holding the seventh seat. The presidency rotates each year.The Greens finished fourth, narrowly beating the Christian Democrats, but it remains unclear when they will join the cabinet.Swiss governance relies heavily on consensus, and many have voiced reluctance to removing the Christian Democrats, who have served in cabinet since the formula was implemented in 1959 and represent Switzerland’s centrist bloc.The leftwing Greens would rather take a Federal Council seat from the right-leaning PLR, but may have to form a tricky alliance with the Green Liberals to do so.But party leader Rytz made clear that she believes the Greens belong in government. “Now is the time,” she said, adding that Swiss leaders “may need to discuss a new magic formula” to reflect changing political priorities.Sunday’s results provided further evidence that a nation whose economy and lifestyle are closely tied to the country’s stunning snow-capped peaks has grown increasingly concerned about the ravages of climate change.A recent study by Zurich’s ETH university found that more than 90 percent of 4,000 glaciers dotted throughout the Alps could disappear by the year 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/656e59e6a370196f678699661c358c5154462a85/0_9_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f75453310a89d45312821fde9699776","title":"canada election justin trudeau smaller parties","story":"Forty days of campaigning may have knocked the shine off Justin Trudeau but no party appears likely to capture a majorityAs Canadians head to the polls on Monday, Justin Trudeau is bracing for the possibility of an electoral loss, marking a stunning turn of fortunes for the charismatic Liberal leader who had pledged to reshape the country’s politics.With the the prime minister’s weakness exposed, smaller parties are fighting to emerge as power brokers in a general election that experts believe may produce no clear winner.In the closing days of the campaign, Trudeau acknowledged that there was a good chance the opposition Conservatives could take more votes, but after 40 days of frantic campaigning, no party appears set to capture the 170 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons.“The race is very tight. I keep thinking I’m seeing the outcome – and then something happens that makes me believe maybe that’s not going to happen,” said Frank Graves, head of political polling firm Ekos Research Associates.Part of the reason for the deadlock is a campaign which experts say was devoid of bold ideas from the two main parties, and was instead defined by self-inflicted wounds: images emerged showing Trudeau in blackface, while the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, was accused of concealing the fact that he also holds a US passport.“There’s really been an absence of hard policy questions, even though it’s supposed to be the ‘climate change election’. It’s not like we don’t have anything to talk about,” said Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. “Instead, we spent much of the campaign talking about blackface, stupid things people said on Twitter and Andrew Scheer’s citizenship.”While the prime minister was quick to apologize over the blackface images, his rivals used the embarrassing revelations to accuse him of insincerity.“Mr Trudeau, you are a phoney and you’re a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country,” said Scheer during one official debate.But Scheer, a social conservative, was also forced to deflect accusations that a Conservative government would undermine access to abortion, after telling reporters he was anti-choice.He also faced repeated questions over his commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, after the Liberal party highlighted his previous opposition to gay marriage.In the final days of the campaign, Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the leftwing New Democratic party, surged following well-received debate performances. The 40-year-old Singh has been able to draw large crowds with his optimistic campaign – and robbed much of the Green party’s support.“Singh has come out of this election smelling like a rose,” said Graves. “He’s really put himself on the map.”Despite the negative campaigning by both the Liberals and Conservatives, Trudeau has tried to centre the election around the environment, with the prime minister pitching himself as a climate leader facing down the Conservatives, who have pledged to repeal the country’s carbon tax.Neither message, however, doesn’t appear to be resonating with voters.“In an election where the government is going into its second term, it’s often a referendum on governance. But I don’t get that sense this time,” said Turnbull. “This election is really about a fractured polity – and probably, a fractured parliament.”Trudeau will be looking to protect his position in Ontario and Quebec, which command a majority of parliament’s 338 seats.Scheer’s ability to make inroads in the suburbs outside Toronto could be decisive.Among the inidual races, many eyes will be on Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, two former Liberal rising stars who were ejected from the party in the fallout of the SNC Lavalin scandal. The pair are both hoping to retain their seats as independents.With a hung parliament the most likely outcome, Canada’s extensive – but unwritten – rules surrounding the Westminster system will come into play.Scheer, who has rejected working with other parties in a minority government scenario, has staked out the position that the party with the most seats should be given the first chance at forming a government.“It is clear that in modern Canadian history, the party with the most seats forms the government, and that a prime minister who comes out of an election with fewer seats than another party, resigns,” he said. “That is the convention.”Experts disagree, citing extensive precedent in which the governing party did not command the plurality of seats.“There is no truth to this suggestion by Andrew Scheer that there’s a modern convention around the prime minister resigning if he doesn’t come first,” said Turnbull. “The prime minister is the prime minister until he resigns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7911dbac67bdf047bfd790ce5ca64774dd8eac19/0_71_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ff94d937b782aeaa01f0f1d00cbabdb","title":"monday briefing labours 11th hour bid to scupper brexit deal","story":"Party courts rebel Tories and DUP to force softer Brexit … Hillary Clinton trolls Donald Trump … and Lenny Henry’s emotional memoirGood morning and welcome to this Monday briefing with Alison Rourke.After a weekend that promised more Brexit action than it delivered, many in Westminster and beyond will be hoping that the coming days provide more clarity. Today the PM is expected to try to win parliamentary backing for his deal in a straight yes or no vote in the Commons, in the hope that MPs will sign off on the withdrawal agreement before there is the chance to scrutinise the full legislation and attach amendments. But Labour has another plan: overnight it declared that it would seek the backing of rebel Tories and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to drop the deal – or accept a softer Brexit. Some of what happens today will hinge on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, will allow another “meaningful vote”, because Johnson tried and failed to get it done on Saturday. No 10 will resist any amendments to the Brexit legislation, arguing that the current offer from the EU is the only one on the table and that “wrecking amendments” could torpedo the fragile coalition that it is trying to assemble for a deal.Our guide to what next for Brexit sets out the potential paths ahead. The PM claims he has the numbers to get his way, including all of his 287 voting MPs (including his brother Jo), about 20 former Tories who left the party or had the whip suspended, and about eight Labour MPs. You can read the papers’ opposing stances on Brexit here, but it’s a brave person who would predict with any certainty exactly what may happen over the next few days.Air pollution – Scores of people are being rushed to hospital for emergency treatment on days of high pollution in cities across England, including for heart attacks and strokes. Data from the King’s College London study, to be published in full next month, shows the extra strain on the NHS on those days, including 120 more cardiac arrests, 230 more strokes and 200 more people needing asthma treatment. “It’s clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency,” said the NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens. Previous studies have found spikes in hospital admissions and GP visits on days of high pollution, but the new data gives precise numbers for nine English cities and shows a clear relationship between heart attacks, strokes and respiratory illnesses and dirty air.Christmas recycling – John Lewis and Waitrose are to stop selling crackers containing plastic toys and puzzles as part of a drive to reduce single-use plastics – but not until 2020. Today they will announce a switch to recyclable materials such as metal and paper. John Lewis has also joined the wider crackdown on glitter (some of which contain microplastics) by reducing the amount used to decorate its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags and tags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds.Northern Ireland abortion rights protest –Members of mothballed Stormont assembly are due to return to the chamber today for the first time in almost three years to protest against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland. The DUP and other anti-abortion members will stage what is expected to be a largely symbolic recall of the assembly. The region’s near-blanket ban on abortion is due to end at midnight tonight after a historic vote in the House of Commons last July to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.‘Don’t be a dick’ – Hillary Clinton has been trolling Donald Trump, tweeting a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev, which was intended to ridicule a real letter from Trump to the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, revealed publicly last week. “Found in the archives,” Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. “Dear Premier Khrushchev,” the “letter” began, “Don’t be a dick, OK? Get your missiles out of Cuba … if you don’t everyone will be like ‘what an asshole’ and call your garbage country ‘The Soviet Bunion’”. Trump’s letter to Erdoğan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria “Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!”, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone.Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America.

But his new autobiography, Who am I, Again? is also about bearing witness to the time of his early years in Dudley. “I grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan ‘If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour’,” he tells Lanre Bakare, referring to Peter Griffiths’s notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives.The book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984. To write it, Henry opened up a “pandora’s box” of memories and then started, as he puts it, “to vomit out the chapters”. He turned violence at home into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy his mother (who died in 1998) a home. He used his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies and honed his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men’s clubs. At 61, and arguably Britain’s best known comic, Henry continues to push back against racism: “When, in 100 years’ time, we look back at the way things change, we’ll go: ‘Wow, that was a snap of a finger.’ But when you’re in the middle of it, change is long. And I think that’s the problem. Things aren’t happening fast enough.”The former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has warned the world economy is sleeping walking into a new financial crisis that will have devastating consequences for the democratic market system. Lord King, who was in charge at Threadneedle Street during the near-death of the global banking system and deep economic slump a decade ago, said the resistance to new thinking meant a repeat of the chaos of the 2008-09 period was looming. Giving a lecture in Washington at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, King said there had been no fundamental questioning of the ideas that led to the crisis of a decade ago. “Another economic and financial crisis would be devastating to the legitimacy of a democratic market system,” he said. “By sticking to the new orthodoxy of monetary policy and pretending that we have made the banking system safe, we are sleepwalking towards that crisis.”Continuing uncertainty over Brexit has pushed the pound down from a five-month high against the dollar and the euro. It’s buying $1.291 and €1.157.The papers almost all focus on the prospect of a new vote on the prime minister’s Brexit deal today. The FT reports that things are looking fairly sunny for the prime minister: “Johnson sticks to Brexit deal as faith rises in Westminster victory”. The  reports: “Labour seeks new alliance to kill off PM’s Brexit deal”, the i has: “Labour to back deal ... if second referendum included”.Other papers are livid at Labour’s talk of amendments, like the Daily Mail, which reports on “Fury at Labour plot to wreck Brexit”. The Express channels some of this fury: “How dare they! New plot to hijack Brexit”. The Times reports: “Downing St says Labour is trying to stop Brexit”, and the  says “PM faces ‘guerrilla war’ over new vote on deal”.The Sun’s lead story is “Bad blood brothers”, about comments made by Prince Harry that he and his brother are “on different paths” and the Mirror leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon’s biggest UK warehouse: “Treated like slaves”.

This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.”Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe organisation estimates that almost 21 million young people have been impacted by its ongoing programme of mentoring across the world.The Duchess of Sussex, the singer Ellie Goulding, the supermodel Leomie Anderson and Edward Enninful, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, will also attend the annual four-day summit, which will be London’s largest and most international event since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, Tidjane Thiam from Credit Suisse and Feike Sijbesma from DSM.They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them:Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old. The organisation is now one of the world’s largest youth-run environmental non-profits. It has projects in 62 countries and has mobilised more than 7,000 young people, all under 24, to build tangible solutions for communities facing acute climate crisis.Now 23, Datt has created a number of technology and data projects to address specific problems, including low-cost water filtration units, providing safe water to more than 40,000 people in rural Tanzania, recycling 3,000,000+ litres of swimming pool water annually in Haryana in India and planting more than 1,500,000 trees in Gambia and 600,000 in India.As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heatingcooling systems during peak demand times.I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn’t not do.One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn’t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems.Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser.It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it’s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change.Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me.Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn’t care: I knew what I was doing was right.Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks.I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste.When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community’s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems.I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late.I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I’d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa.I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production.Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines.When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station’s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them – from global heating and deforestation to pollution – and how they could help.Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities.I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work.Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn’t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government. People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business.But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me.Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16.I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet.I realised as I got older that that’s wrong. I realised that I couldn’t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos.Young people have so much power because we’re so angry. We’re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters. There’s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we’re really clear: we don’t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We’re very clear that it’s your mess and you must clear it up.Winner of the 2016 International Children’s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children’s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old.When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it.Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We’re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Photograph: Alan BetsonRegular readers will know that Eir has featured on this page quite a bit over the last year and although the company has promised a dramatic overhaul of its customer service department, the complaints are still coming in and we have two this week. “I am really sorry that I am asking of your time to help me with this,” starts a mail from a reader called Fidelma.“I wish I could take care of the matter myself but I am at my wits’ end. I recently moved home to take care of my mum (widow), who shattered her pelvis in a fall. I am a single mum of three and having broadband is a luxury item for us,” she continues.“At my previous address we had Sky and there was never an issue. When I moved, Sky couldn’t provide a service due to the rural setting. I contacted Eir on July 19th and spoke to a rep who assured me once I gave my bank details that no money would be taken out of my account until they could assure me of a service.”On that call Fidelma was told to wait until she received a text from the company and when she did she was told she would then have to follow up with a call five working days later. “Needless to say I received no text or anything further. On August 11th €59.15 was removed from my account. On the 12th and 15th of August I spent two solid days on the phone to Eir and also emailing them contacting them on Facebook Messenger and web chat.”She says she dealt with “many rude reps and two nice ones”.Each time she spoke to Eir she was assured that “I had no account and everything was cancelled and I would be issued a refund in 60 days.” That did not happen.“I have now received another email from them with a new invoice. As it is the weekend the customer care is not open. Due to previous interactions after relaying my situations multiple times on the web chat and Facebook Messenger, I have been told my issue can be only dealt with over the phone.”She says the customer care line is open between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Friday when she is at work and she says she would expect to be “held in a queue for over an hour”.She says she really believed that after spending “two whole days” previously on the phone “that last time that it would sort it. The stress this is causing me is unfair and unnecessary. I am trying to work, take care of my mother and my daughters and cannot see how I can resolve this. If I cancel the direct debit (which I never authorised to be used as such) will they hand it over to a debt collector? All for a service I never received. I am still without broadband as I am terrified that I cannot escape Eir.”She says reps have hung up the phone on her and another asked her: “What do you want me to do about it?” She says she has been promised that people would return her calls but “nothing and no help has come”.Her mail concludes with a plaintive “Please, please help – it may not seem like much money but to me it is a lot and I am worried it will continue. I don’t know what else to do and the stress and the lack of any progress is like a nightmare.”Phone cut offAnd then there was this one.“One year ago in June 2018 Eir cut off my contract phone and I lost my number,” writes Maxine. The company was supposed to cancel her broadband and her TV but she wanted to keep her mobile phone. Instead “everything was cancelled”.She says this caused her a lot of distress as she was moving country and while she was going to be overseas – in Lebanon – she needed an Irish phone as she has a serious medical condition which was being treated in Ireland.To replace her old number she got a pay-as-you-go phone also with Eir and passed the details to her medical team in Ireland.Maxine has a brain tumour “and had surgery before I left Ireland in June. My bloods were not correct this summer and I am awaiting a call from my team,” she writes.She lost her phone service at the end of September and has tried to resolve the issue using Eir’s web chat but every time she has tried it has been unsuccessful. “Even today my chat was dropped three times and have been told different stories as to why my service is not working.”She has been told there is not enough credit on her account . She says there is €20 on the account and she has been told her phone package does not allow to have the phone as it is set up.She says the problems have been compounded as she accesses her Irish bank accounts using her Irish mobile phone.On the day she wrote to us - last Monday - she said she had spent two hours on webchat with Eir and was then told she would have to wait another 48 hours to be contacted by technical support. “I was reduced to tears in front of my 11- and eight-year-old sons. I am really distressed over this and at my wits’ end. I really hope your influence will help.”We contacted the company and asked not only about these problems but about how improvements in its customer care offering were coming along.“A year ago we began the process to bring all customer care roles back in-house, a huge programme of work which included the building of a new centre in Sligo, on a green field site and the upgrading and expansion of two more new care centres in Cork and Limerick. Some 1,200 employees have been hired and trained across care, retail and sales. Those people are now established in their roles and some have been promoted to team lead and trainer positions in recent months,” a spokeswoman said. \u0026nbsp“We are proud of all that has been achieved so far but this programme is by no means complete. We will continue to invest to meet our goal of a best in class care service for our customers. We have seen huge improvements in the quality of care our customers are receiving, but of course not every interaction is perfect. We have reached out to the customers you have highlighted to us, to apologise that they did not receive the standard of care they should expect. We have resolved those issues and will continue to work to ensure the betterment of our care service.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShopping online from ChinaNext up there is a reader called Bryan who is dismayed at the quality of some clothes he bought from China and with the aftercare he received.Bryan says that when the clothes arrived “they were the wrong size, bad quality, had defects, did not match the description, etc”.So he immediately wrote to the company seeking a return address and a refund “which they have not given me. One item never arrived and they will not refund me for the item. Instead they are insisting they will resend the item which I have refused but to no avail.”Bryan wonders if he has any rights when it comes to getting his money back. “I am not entirely sure the company are Chinese as the website doesn’t say this, but the goods arrived from China. I had a look at their refund policy and it contained gems like ‘Note that we can accept goods only in case it is hanging by the wall.’”None of that sounds great. But it does serve as a timely reminder that when it comes to shopping online you need to have your wits about you.When you buy from a website based in the European Union you have many rights thanks to a consumer rights directive which came into force across in 2014.If you buy something online and it is faulty, you have exactly the same rights as if you bought it in a shop and you are entitled to a repair, a refund or a replacement. Under the directive, an online seller must give you specific information, including the price, any taxes that may apply, delivery costs and details of what to do if you change your mind. You also have a cooling-off period of at least 14 days, starting from the date you receive the order. Before the end of the 14 days, an order can be cancelled and the item returned.You also have extra rights if your goods are not delivered on time. Generally speaking, online retailers have 30 days to get your stuff to you unless you agree otherwise.However all of these rights apply only to transactions that happen within the EU. So if you buy clothes from Dave’s Dodgy Deals in Doha you can expect your rights to be significantly diminished.And that is what is happening here.More and more people are buying direct from Chinese sites, lured by the promise of dramatic discounts but – as in so many areas – if something seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true.When shopping in sites outside the EU – either those based in Beijing or (soon) Bristol, you will need to be wary of unexpected charges such as increased taxes and inflated delivery charges. There may also be safety concerns about some products as something sold from outside the EU does not have to meet certain standards.And when you buy from outside the EU you don’t automatically have rights enshrined in law to return an item even if it is faulty or not as described.Bryan has fought a good fight but he could still end up on the losing side. He can’t even arrange for a chargeback on the items which have already been delivered because his bank is unlikely to entertain him, although be might be able to convince his bank to give him money back for the items which never arrived.All of this is not to say that people should never buy from China or other countries that offer little by way of protection but it is always going to be a gamble, so you might be well advised to keep your spending under a certain limit and spend only as much as you are willing to lose should everything go pear-shaped.It is also worth bearing in mind when buying clothes that sizes in different parts of the world can vary and a large in one country can be a medium in another one. If you are buying from far-flung places, check the feedback and reviews of the seller and their products and if you can’t find contact details before you buy then maybe you shouldn’t be buying there at all, no matter how good the deal seems.Good-news storiesWe like to feature good-news stories on the page and would do so more frequently it we could. We got two in the space of two days last week that we are delighted to highlight.“I would like to commend the National Concert Hall for their resolution of an issue I had with a considerably out-of-date voucher,” starts a mail from a reader by the name of Richie Ryan.“Their IT system didn’t allow the voucher to be processed but the manager issued me two complimentary tickets for the concert I wished to attend,” he says. “I suspect the two tickets may have cost slightly more than my voucher. Either way I feel like a winner. That’s not something I often feel when using vouchers.”And then there is Brittany Ferries, which another reader, Eddie Duggan, says provided him and his family with some “outstanding service”.“My family of three travelled the RoscoffCork route on October 12th,” he writes. “Shortly before boarding, my daughter was taken severely ill. We informed the check-in staff and they provided a wheelchair to help her board, they upgraded us to a vastly superior cabin at no extra charge, and provided a crew member to take my daughter to her cabin.”He says the ferry company also provided him and his family with a disembarkation assistance.“We can only try to express our gratitude to the check-in staff and crew members for their assistance and for their cheerful , helpful and friendly manners. Can you please pass on our thanks to all your staff involved?”Yes. Yes, we can."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057237.1571605210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wealthy students more likely to study high points courses report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of the UCD campus at Belfield, Dublin. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Affluent students are far more likely to study high-points courses in university and earn more within months of graduating than those from less well-off backgrounds, a new study finds.Medicine, dentistry, finance and engineering courses attract the highest proportions of well-off students from the wealthiest parts of the country, according to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) research. By contrast, agricultural, environmental, social work and childcare programmes have the highest proportions of students from poorer backgrounds.Not surprisingly, affluent students are more likely to earn significantly more within months of graduating from college. But even where students study the same course in the same institution, an average affluent student stands to earn 30 per cent more than an average disadvantaged student.Trinity College Dublin was not included in the data due to data protection concerns, which have since been resolved. Letterkenny Institute of Technology had the highest proportion of disadvantaged students (24 per cent), followed by IT Sligo and IT Tralee.Overall, the proportion of affluent students is much higher in the university sector. Institutes of technology, on the other hand, are more likely to reflect the social profile of the national population.A breakdown of students’ CAO points scores also shows the extent to which high points are strongly associated with affluent backgrounds.For example, among students scoring 405 to 600 Leaving Cert points, more than one-quarter – 27 per cent – were from affluent backgrounds, compared with just 3 per cent from disadvantaged areas.This pattern was the reverse for students scoring below 200 points. A total of 24 per cent in this category were from disadvantaged backgrounds and 8 per cent were from affluent areas.Medicine coursesOf all college courses, the class gap in medicine is most stark. For example, while about 15 per cent of the wider population are defined as affluent, more than 36 per cent of enrolments in medicine courses are people from affluent backgrounds.Similarly, while 15 per cent of secondary students nationally are defined as disadvantaged, just 3.5 per cent of medicine enrolments are students from such backgrounds.While medicine offers one of the highest-earning career opportunities, medical students are among the most subsidised students in the country by the taxpayer.The findings are contained in a new study by the HEA which shows the most detailed picture yet of the socio-economic profile of college students.The data, compiled from students’ addresses, is based on enrolments during the 201718 academic year.Caitríona Ryan, the HEA’s head of access policy, said the study’s findings will support institutions to develop more targeted approaches to widening access in their regions. “We know that our higher education institutions are committed to increasing equity of access to higher education and have made significant progress over time,” she said. The Irish Universities Association said its members have been proactive in encouraging and supporting students from less well-off backgrounds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057234.1571604734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one third of older irish adults say they feel lonely some of the time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Loneliness is a growing public health concern as there is clear evidence that feeling lonely is damaging to the health and wellbeing of older adults.” Photograph: Getty Images  One-third of older Irish adults say they feel lonely some of the time, according to a new report, which found “worrying” levels of isolation among over-50s.Loneliness is most prevalent among over-75s and those living alone, the study by researchers in Trinity College Dublin found. It was also found to be damaging to the health and wellbeing of older adults, the loneliest of whom had poorer quality of life and health.Depression is found in tandem with loneliness, with more than three-quarters of the most lonely group reporting depressive symptoms compared to just 7.4 per cent of the least lonely group.The research is part of the ongoing Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing of adults aged 50 and older in Ireland. This analysis is based on responses from up to 8,000 participants.Almost 10 per cent of older adults are socially isolated, meaning they have one or no regular social contacts, but isolation is more prevalent in Dublin than in rural areas. Some 7 per cent says they often feel lonely.However, objectively measured social isolation and subjective loneliness do not always overlap one in five of those with high levels of social contact still reported feeling lonely.The study suggests a link between loneliness and education levels, with those who left school after primary level almost twice as likely to be “most isolated” with few social contacts compared to those who attended third level. Health concernDr Mark Ward, the lead author of the study, said it provided clear evidence of the need to address loneliness among the older population. “Loneliness is a growing public health concern as there is clear evidence that feeling lonely is damaging to the health and wellbeing of older adults. “This report highlights the fact that certain groups of older adults are particularly vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation. In particular, older adults who live alone are more socially isolated and report greater feelings of loneliness.”Loneliness and social isolation are not a necessary fact of the ageing process, the authors emphasise, so efforts to alleviate these “potentially damaging” phenomena should be encouraged.“There is a need to address both the subjective and objective features of loneliness in order to positively impact the wellbeing of older adults.” The report is due to be launched by Minister of State for mental health and older people Jim Daly, who last May announced a €3 million mental health fund to help community organisations combat isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Diarmuid Martin says \u0026lsquonegativity and polarisation\u0026rsquo not way to defend Church teachingMeeting held over proposal to accommodate up to 130 people in Co Leitrim townTD says Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader accepts her explanation for casting on behalf of colleagueMan (30s) is 118th person killed on the State\u0026rsquos roads this yearSpecial sitting of Assembly to stop decriminalisation dismissed as a \u0026lsquostunt\u0026rsquoRoad safety group concerned over low rate of enforcement in some rural Garda isionsDeath of man in his late 30s arose from drug overdose, garda\u0026iacute believeNew research shows affluent students are far more likely to study such programmesIncrease in the secret service vote to be used to fund sensitive operations amid UK\u0026rsquos exitNew laws in North will see further isions emerge as attitudes harden within churchIn Kilkeel, Co Down, fishermen blame the EU for the industry\u0026rsquos decline, but not all agreeData released to The  amid increasing calls for hate crime legislationTenders to redevelop Victorian fruit and vegetable market expected to be sought next monthBusiness backers row in behind \u0026lsquovery skilled\u0026rsquo Irish driver in pole position to make the gradeReport finds loneliness is damaging to health and wellbeing of older adults, the loneliest of whom had poorer quality of life and healthSilica dust, which occurs when cutting concrete, has been proven to be carcinogenicLocals to stage protest outside apartment block expected to be used as accommodation"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056983.1571585757!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain ruled the waves it was took off us by the eu the dogs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeslie Garvan  on board one of his two fishing boats in  Kilkeel harbor in Northern Ireland. Photograph: James Forde for The Leslie Garvan, a trawler owner from Kilkeel in Co Down who has done well out of fishing, wants to take back what he views as rightfully British.Garvan is a now successful, Jaguar-driving businessman. He owns two trawlers, as well as a fuel-oil business which supplies the fleet at Kilkeel, one of the North’s main fishing ports, and a brokerage that buys and sells catches.Following Thursday’s Brussels deal, senior Northern Irish fishing figures are bullish. The industry does not need to negotiate, says Harry Wick, the chief executive of the NI Fish Producers’ Organisation.It will be for the EU to make concessions to negotiate access to UK waters.“We hold the cards,” he says. “We can afford to say we don’t want any EU access into our waters.”Brexit, however, is likely to shred the decades-old rulebook for an industry deeply embedded on both sides of the Border – an industry that has always had an influence that outweighs its economic importance.SovereigntyFishing contributes about the same to the UK economy as lock and hinge makers, or ride-on lawnmowers. Yet, it stays centre stage because it is often a proxy for sovereignty concerns.“It’s so emotive. We are an island nation . . . it’s something that helped to galvanise and inspire Brexiteers,” says Chris Williams, a marine socioeconomics expert with the New Economics Foundation.Fishing once offered settled futures for places such as Kilkeel, including to people such as Alan McCulla, who now runs the Anglo North Irish Fish Producers’ Organisation (Anifpo).Locally influential, McCulla, a onetime aide to DUP MEP Diane Dodds, is an ardent Brexiteer. Sitting alongside Garvan in the Anifpo building on the Kilkeel quays, the pair argue that EU fishing rules have been built on deceit.After accession, times were good. A ban on North Sea herring fishing drove a boom in the Irish Sea, and Kilkeel boomed louder than most. EU and government grants paid for two-thirds of the cost of a new trawler.Kilkeel’s fleet grew from 40 boats to more than 160, with locals today remembering being able to walk from boat to boat across the width of the harbour. Now, McCulla sees the EU grants as a “bribe . . . to make everyone believe that the European machinery is so terrific.”In the last 30 years, fishermen’s quotas have been savaged. Life after Brexit will be better, both argue.“We can’t come out of it, frankly, worse. We’ve got to come out of it better,” says Garvan.Millennium bugIn the Neptune Cafe on the seaside, former fisherman Jim Hill agrees. He cites the trope that Brexit is like the millennium bug – a contrived panic.“Get on with it, get it over with,” he says.Some, however, are more cautious.“I deliver to the South nearly every day. If there’s border checks or anything like that, that’s going to add two or three hours on each way,” says Jamie Gibbons, who drives a SeaSource delivery van.Below decks on the trawler Renown, skipper Lawrence Warnock is busy mending nets. The nets are strictly measured, thanks to EU regulations, to help small fish escape. If he is boarded and found with the wrong nets he could face heavy fines, or lose his licence. Initially, the regulations frustrated him, but now he sees their worth reflected in healthier fish stocks.When not looking for fish, Warnock is in search of workers, and they are increasingly hard to find. In 2016, fishing was one of the lowest-paid professions, with average earnings of just £19,004 per year.Four Ghanaian migrants work with Warnock and his father, Philip.“If you bring in the likes of a local man, he doesn’t want to do the work,” explains Warnock. “They just get on with their work and they don’t complain.”Not all of fishing’s problems can be laid at the door of the EU, argues Chris Williams. During the original carve-up of fishing rights in the 1970s, the UK was outmanoeuvred by the French, Belgians and Dutch.“If your negotiator comes back with a bad deal, do you blame the people he was negotiating with?” he asks.Big operatorsMeanwhile, UK quotas are largely given to the big operators. Nearly everything goes to corporate-owned offshore fleets with large trawlers. But three-quarters of the UK fleet is small, inshore boats, left to scramble for just 2 per cent of the quota.“Telling people it’s because of the EU is untrue,” according to Williams. “There’s a convenient bogeyman which means the government doesn’t have to take responsibility for its own decisions.”Meanwhile, nothing has been spent on NI’s fishing towns for decades, argues economist Paul Mac Flynn of the left-leaning Nevin Economic Research Institute (NERI).“The EU alone is not the cause of hardship in fishing communities,” he says, “The grievance for fishing communities is what was lost, and what never came to replace it. But the EU is the wrong target.”Both McCulla and Garvan agree that a no-deal Brexit – if that were to happen – would create difficulties, but solutions can be found.“If there’s a pound to be made on both sides, business will find a way to make that pound,” says Garvan.TariffsReality, again, may be more complex. More than a third of the Northern Irish catch goes to EU markets – though Norwegian fish faces 70 per cent tariffs to get to the shops.Pain, argues Mac Flynn, is impossible to avoid. High tariffs would not change export trade flows – it would eliminate them.“It’s not like the UK is suddenly going to start consuming more fish,” he says.Voters have been told, Williams says, that things will be “perfect the next day” after Brexit, ignoring the fact that years of negotiations lie ahead, with “few immediate benefits out of it”.Pro-Brexit voices argue that global sales will replace EU losses, even though access to such markets is currently ruled by EU trade deals, and the UK will take years to negotiate something to replace them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057226.1571602608!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il s lisa chambers voted for dara calleary after sitting in wrong seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers TD said she sat in the wrong seat in the Dáil.

I sat in Dara Calleary’s seat, which is beside my seat. I pressed the button once in error on the first vote, no one asked me to do this and when I realised, I immediately moved to my own seat. The vote was lost by a large number so I did not inform the Teller. It was a genuine mistake and not intended. I have informed the Ceann Comhairle this evening of my error.“I genuinely believed that this error was insignificant and when asked on RTÉ today had I ever voted for anyone else I answered no, as was never asked to vote for anyone else. For this I apologise.”Mr Calleary said: “After participating in a live Radio Interview I returned to Dáil chamber at about 2.10pm on Thursday and voted in the remaining votes.“I understand that Deputy Chambers inadvertently voted in my seat for the first of those votes but not for any of the remaining ones for which I was absent. She mistakenly did not correct the record on the day hence my name is registered.

Ms Chambers said she mistakenly sat in her colleague and party deputy leader Dara Calleary’s seat last Thursday for one vote and moved to her own seat for the same vote as soon as she realised.“I honest to God believed I was in my seat, and I was pressing my voting button,” she said.Ms Chambers admitted she “should have told the teller that there was an error recorded in the seat beside me”, adding: “I didn’t do that.”“The reason I didn’t is because the vote was lost by such a huge number that I genuinely thought it was insignificant and it was a genuine mistake,” she said.Ms Chambers said she told Mr Calleary about the mistake “on the day”.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK parliamentAFP via Getty ImagesBoris Johnson will try to push his Brexit deal through parliament in just over a week, despite sending a letter to the European Union requesting a three-month extension to Britain’s membership.His government will today attempt to put the deal to a “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons but Speaker John Bercow is expected to rule the move out of order.The prime minister will on Tuesday introduce the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill (WAB), the legislation required to implement the deal.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the government believed it could win a majority for the deal, either in a meaningful vote or when the Bill is put to its second reading on Tuesday.“We appear to have the numbers to get it through,” he told the BBC.Q\u0026ampA What happens next?When will agreement be debated? House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government planned to put exit deal to vote today, but House speaker John Bercow is yet to rule if that is allowed and will report to the house today.How long will Brexit legislation take to pass? The first main stage of debate is expected on Tuesday. Senior minister Michael Gove said government will push to get deal through parliament by October 31st. MPs will have opportunity to bring changes to legislation.Has the EU accepted request to delay Brexit? EU leaders are unlikely to deny request but diplomats have said bloc would not rush to decide on request.LettersMr Johnson sent a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk on Saturday requesting an extension under article 50 until January 31st. He was legally obliged to do so under the so-called Benn Act after MPs voted earlier that day by 322 to 306 for an amendment deferring approval of the deal until after its implementation legislation is passed.The prime minister accompanied the letter required by the Benn Act with another saying he opposed any further delay to Brexit.“While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming prime minister, and made clear to parliament again today, my view, and the government’s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,” he said.Mr Tusk said he would consult with EU capitals but no response to the extension request is likely until later this week.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would back an amendment to the WAB that would put Mr Johnson’s deal to a confirmatory referendum with an option to remain in the EU. The DUP, which voted for Saturday’s amendment in defiance of the government, said it was not seeking a second referendum but would exploit other opportunities to address its concerns about the deal.‘Relatively low’ riskTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said he believed it was “more likely than unlikely” that the House of Commons would pass a Brexit deal and that the risk of a no-deal Brexit now was “relatively low”.Speaking in Dublin yesterday, Mr Varadkar said EU member states were “reasonably asking” what the purpose of another extension would be.“Obviously the Government is disappointed that there wasn’t a vote in the House of Commons on the Brexit deal at the weekend,” he told RTÉ.“The UK has now requested an extension and of course, an extension would be preferable to no-deal if it comes to it. However, to grant an extension we need unanimity of the 27 member states. And member states are reasonably asking: what is the purpose of this extension? Is it more time to ratify the deal, or is it for something else? And I think some clarity from Westminster on that would be very helpful.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling initially slid 0.4 per cent against the dollar before recovering to rise above $1.30\u0026nbspin a volatile session after MPs backed an amendment to delay approving the Brexit deal.UK property asking prices registered their worst October since 2008, according to new figures from Rightmove, in the latest signal that the property market is slowing down.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load...Pound on the up, reversing this morning\u0027s fallsSeaside towns dominate list of insolvency hotspotsSmall firms suffering \u0027unprecedented slump in confidence\u0027Seaside towns and cities dominate a list of areas with the highest number of people declared insolvent, figures show.\u0026nbspUHY Hacker Young said a rise in staycations at seaside resorts resulting from the falling value of the pound had done little to make up for the longer-term decline of ship-building, fishing and other traditional coastal industries.\u0026nbspScarborough, Torbay, Plymouth, Hull and Blackpool all made the top 10\u0026nbspbut a non-seaside city, Stoke, topped the ranking, with 51 personal insolvencies per 10,000 adults.\u0026nbspPeter Kubik, Partner at UHY Hacker Young, said:\u0026nbsp“People living in seaside towns continue to fall into bankruptcy as the coastal economy fails to keep up with the rest of the country.”\u0026nbsp“Coastal towns such as Blackpool are clearly struggling to reinvent themselves and throw off their old image. Further investment is going to be needed to help these towns unlock their potenti\u0026nbspSmall firms suffering \u0027unprecedented slump in confidence\u0027\u0026nbsp(Press Association) The Government is being urged to tackle an unprecedented slump in confidence among small businesses amid warnings that thousands are struggling to stay afloat.\u0026nbspThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said Chancellor Sajid Javid should bring forward radical interventions in next month\u0027s Budget toaddress slowing economic growth.\u0026nbspThe group called for a major reduction in business rates bills for small firms, saying thousands were being hit by spiralling operating costs.\u0026nbspThe FSB recommended that the Retail Discount - which allows small retailers with rateable values of up to £51,000 to claim a 33 per cent\u0026nbspdiscount on their rates bills - be increased to at least 50 per cent, made permanent and extended to small firms operating in other sectors, including manufacturing.UK property market misses out on \u0027Autumn bounce\u0027\u0026nbspProperty prices typically get a boost in October but this has been dampened by Brexit this year, according to Rightmove.\u0026nbspIt found asking prices\u0026nbsprose 0.6 per cent to £306,712 compared to the same time last year, the worst rise for this time of year since 2008.\u0026nbspMiles Shipside, Rightmove director and housing market analyst, comments: “In a strange Brexit-induced paradox, thousands of potential sellers are holding back compared to this time a year ago, though the number of buyers agreeing purchases is virtually the same. \u0026nbspIronically, this means that those who are coming to market have a better chance of selling, so while some would-be sellers are being put off, it’s actually a good time to sell. Those who are ignoring the Brexit disruption have less competition from stay-away sellers, and their prospective buyers have less negotiating power, with a reduced choice of suitable alternatives.”Welcome to The Independent\u0027s rolling coverage of business and economics news.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe pound has had a jumpy morning following a dramatic weekend in the House of Commons. Sterling is down 0.3 per cent against the dollar at $1.293.\u0026nbspA report from the International Energy Agency out today predicts global renewable power capacity will rise 50 per cent in five years, mainly thanks to more solar panels on buildings - but it still won\u0027t be enough to meet climate change targets.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As he cruised along at 30,000 feet, an immense thought pressed in: I am about to save a boy’s life.His name was Flavio da Silva, and he lived in a favela called Catacumba on the steep hillsides of Rio. Days earlier, the boy had written: “This is a dream, and I shall end by awakening.”\u0026nbspBut it wasn’t. It wasn’t a dream. It was his life.Though neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in the United States, the other in Brazil. Both publications were trying to influence public opinion at a time when the ideological and geopolitical stakes felt frighteningly high.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Life’s circulation at the time was around 7 million copies, the highest in the land, and its Republican-leaning editors weren’t shy about using that influence.\u0026nbspIt was the height of the Cold War. Fidel Castro’s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to a communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled “Crisis in Latin America”. Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to the second part.Brazil, like the US, had a new president, Jânio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity programme, of which the US approved. But when the United States offered $300m\u0026nbsp(£234m) in foreign aid in return for cooperating with US\u0026nbspopposition to Castro’s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil’s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.Life editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, “find an impoverished father with a family of eight to 10 children. Show how he earns a living. Explore his political leanings. Is he a communist, or about to become one?”They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.Parks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying: “Rio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?”The first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by José Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc, Life’s owner. As they climbed up a “tangled maze of shacks”, Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head and who – he would soon discover – suffered from severe asthma.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.”Parks had his subject. He met Flavio’s seven siblings in their home, high up the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio’s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, José Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\u0026nbspMunizThe J Paul Getty Museum)Parks had travelled widely – including an earlier trip to Rio – but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. “You can photograph us,” José replied, eventually, “but you must show us in a good light.”“Just doing my job,” we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it feels suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\u0026nbspThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\u0026nbspParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio and on Flavio’s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in the rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\u0026nbspEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana’s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn’t help but empathise with Flavio. He wrote of being “filled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die\u0026nbsp... I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others”.But it wasn’t a lie.\u0026nbspPark’s photos appeared in the 16 June 1961, issue of Life under the heading, “Freedom’s Fearful Foe: Poverty.” You can see them in the first room of “Gordon Parks: The Flavio Story”, a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\u0026nbspParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said he wanted his work “to draw people’s attention to the problems they show” and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president’s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the United States lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realised, the United States needed first to “clean up its own yard”.Intimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks’s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. “Far from condescending, they utterly personalised ... and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,” Paul Roth wrote in the show’s terrific catalogue. (Roth’s essay is the source of much of the information in this story). They “punctured”, he said, Life magazine’s “conception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe” – communism.\u0026nbspParks’s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline “A Great Urge to Help Flavio”, it included an appeal for more donations, which Life said it would use to move the Da\u0026nbspSilvas\u0026nbspto a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\u0026nbspParks flew back to Rio on 28 June to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio’s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. “Keep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,” his father said.\u0026nbspAt Parks’s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (“The water was black,” Parks noted) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.The day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying: “What about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!”\u0026nbspThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport,\u0026nbspand all three flew to the United States.In Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children’s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 – designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself – were published in the magazine’s 21 July issue.\u0026nbspThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks’s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language version of Life, distributed throughout South America).\u0026nbspO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation US\u0026nbspmagazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\u0026nbspTheir response was impudent, blunt and charged with chutzpah. They sent a photographer of their own, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\u0026nbspBallot’s photographs were published in the 7 October 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot’s New York images with insets showing Park’s original Rio images.\u0026nbspThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging its photographs – of, effectively, manufacturing “fake news”. And, as happens routinely in any polarised media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.The ultimate guide to Rio de JaneiroHighway 61: Jessica Lange’s photography explores her midwestern rootsMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behaviour and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gonçalves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\u0026nbspHe begged Parks and the Gonçalves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in São Paulo. The schooling was arranged and paid for by Life.\u0026nbspParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy’s return to Brazil, and in 1978, he published a book (Flavio) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (Gordon Parks – Half Past Autumn). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject’s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\u0026nbsp“As a photojournalist,” Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, “I have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.”Flavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, “people know more about my life than I do. I’m glad that I’m alive as a result ... (But) this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The prototypes we developed propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.”While the concept of artificial skin has been explored in the field of robotics as scientists attempt to develop robots that look and act like humans, the researchers said they were more interested in working with everyday devices.Dr Roudaut added: “We have seen many works trying to augment humans with parts of machines, here we look at the other way around and try to make the devices we use every day more like us, ie, human-like.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I always thought my first time in London would be for sightseeing. Not because the country was in existential crisis.”The march route, for what it’s worth, took in Trafalgar Square, Marble Arch and the Houses of Parliament. “So I suppose I did get to see a few sights,” she added. “Two birds, one stone, and all that.”Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters

during the Final Say March in LondonAn anti-Brexit protester holds a sign calling for a Final Say during a march in LondonAs MPs sat in the Commons for the\u0026nbspfirst time on a Saturday since 1982, this vast rally outside was the physical embodiment of what campaigners say is the ever-growing support – and necessity – for a Final Say People’s Vote to resolve Brexit once and for all.Supporters came – young and old, Labour and Tory, by train and by coach – from the four corners of the UK to listen to speakers, including Sadiq Khan, Jo Swinson and Star Trek legend Patrick Stewart, make the case for another referendum. They came wearing blue and yellow, and waving EU flags. One arrived, uniquely perhaps, with a saucepan lid and wooden spoon.Double humiliation for Johnson over BrexitLive: PM to seek extension as Letwin amendment delays Brexit voteSenior figures break with Corbyn to declare Labour a Remain partyHundreds of thousands protest at Westminster to demand Final Say voteDiane Abbott and Jacob Rees-Mogg among MPs abused after Brexit voteBercow ready to sign extension letter to Brussels if asked“For making a noise,” explained 70-year-old Marian Hemsted, from Sevenoaks in Kent, banging them together by way of demonstration. “We want them to hear us in parliament and get the message. I’m not sure I have a strong enough voice to cheer everything I agree with today but I can hit a saucepan lid with the best of them.”She had come with daughter Rebecca and nine-month-old grandson Nathan. “I’m not sure he has an opinion on Brexit quite yet,” she admitted of the tot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThere was perhaps not quite the carnival atmosphere of previous rallies.There were drumming bands, painted faces and a bloke dishing out free vegetarian curries on route (it was nice). There was one woman, Tanya Hall, dressed as an EU fairy: “I made my wings using old coat hangers, tights and blue car spray from the back of the garage,” the 51-year-old said. “It represents how wonderful the EU is.”But, with a referendum appearing to be somehow simultaneously both closer and further away than ever, there was also a sense of urgency, anger and purpose – among both the crowd and the speakers.“I’ve never seen a greater contrast between a political system that’s blocked and broken, versus the energy and clarity that comes from you all marching peacefully through the streets today,” Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent, said during his speech. “The importance of giving you – giving everyone – the Final Say has never been clearer.”ChristofilouThe Independent )Others, including Michael Heseltine and Diane Abbott, were cheered as they riffed on other familiar themes: that Britain would be poorer out the EU, that the original referendum was built on lies, that Boris Johnson couldn’t be trusted with a pair of scissors, let alone the well-being of an entire country.Sandi Toksvig compared him to a dodgy used car salesman who had sold the public a broken vehicle from – wait for it – the “Nigel garage”.If that joke got a cheer, it was nothing compared to the reaction when the big screens showed live footage of the Letwin amendment being passed in the House of Commons – essentially making a Brexit delay more likely. Rarely can a vote in parliament have been greeted with such a roar. It was not dissimilar, one imagines, to how a world cup winning England goal might be greeted.“The whole referendum was built on lies,” said 71-year-old Felicity Goodall, who had been walking with three generations of her family. “No one told us anything about the consequences of leaving the EU or the mess it would get us into for three years. We were hoodwinked then and we’re being left voiceless now – and that can’t be allowed to happen.”London Brexit march to be built on northern people powerIt would, as it happens, have been four generations of her family marching but her 97-year-old father, Stephen Goodall, who attended both previous London rallies – one last November and one in March – had come down with a cold on Friday.“He’s devastated he can’t be here again,” she said. “But he’s here in spirit. He is desperate to see the UK remain. He says the EU is the reason there has been 70 years of peace in Europe, and he should know. He fought in World War Two and was in the army for 30 years after.”As ever at these rallies there were plenty of placards. They ranged from the poetic (“Let’s stay with the stars”) to the risque: “No one consented to this BJ”, read one.Kate Chacksfield’s homemade effort declared her to be “middle aged and slightly miffed”.“It’s the first sign I’ve ever made,” the 52-year-old mother-of-three, of London, said. “But I think, increasingly, I’m more than miffed. I’m angry by it all. Being in the EU brings so many opportunities – economically and culturally – and we are throwing away those opportunities so our children can’t enjoy them.”She would not stop campaigning, she said, until the decision was reversed – nor was she alone in this.Asked what they would do if a deal was passed and the UK did, indeed, leave the EU, most were defiant.“I’d start campaigning to re-enter,” said Alan Wheeler, a 50-year-old trade association director from Maidstone. “I think all this energy and anger that you see today, it won’t just disappear. People won’t just accept it if we leave. They will campaign to become a member again. These rallies will continue now until, one way or another, Brexit is no more. It is too important to just let go.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Last month, it was 20 per cent, but experts fear\u0026nbspthe figure could be even higher this month.Seasonal workers have been put off by the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit referendum and have left for jobs in other EU countries such as Germany,\u0026nbspNetherlands\u0026nbspand Denmark, the union said.\u0026nbspOn the Brexit effect, Ms Capper said: “It has been about making people feel like they are not welcome here.“It has been about question marks in terms of future status:\u0026nbsp‘Can I come back next year? Will I need a passport? Can I continue to come on my work card? Will I get stopped at the border?’“Brexit has put a lot of question marks in the minds of EU nationals.

A lot of people say ‘Get this done and move on’,” he said.Rudd says most exiled Tories will back Johnson dealIf parliament cannot decide on Brexit, then the people mustMr Johnson’s unsigned letter – accompanied by a signed message advising against a “corrosive” delay – was described as a potential contempt of parliament by Labour’s John McDonnell and will be the subject of legal action in Scotland’s highest court on Monday.SNP\u0026nbspMP Joanna Cherry, who led the successful legal challenge to the PM’s unlawful suspension of parliament, branded his letters “pathetic” and confirmed she will pursue action in Edinburgh’s Court of Session.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The party is expected to focus on amendments to boost ties with the EU’s customs union and to prevent a no-deal cliff-edge at the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020.The Final Say movement is increasingly hopeful of winning a Commons vote, with one source saying that a ision on a referendum between Remain and Mr Johnson’s plan was now “on a knife-edge”, and one pitching Remain against no deal was comfortably winnable, in the event that the PM’s deal fails.“Of course we need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through, it should be subject to a referendum where that deal is put to the public and they’re asked, ‘do you want to leave on these terms, or would you rather remain in the EU’,” said Sir Keir.Asked about the crucial Labour whip, he added: “We’ve already voted, I think, three times as a party for a second referendum with a three-line whip behind it. That’s the clear policy.”\u0026nbspKeir Starmer, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry called for a Final Say vote at Saturday’s march (AFP)It “makes sense” that Labour would repeat the offer made to Theresa May when it said “we don’t think your deal is very good, but if it’s up against the safeguard of being able to remain, then we will allow it to proceed in that way”, he said.Former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a backer of a people’s vote, said\u0026nbspSir Keir’s\u0026nbspwords were “significant”.“It is clear now that the party as a whole and the shadow cabinet are firmly behind a referendum in a way that people weren’t sure of before,” she told The Independent. “There’s no doubt that quite a number of people who were very much opposed have come round to the idea.”Labour’s Peter Kyle said he would\u0026nbsptable an amendment for a confirmatory referendum “as soon as politically appropriate”, though timing was uncertain because of the unpredictability of the government’s plans.An “indicative vote” on a second referendum moved by Mr Kyle and fellow Labour MP Phil Wilson failed by just 12 votes earlier this year. But an amendment may struggle to improve on this result, as 45 Tories – including a number of government ministers – abstained in that ision but could be expected to oppose it this time around.Key to success would be winning over pro-deal Labour MPs and exiled Tories sitting as independents. Most of these are likely to be swayed only if Tuesday’s vote is close enough to suggest that Mr Johnson’s package needs a referendum attached to be sure of passing.ChristofilouThe Independent)And there are also tentative feelers being put out to the Democratic Unionist Party after its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds suggested it was looking at options to amend the PM’s deal, which they regard as unacceptable.The party’s Brexit spokesperson,\u0026nbspSammy Wilson, said the DUP was not seeking a second referendum.But Sir Keir said: “I would openly invite the DUP to talk to us, because anybody who wants to improve on the situation – and they do – should be working together.”A pro-referendum source said the DUP might be swayed by the thought that they are faced with a choice between a general election which they do not relish – if Mr Johnson seeks to capitalise on his deal going through – or a referendum.Sir Keir acknowledged that staging a fresh public vote would take as long as 22 weeks. But he said the PM was trying to hurry the process through in order to avoid having the flaws in his plan uncovered.“The more scrutiny there is of Boris Johnson’s deal, the more I think people are going to be persuaded that it’s a very bad deal,” he said. “And one of the reasons I think he’s trying to bounce us through this is because if you look at the detail it exposes his half-truths and untruths.”But a Downing Street source said: “We cannot allow parliament’s letter to lead to parliament’s delay – we must leave on 31 October and finally get Brexit done. The best way of doing this is for MPs to vote for Boris Johnson’s new deal.”It is expected that the debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill will involve long hours in the Commons and potential weekend sittings in the Lords.A government source said: “The public will expect us to move at pace to get the withdrawal agreement passed so we can leave on 31 October. There will be time for parliament to consider the legislation and any amendments.”Meanwhile, the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine urged voters to sign the Letter from the People to the Powerful to put maximum pressure on politicians to give the public a say.“One million supporters of the people’s vote marched outside parliament, while\u0026nbspinside\u0026nbspMPs from all parties stood firm against Boris Johnson’s efforts to force his hard and bitter Brexit on our country,” said Lord Heseltine.“From the Highlands, to Belfast, from Cardiff to Penzance, people came from across every corner of the land to make themselves heard.\u0026nbsp“We will march on. We’re sending a letter from the people to the powerful to demand they don’t turn their backs and instead give the people the final say. Sign the letter. Send the message.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His 2015 victory reasserted liberalism in Canada after almost 10 years of Conservative government and his presidency has been viewed as a beacon for liberals in the era of Donald Trump.However, political scandals involving attempted interference in the justice system and the resurfacing of old photos of Mr Trudeau in blackface and brownface have cast doubt on his judgement.In the interference scandal, Mr Trudeau’s former attorney general said he pressured her to halt the prosecution of a Quebec company, causing the Conservatives to call for the prime minister’s resignation.On Wednesday, Barack Obama made an intervention unprecedented\u0026nbspby a former US president when he urged Canadians to re-elect Mr Trudeau.“The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term,” Mr Obama wrote.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The finding provides strong evidence that the street was commissioned by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of the province of Judaea, best known for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion.After six years of extensive archaeological excavations, a team\u0026nbspfrom the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered a 220m section of\u0026nbspthe ancient street.The road ascends from the Pool of Siloam in the south to the Temple Mount.

From the mid-19th century, iron mining fundamentally altered Western Cumbria and the Furness peninsular, making a significant contribution to the national economy. However, site clearances following industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century, has left few surviving remains of the industry. Florence Mine is believed to have been the last iron mine to close in Europe and was last worked in 2007. Hematite iron ore from the mine is used for the pigment Egremont Red, still found in some lipsticks today.234 University of York, Campus West designed landscape. Heslington, YorkThe University of York Campus West designed landscape was laid out from 1963-1980 It is a high-quality post-war university landscape that fulfils the architects’ masterplan vision of creating a town in miniature with a pedestrianised environment. One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The thatched memorial bus shelter at Osmington in West Dorset is located on the south side of the A353 and is an important landmark in the village. It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

It dates to around 1907 and originates from a pub called The Cock which was located at a junction known as The Cock Cross Roads and owned by ‘Gentleman Jackson’ (1769-1845), a celebrated English boxer who won the title ‘Champion of England.’  The Cock Sign stands at a prominent location at the junction of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Castle Place, NottinghamAcclaimed sculptor and Nottingham native, James Arthur Woodford RA OBE was commissioned to craft this imaginative group of sculptures, depicting the legendary characters of Robin Hood and his Merry Men, to commemorate the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh for the city’s quincentenary celebrations in 1949. Woodford conceived the group of sculptures to occupy the land in the outer ditch of Nottingham Castle, the setting of one of the most popular legendary tales of Robin Hood. 3234 Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

One of the key features of the landscape is the lake, which has two small islands, a courtyard pool and a fountain which form a central focal point at the heart of the campus. Offering bursts of green against the surrounding concrete structures are the lake features, reed beds and lily pads, which were introduced to improve water purity. The landscape is relatively unaltered since it was laid out and the design successfully integrates the new landscape with the historic Heslington Hall gardens. It was designed by distinguished mid-20th century architects Andrew Derbyshire and Maurice Lee of RMJM with Frank Clark, the co-founders of the Garden History Society (now The Garden Trust).334 University of York, Campus West designed landscape.

It is here that they made 17 gallon galvanised iron containers, designed for transporting milk by rail. The company was heavily associated with George Barnham, who invented the containers and went on to become chair of the British Dairy Farmers Association, Mayor of Hampstead and High Sheriff of Middlesex and was knighted in 1904.Travellers on the East Coast Main Line north of York typically pass the former Otterington Railway Station at over 100 miles per hour. This station building with its signal box was built by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1932 as a replacement for the Victorian station that had been cleared away to allow the expansion of the line to four tracks. 634 University of York, Central Hall. Heslington, YorkThe University of York was one of seven new universities founded in England between 1958 and 1961. Central Hall is the centrepiece of the University’s western campus and has a striking and bold design. The exceptionally detailed development plan behind the campus was heralded as the beginning of contemporary university planning in Britain. The building is a concrete structure with a suspended mild steel tubular roof clad in aluminium, with the upper floors, where the auditorium is located, cantilevered out on the lake sides. It continues a historic tradition established by late 19th century and early 20th century ‘red brick’ universities in featuring a great hall for special events.734 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade. South LondonThe Crystal Palace subway, vestibule, terrace and stairs provide an elaborate pedestrian passageway, with finely-crafted Byzantine-style vaulting in red and cream brick and chequered floors in alternating stone. The structure dates from 1865 and was built to link a new train station directly to the entrance of the Crystal Palace. Designed by highly-accomplished architect Charles Barry Junior, the quality of construction is excellent. It is an architecturally imaginative solution to the problem of transporting visitors beneath Crystal Palace Parade and providing a dramatic introduction to the palace itself. 834 Pedestrian Subway, Vestibule, Terrace and Stairs beneath Crystal Palace Parade.

The thatched memorial bus shelter at Osmington in West Dorset is located on the south side of the A353 and is an important landmark in the village. It dates to around the 1940s and was built by Harry and Ethel Parry-Jones in memory of their son, David, a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Rifle Brigade who died at the age of 20 on 3 August 1944 during the Battle of Normandy. Local materials were used including Purbeck stone and thatch which complements the bus shelter’s surroundings. Despite its vulnerability as a piece of street furniture, the bus shelter has not been significantly altered since it was first built. It demonstrates that even modest and functional structures can form eloquent and valuable memorials for their local communities.Although modest in scale, the Assembly Rooms building has great presence with its bright, red brick exterior. This charming community hall boasts an exuberant design with its late-19th century, Jacobean Revival style, terracotta tiles and stone detailing.

Pendeen, CornwallThe parish of Pendeen in Cornwall was established in 1846, and its first vicar, Reverend Robert Aitken, was tasked to provide a church for the community. Aitken was renowned for his unusual preaching style and this was deemed to be well-suited to pull people away from the dominance of Methodism in the county’s mining communities. Aitken took it upon himself to design the church, the neighbouring vicarage and school, using local materials. Many of the fixtures and fittings were also made by local craftspeople, and Aitken donated his own collection of 16th century and 17th century Flemish and German glass roundels to enhance the windows. 1334 St John the Baptist Church, boundary walls, vicarage and school.

Traditionally, in Northern England, Iron Age and Romano-British native settlements take a variety of forms, with enclosures being defined by a bank and a ditch. Higher status enclosures, however, were formed of stone and have now been reduced to stony earthworks, as at East Mellwaters. The site is adjacent to other prehistoric settlement remains, which are thought to represent a succession of settlement sites established over the centuries. Architects Michael and Patty Hopkins built the house as a family home in 1975-1976, which also served as their office until the early 1980s. The couple designed and constructed the house as a study in making use of the maximum, flexible space of the site and were influenced by the Eames Case Study House of 1949. The house is notable for its energy efficiency, which includes the low thermal demands of the house, sparing use of materials and Venetian blinds. The highly elegant and economic lightweight steel frame and glass building made in the High-Tech tradition, is particularly eye-catching amongst the Victorian mansions typical of Hampstead and the Regency villas that make Downshire Hill distinctive from the rest of the village. The house won an RIBA award in 1977 and a Civic Trust Award in 1979. The couple jointly won the RIBA Gold Medal in 1994 and Michael Hopkins went on to receive a knighthood for his achievements in 1995.The former office of the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard. The Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Standard was founded in Malmesbury in 1837 and its production moved to Cirencester in 1840. It has continued to bring local news to the people of the two counties ever since. In 1904 the paper’s owner, George Henry Harmer, who had worked his way up through the firm from reporter to proprietor, sought to unite the printing and publishing arms of the paper on the same site for the first time, and commissioned local architect VA Lawson to design a new publishing office on a narrow site in Dyer Street, retaining the existing printing sheds to the rear. The resulting three-storey building has an imposing presence in a street of otherwise modest Cotswold buildings. It is in an Arts and Crafts style, taller than its neighbours, with jetties which project the elaborate timber-framed upper floors out over the street.In 1934, Rolls Royce leased two hangars at the Hucknall airfield, which was established in 1917, and created a testing programme there for aero engines and equipment. The building is largely intact and features many surviving fixtures dating back to the mid-20th century, including an engine-testing control panel, observation windows, wing spar mount assembly, roller doors, pierced metal sheet lining, as well as fittings and support for a de-tuner.  The site saw many world-leading developments such as the Merlin Engine, which was tested, developed and adapted for the American Mustang fighter aircraft there. The world’s first flight of a commercial jet aircraft flew from Hucknall to the Paris Air show in the late 1940s, using Frank Whittle’s jet engine which had been developed on site.

Newcastle on Clun, ShropshireThe lych gate to the east of Church of St John the Evangelist in Newcastle on Clun dates from 1880 and forms a picturesque entrance to St John’s churchyard. The design follows the Arts and Crafts traditions, bringing together joinery, ironmongery and slate work and is inspired by medieval predecessors. The roof mimics that of the lych gate claimed to be the oldest in the country, at the Church of St George in Beckenham, Kent, originally constructed in the 13th century. Within the timber-framed passageway of the lych gate is a revolving gate, which is an unusual feature and one of only a handful in existence in England. ‘Lych’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon or German word for corpse, and is named after the structure’s primary function of storing the coffin before burial. Lych gates also serve as a meeting point and shelter for funeral parties before they are met by the priest.The fishing industry in Newlyn on the south coast of Cornwall expanded in the 1880s, resulting in the construction of a new harbour and two piers. In the early 20th century, the south pier was extended to give better protection to the harbour and a tidal observatory was built at its north end. The observatory was one of three constructed at the request of Ordnance Survey to establish Mean Sea Level.The former lifeboat house, built in 1884, was designed by CH Cooke and represents the crucial role played by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in saving lives at sea since the 19th century. Its wide gabled structure and ornamental treatment, made up of fish-scale tiling, decorative moulded brick, and a beautifully incorporated bay window, create a finely detailed and strikingly composed building.2634 Cattle Trough and Drinking Fountain. Spaniards Road, HampsteadCattle troughs were once commonplace in Britain, with the politan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association (MDFCTA) responsible for over 1000 of them. Around 500 of these were located in London, however a large number have now been lost. The trough in Spaniards Road was believed to have been erected in 1916, making it a particularly late example of its type. Although the pump and spout mechanism are missing, the cattle trough is an important reminder that horse-drawn transport was commonplace in the early 20th century, despite the increasing use of motorised transport. In providing free drinking water for horses, charities like the MDFCTA also played an important role in raising standards in animal welfare.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered. Originally a formal gateway to a wealthy country house, it has been used for agricultural purposes since the 18th century. While very little is known about the house which the gatehouse served, the quality of the gatehouse signifies a substantial building of high status. It is a well-proportioned building with a red sandstone base, a tiled roof and good quality detailing, characteristic of this building type at the time it was built, around 1635. Of particular interest is the carved detailing around the archways and the elaborate plasterwork in the principal rooms inside the gatehouse. This listing means that it can now be assessed for inclusion on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk Register, which would enable Historic England to offer specialist technical advice to help secure its future.This early 17th century gatehouse to the former Caynton Manor is a remarkable survival, previously undiscovered.

Chipping Camden, Gloucestershire The garden at Kingcombe complements Grade II listed Kingcombe House. It is an increasingly rare survival of an Arts and Crafts garden laid out in the 1930s. The pre-war garden is well-preserved and is an impressive and thoughtful design which includes Italian influences in the terraced garden including Italian steps to ide it from the more functional parts of the garden and to provide a vertical link from the top of the terraces to the meadow beyond the garden. Intact gardens dating from the 1930s are rare in England. It was designed initially by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe and Russell Page with Sir Gordon Russell between 1927 and 1936 with later additions by Sir Gordon Russell from the 1940s through to the 1970s. During the Second World War and the austerity years that followed, few private houses were built so commissions for new gardens were few and far between.3034 Garden at Kingcombe.

Cappleside Barn in Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire was built in 1714. It is a large barn with a remarkable ornamental roof structure with carefully shaped timbers that also include carved motifs such as ‘daisy-wheels’. At first, Historic England thought that these roof timbers had been reused from a high-status medieval house, but dendrochronology has shown that the timbers came from trees felled shortly before the construction of the barn.

The Temple Mount, located within the Old City of Jerusalem, has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years. It is where Jesus is said to have cured a man’s blindness by sending him to wash in the Siloam Pool.The excavation revealed more than 100 coins trapped beneath paving stones. The latest coins were dated between 17AD and 31AD, which provides firm evidence that work began and was completed during the time that Pilate governed Judea.Study co-author Dr Donald Ariel, an archaeologist and coin expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: “Dating using coins is very exact.SWNS)“As some coins have the year in which they were minted on them, what that means is that if a coin with the date on it is found beneath the street, the street had to be built in the same year or after that coin had been minted, so any time after.“However, our study goes further, because statistically, coins minted some 10 years later are the most common coins in Jerusalem, so not having them beneath the street means the street was built before their appearance, in other words only in the time of Pilate.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers estimate that some 10,000 tons of quarried limestone rock was used in its construction, which the research team say would have required considerable skill.The opulent and grand nature of the street coupled with the fact that it links two of the most important spots in Jerusalem – the Siloam Pool and Temple Mount – is strong evidence that the street acted as a pilgrim’s route.Co-author Dr Joe Uziel, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: “If this was a simple walkway connecting point A to point B, there would be no need to build such a grand street.“At its minimum it is eight metres wide. This, coupled with its finely carved stone and ornate ‘furnishings’ like a stepped podium along the street, all indicate that this was a special street.”Study author Nahshon Szanton added: “Part of it may have been to appease the residents of Jerusalem, part of it may have been about the way Jerusalem would fit in the Roman world, and part of it may have been to aggrandise his name through major building projects.”The paving stones of the street were found hidden beneath layers of rubble, thought to be from when the Romans captured and destroyed the city in 70AD. The rubble contained weapons, including arrowheads and sling stones, remains of burnt trees, and collapsed stones from the buildings along its edge.The researchers say it is possible that Pilate had the street built to reduce tensions with the Jewish population.Dr Ariel added:“We can’t know for sure, although all these reasons do find support in the historical documents.”The study was published in the Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The poor poppets!So it’s not their fault they own multiple homes and cars, make millions in a “high-carbon” business and flit around the world in first class or on private jets. Nor that their carbon footprint is incalculably higher than millions of lesser mortals too poor to drive let alone fly.The system is to blame — not the luxuries they definitely won’t be giving up.We assume then that it’s not Lewis Hamilton’s fault he thrashes petrol cars for a living while demanding everyone  gives up meat to save the planet.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bluster from the cynical liar, a Tory Prime Minister making it up as he goes along, is unable to mask the humiliation of a lost extension rebellion. Start digging a deep Halloween ditch when his prospects of delivering Brexit by  October are vanishingly small. We should hold him to that vow to die politically. That, I concede, is likely to be another immediate broken promise from a shameless stranger to the truth.    Behaving like a spoiled brat, refusing to sign the letter he vowed never to send, only emphasised the desperation of a petulant Johnson without, admitted a Tory Cabinet Minister sitting on the committee overseeing Brexit preparations, a master plan. The Prime Minister who lives le on the hoof, doing what’s best for him at any mo, will continue bluffing in the hope of making Britain poorer and weaker with a bad deal worse than Theresa May’s. Johnson’s surrendered control of events, so evenSaturday’s Shambles is reversed he’ll never regain full control of events in Parliament. The answer from a senior member of Jeremy’s Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet - “I haven’t the foggiest” - when I asked what happens next was refreshingly honest. What we can see is Labour swinging towards a fresh referendum before a General Election probably delayed until next Spring.

MPs are snappy and irritable and bearing a collective headache that is preventing them from thinking straight. The uncertainty is not helping. The Government will today try  to hold a meaningful vote on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal  but this is expected to be ruled out of order by the Speaker on the grounds it is similar to the motion tabled on Saturday. Commons rules, depending on their interpretation, prevent the same motion being tabled in the same parliamentary sitting. If the vote does go ahead Downing Street is confident it has the numbers.

On Tuesday there will be the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill which will be weighed down with amendments like an over-decorated Christmas tree. These will include a fresh attempt to push for a softer Brexit based around UK membership of the customs union and yet another attempt for a second referendum. Brussels is reported to be waiting to seethe  Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes its second reading before deciding on whether to grant an extension.  My colleague Dan Bloom has done  an excellent explainer of how the week could pan out here . The problem for the anti-Brexiteers is they cannot agree on the best way forward. Justine Greening, for instance, this morning said she would back the amendment calling for a second referendum but not the one on the customs union.

He insisted Britain would still leave the EU on Halloween despite Boris Johnson being forced to request a three-month delay from EU leaders hours earlier.The Prime Minister last night sent a request to the EU to delay until January , deal or no deal, after MPs forced him to with a vote in Parliament. But he refused to sign it and sent a second signed note which branded an extension corrosive. That left questions over whether an extension would be granted or EU leaders would leave the UK to crash out with no deal. In a bid to leave on time, the PM is now racing to hold a fresh vote on his Brexit deal and get a Bill through the Commons to pass it into law in time for Halloween.    A Withdrawal Agreement Bill - which makes the Brexit deal law - will be introduced to Parliament on Monday and have its first debate on Tuesday. But Downing Street is facing a string of kne-edge votes to pass the Bill with no guarantee of success. And there will be a string of amendments - including for a customs union and second referendum - that could throw a spanner in the works. If the Bill does not get through, and European leaders refuse to delay Brexit, Britain faces no-deal next Thursday. Boris Johnson will try to have a fresh ‘meaningful vote’ on his deal tomorrow night to establishhe has the numbers. But he could be blockedSpeaker John Bercow decides the vote is outside Commons procedure. Mr Gove told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We are going to leave by October . We have the means and the ability to do so. He added: The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension.“ And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated. It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that,no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.

We are very excited - thereaposs a long way to go yet and next year will be so good.We canapost wait to find out the gender. I am feeling like itaposs a boy and we are very excited to share this journey with you. They then chatted to their son Oscar who said he wanted a new little sister.  The couple live with the majority of their kids in the Victorian property, a former care home, which they bought almost  years ago. And now they have revealed how they manage to all live together in the -bed four-storey house, which includes a basement. The Radfords first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting. Baby Bonnie  was the last addition to the brood in November bringing the number of children to a whopping . She arrived after a swt  minute labour weighing lb oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family.    Sue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits.

A large Ikea storage unit hides items inside such as cardigans and blankets, while two prams - including a double one - are also stored there, with a car seat perched nearby.  Proudly displayed on the wall are marathon certicates and medals. A shelf of shoes also sits in another corner full of trainers, boots, wellies and dolly shoes. Sue said: Anyone that comes in the house who hasnapost been before laughs at this shoe storage. As you can image we go through lots of them [shoes]. The massive dining table takes centre stage and has  leather chairs and two high chairs around it.

Plastic surgery addict Sam Barton was overwhelmed with joy when he found out a mystery admirer had stumped up the cash for his transplant in Istanbul, Turkey. The wealthy businesswoman told him to aposstay ruthlessapos when he thanked her for covering the cost of his entire trip.Mr Barton decided to get a full transplant after he became self-conscious about his thinning hair, Birmingham Live reports.   He set up a crowdfunding page to pay for the procedure, leading the wealthy businesswoman to get in touch and bankroll the whole thing. Mr Barton, from Four Oaks, Sutton Coldfield said: I wasn’t bald but my hair was thin. I felt I was getting old and ugly and I wanted to do something about it. I flew over to Istanbul and was taken to a lovely hotel. I then went over to the clinic for the hair translant. I was given some food, a drink and everything was spoken to me in English so I knew exactly what was going on. The transplant went really well and a week on it is coming along very nicely. The aftercare from the team in Turkey has also been very good and they have been checking up on me.    The trouble is I have the urge to get something  done now. Speaking about the mystery benefactor who paid for the procedure, he added: She is very successful and said she admires my bravery and honesty, then she offered to pay for it all. It was £, including flights and hotel. I am really grateful for her generosity. Many people will criticise me and question why I didn’t pay for it myself butsomeone offers then I am not going to say no.

But Severn Trent claims the problem is coming from a leaking private pipe on a nearby council property which they are trying to get access to.    It’s a nightmare. Iaposm a proud, private person and do not want to ask anyone for help. I’m suffering mentally. I’m scratching my arms and legs, Miss Francis said. I’m thinking all the time, when am I going to get water  When is this problem going to get sorted  My grandkids would come and stay over but now they can’t. I canapost turn on the central heating because the pressure is low, I just wrap myself in duvet and stay in my bedroom. I cannot cook because I’m scared of the water running out. Sometimes I just eat at work. I used to cook a lot m- nothing beats your own food, your own bath and your own toilet.    The trouble started last December when the water started running low in the bathroom. Miss Francis spent nearly £ on a new shower unit, thinking that would solve the issue but it didn’t. She then contacted Severn Trent who sent out ious workers to look at the problem. But the company claims it has been unable to gain access to the council property to look at the pipe. The care worker added: I kept ringing and ringing them and nothing. They just kept saying they were trying to get in the house concerned and they couldn’t. I decided I had had enough so I contacted the Consumer Council for Water but they could not do anything until Severn Trent had gone through all the steps.” Miss Francis submitted a formal complaint on October .  She has since heard that the problem has been caused by a leak on the private pipe which feeds all the nearby homes. Chaman Lal, councillor for Soho and the Jewellery Quarter, said: The housing manager sent a team of plumbers to check the property for leaks and there’s no problem which makes me angry. Severn Trent don’t know what they are doing or do not want to know. This is appalling. A spokesman for Severn Trent said: We’re really sorry for the problems Ms. Francis has experienced over recent months with her water supply. We understand that long periods of low water pressure must be extremely frustrating for her. Our engineers have been out to investigate the cause a number of times but, unfortunately efforts to fix the problem have proved to be complicated.

However, the head of the baby had been removed, complete with fake blood, and placed at the foot of the figurine. It has been branded absolutely tragic and tasteless by members of the public. Within hours of being contacted via its social media channels, the Red Cross conceded the display had fallen short of reasonable expectations and had ordered its removal. On Sunday morning when the Daily Echo visited the premises at Southbourne Grove, the display - which forms part of a larger Halloween display - was still there.    Other elements of the display included a full glass bottle, labelled as aposHuman Bloodapos, a skeleton and a number of white tissues daubed with fake blood. The member of the public, who contacted the Daily Echo with the images - but asked not to be named - said: I canapost believe that a Red Cross shop in Southbourne, Bournemouth, has this in display. Absolutely tragic and tasteless. He took the images around pm on Saturday. Other Twitter users agreed, with Jules Cole saying: This is shocking. Southbourne resident Peter West told the Echo: I can see how people may be offended, especially as it appears to be Mary and Jesus, or at least based on that image. That may have been overlooked by whoever put it up, maybe they just wanted to make something ghoulish for Halloween. I doubt there is any bad intention.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton have both taken inspiration from Princess Diana, a body language expert has revealed. Judi James exclusively told MirrorOnline how both royals are incredibly adept when it comes to interacting with children during royal engagements. Both women use some very smart body language rituals to put both them and the youngsters they meet at ease during their royal visits. Apart from Meghan’s new role as a mother and Kate’s full immersion in the skills of being a mum to three, there are several clues to the secret of their success. Hereaposs what body language expert Judy James has to say: The Diana factor  Diana really did set the new template for natural, tactile behaviour on royal tours. She broke with royal tradition that tended to dictate a visiting royal would do little more than receive bouquets from the kids and smile while retaining a regal, dignied posture and facial expression. The memory created in the people they met was more one of having seen a very special, high-status person. Diana’s techniques of self-lowering, such as diminishing her own status, signals to make people feel at ease allowed both Kate and Meghan to reach out to children at their own level instead. Mirroring techniques    Both Kate and Meghan employ some very clever mirroring techniques with the children they meet to allow for a more natural and less over-awed response. Meghan’s tour even involved some mirroring with her clothing, opting for denims and casual wear rather than a more formal, regal look. Once she learns the steps of the dancing the girls are doing in these clips she mimics their steps with a lack of inhibition to allow them all to be enjoying the same experience at the same time. Kate dips down to the same level as the smaller children she is meeting and we can see her mimicking their ‘baby wave’ rituals, with a low, childlike wave ritual as she approaches and leaves them. Status-swapping    Kate and Meghan both lower their own status and power signals to raise the confidence levels of the children they meet. Meghan approaches the dancers with a head-tilt and slightly shy smile, carefully watching and eye-checking the dancers before picking up their steps. She allows them to teach her and in both these clips she is taking her learning seriously, putting the power in the hands of the children. Kate is seen playing with some children at a table and again she is watching them and appearing to learn from then rather than the other way round. When she approaches the group of children that are standing to meet her she immediately uses self-diminishing techniques to lower her own status with them, pulling her arms into her body and lowering to their height. All this body language self-lowering would have the effect of boosting the young childrens’ confidence.

Jodie Marsden, , has told how she was in utter agony, saying she was able to feel the clamp, suction, jiggling and aposshovingapos inside her. She says she was in so much pain she could barely whisper. The mum says she had no idea of the nightmare that lay ahead when she arrived at hospital to be induced - but it left her vowing to never get pregnant again. After two days of very slow labour, Jodieaposs unborn babyaposs heart started to dip with every contraction and doctors rushed her into theatre for an emergency c-section. They gave her an epidural - an anaesthetic around the spinal cord - and while it worked at first, Jodie said she began to feel pain.    Thankfully baby Arthur was healthy but the whole experience - which happened on Friday th - has put Jodie off having any more kids. Jodie from Wakefield said: I could feel them juggling about inside my stomach - one person was shoving down on the top of my stomach whilst another was pulling the baby out. It was agony. I could feel the clamp inside me and the suction going around and I was really struggling to breathe. The whole experience was absolutely terrying and I am totally traumatised from the birth. We said ourselves that he would wait until Friday the th to make an appearance, and then we noticed it was a full moon, but it never crossed our mind what would happen. I could feel them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles and I was in extreme pain. It felt like I was screaming in pain, but my partner said it was only coming out as a whisper, but luckily they could see I was uncomfortable. Iaposm never having another baby ever again, thataposs for sure.    Dog groomer Jodie was in no rush to start a family after tying the knot with husband Matt, , in September . She fell pregnant unexpectedly weeks later, but sadly miscarried at just seven weeks. The miscarriage changed Jodieaposs thoughts on motherhood, and after celebrating their first Christmas as a married couple, the pair found out Jodie was pregnant again. Jodie said: We didnapost actually plan on having children so soon after the wedding, as Iaposm a very career driven person and wanted to focus on my dog grooming business. Iaposve never really been a maternal person, it was never something I had in a plan and I could never see myself with children, but the miscarriage changed my way of thinking. After the miscarriage, I was convinced that there was something wrong with me. We had no plans to try again, we just went with the flow and saidit happens, then it happens, andit doesnapost, then it wasnapost supposed to be. I found out I was pregnant again just after Christmas, and although I was happy, it was a tough set of emotions to deal with as I was convinced it was all going to happen again.  She developed pregnancy hypertension in the last six weeks of her pregnancy so was induced on her due date,  September , at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield. Doctors administered an epidural, but two days later, she had only dilated cm and was given a hormone drip as well to encourage her baby to arrive. As the contractions started, doctors grew concerned when Jodieaposs unborn childaposs blood pressure dropped dangerously and prepped the young mum for an emergency c-section. Once in theatre, doctors upped the dose of Jodieaposs epidural, but despite checks to ensure she was numb, she says all hell broke loose when she could suddenly feel everything. Jodie said: They did multiple checks to make sure I was numb, with an ice cold spray on several areas of my stomach, followed by jabbing me with a needle, and all was fine, I was numb. For the incision, I just felt slight pressure, but then I felt them actually pulling my stomach apart as they were ripping the muscles and I was in so much pain. The anaesthetist was asking meit was pain or pressure, and I was saying pain, but Matt said it was just like a whisper coming out of me. They could see I was uncomfortable, so they gave me more medication to try and get the pain under control but I was still in pain.  Jodie says her pain relief from the epidural had stopped working in the middle of her c-section, and the first time mum was able to feel the entire procedure. Her blood pressure rose dangerously and after her baby Arthur was born, doctors were forced to put her under general anaesthetic, fearing she might suffer a stroke or heart attack, she told. The young mum lost . pints of blood and stayed in theatre for another hour and a half before being monitored in recovery for  hours. Jodie said: When they finally pulled Arthur out, all I remember was hearing this little scream which suddenly stopped. I canapost remember seeing him, and I turned to Matt and repeatedly asked him aposWhere is my baby apos Then it was like an out of body experience, I could hear things but it was like I was just watching from above. I could hear them saying they needed to get the bleeding under control, and then the anaesthetist said aposWeaposre going to have to send you to sleepapos. They escorted Matt out and then took Arthur to see him and my mum, but I had to stay in theatre for another hour and a half without holding my baby. Before the c-section, the anaesthetist told me that general anaesthetic is literally the last resort because itaposs best for mums to have skin to skin contact straight away, but nothing was working for me so they had to do it.  Jodie finally got to hold her baby boy Arthur the next day, and thankfully the young mum is now doing well and is back home with her family. Traumatised by the experience, Jodie has decided not to have any more children and is focusing on raising her only son.

The two men both looked smart and handsome in their red, black and gold military unorms, which were specially made for the historical day. However Harry had an alteration made to his Household Cavalryaposs Blues and Royals outfit, asking for a secret pocket to be sewn in. Tailor Kashket  Partners, who made both Harry and Williamaposs outfits as well as the page boysapos outfits, accepted the challenge and their clever work meant the small compartment attached to the golden cuff was impossible to see. Harry wanted the pocket to make sure one of his most important jobs of the day went down without a hitch - and it worked a treat.    It is customary for the best man to carry the ring in his trouser or jacket pocket but Harryaposs slimline suit made this impossible. This meant he needed somewhere  to put the welsh gold ring William would place on Kateaposs finger during the ceremony. A spokesman for Kashket  Partners said: Harry, aware that he would be waving to the crowds, feared he may drop the ring and wanted a secret compartment. The royal brothers wanted the day to run effortlessly smoothly and decided this would be the best option. Harryaposs proved to be the perfect choice when it came to Williamaposs best man, and he also delivered a moving speech at the private evening reception.    He also acted as Master of Ceremonies and took to his feet in front of  of the couple’s closest friends and ­family. According to guests, there was barely a dry eye as Harry turned to William and told him: “Our mother would be so very proud of you.” A source revealed: “Harry only said a few words, but it was so emotional. The entire room burst into applause.” Wearing a fez hat Harry had started his speech by standing on the top table and describing the newlyweds as the “Dude and Duchess”.    As guests chuckled, he poked fun at William’s ­receding hairline and said he felt sorry for Kate marrying a “bald man”. He handed over to two of William’s oldest pals, who cracked jokes that had him ­laughing hysterically. Double act James Meade, who William, , met at Eton, and Thomas Van Straubenzee, a friend from William’s Ludgrove Prep School in ­Berkshire, ­recounted tales of William’s ­“debauchery” and “nakedness” as a ­bachelor.

Over the course of a letime some people can spend thousands inking their bodies and one mortician is now offering a controversial service to turn tattoos into aposfine artapos. Michael Sherwood, from Cleveland, gives grieving families the option after a death of keeping the tattooed skin as parchment-like artwork they can hang in their homes in remembrance. It all started a few years ago when Michael and his son Kyle were having a few drinks with their friends and they got on to the topic of how much tattoos mean to people.   Being the go-to guys for death related questions, one of Michaelaposs friends told him he would like his tattoo preserved when he passes, as reported by news.au .The dad and son team laughed it off at first but when their friend pushed his idea, they began to give it real consideration. With the art in tattoos and how much they mean to people, why not keep them after they die  said Kyle. People put ashes in urns on mantles and visit stones with their loved oneaposs names on them. Why not keep their tattoos as a memorial  From bar banter chat over a beer, the aposSave My Ink Foreverapos service was born.    Kyle explained the aposy processapos takes three to four months and is started within  hours of the personaposs death, with the tattoo being aposexcisedapos at the funeral home. They say the process doesnapost interfere with traditional viewing or cremation and is done with the usual standard of dignity and respect - although they draw the line at preserving face and genital tattoos. The good news for families who choose to hang the inkings on their walls is that there is aposno maintenanceapos and the skin should be treated aposas you would fine artapos. aposSave My Ink Foreverapos has received some backlash - with the pair even being compared to Ed Gein, a murderer notorious for making clothes and masks from his victimaposs bodies.  Michael and Kyle instead focus on the wishes on the loved oneaposs family, although they have had to knock back requests to make lamp shades and book covers from the skin. We are helping families and fulfilling their last wishes, Kyle added.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA ,-year-old aposlostapos street built in Jerusalem by Pontius Pilate has been uncovered for the first time since the city was sacked by the Romans in AD. The ancient walkway most likely used by pilgrims as they made their way to worship at the Temple Mount was first discovered in  by British archaeologists in the City of David within the walls of Jerusalem. Researchers have now found more than  coins beneath the paving stones that date the street to around the year AD. The finding provides strong evidence that the street was commissioned by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of the province Judaea, best known for being the official who presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucixion.    After six years of extensive archaeological excavations, researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered a  metre-long section of an ancient street The walkway ascends from the Pool of Siloam in the south to the Temple Mount. Both monuments are hugely signicant to followers of Judaism and Christianity. The Temple Mount, located within the Old City of Jerusalem, has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years. At the time of the streetaposs construction, it is where Jesus is said to have cured a manaposs blindness by sending him to wash in the Siloam Pool. The excavation revealed more than  coins trapped beneath paving stones. The latest coins were dated between AD and AD, which provides firm evidence that work began and was completed during the time that Pilate governed Judea. Study co-author Dr Donald Ariel, an archaeologist and coin expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: Dating using coins is very exact.  As some coins have the year in which they were minted on them, what that means is thata coin with the date on it is found beneath the street, the street had to be built in the same year or after that coin had been minted, so any time after. However, our study goes further, because statistically, coins minted some  years later are the most common coins in Jerusalem, so not having them beneath the street means the street was built before their appearance, in other words only in the time of Pilate. The street -  metres long and around eight metres wide - was paved with large stone slabs, as was customary throughout the Roman Empire. The researchers estimate that some , tons of quarried limestone rock was used in its construction, which the research team say would have required considerable skill. The opulent and grand nature of the street coupled with the fact that it links two of the most important spots in Jerusalem - the Siloam Pool and Temple Mount - is strong evidence that the street acted as a pilgrimaposs route. Co-author Dr Joe Uziel, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: If this was a simple walkway connecting point A to point B, there would be no need to build such a grand street. At its minimum it is eight metres wide. This, coupled with its finely carved stone and ornate aposfurnishingsapos like a stepped podium along the street, all indicate that this was a special street.

The -year-old girl called Diana was found after escaping her cage and walking on all fours “like a frightened animal” in the street. The child makes barking noises instead of talking, is unable to walk standing up on two feet, sleeps on the floor and looks half her age, according to reports. It is claimed the girlaposs mother forced her to live in a cage at times and in a dilapidated shed with a cow during the summer months.    The mother-of-eight has denied the claims and police are now investigating the disturbing allegations of abuse and neglect. The child is suffering from “exhaustion” and being treated in hospital following her escape in the Russian city of Oryol. A hospital source told the Oryol Times: “The mother is an alcoholic. This is her eighth child. “The previous seven were taken away by ship authorities.  “The mother hid this child in every possible way. “At home - she was kept in a cage, andshe had to go somewhere, carried her a bag on wheels. “For a bottle of vodka, she sold the girl into sexual slavery.” Police intervened and the child was removed from her mother, Madina, , and she is now receiving help, said senior hospital physician Lyudmila Krylova.  The mother, from the Chechnya region, has not been charged with a crime. She and neighbours denied the sexual slavery claims. She told REN TV that claims she had traded her daughter to paedophiles for vodka was “bulls***”. Madina has claimed the child was “sick” and there was “nothing she could do about it”.  Russian media showed images of girl curled up in a ball in hospital and the shed where she was allegedly forced to live. The girl’s father, from Belarus, died earlier this year. There were claims that Diana had been disabled since birth. A criminal case into alleged negligence has been launched against child care officials who were accused of failing to protect Diana.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da98c1ca3e9a5.80841723.jpg ","title":"gap talk irks winger declan mcdaid as dee seek wins","story":"Dundee attacker Declan McDaid insists any talk of the league being over after their derby defeat has only served to spur them on.The Dark Blues lost - to city rivals Dundee United at the end of August to open up a gap of seven points at the top of the Championship.Some had written off the Dee that night and made the Terrors favourites for the title.However, ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with Partick Thistle at Dens Park, McDaid has sullied such talk and insists they are only focused on winning back-to-back for the first time in the league this season and pushing up the table.“It was never over,” the former Partick and Ayr United man said.“People keep saying that ‘gap’, what was it seven points  We were four games in!“This league is never over that early and we weren’t even thinking about anything to do with that.“We were just trying to get our results right, which we have been.“We just need to keep that up and see what happens.

We’re looking forward to a hard game.“Arbroath was a big win for us and we’ve had the wee break so we’re recharged.“Training’s been at a good tempo and boys are back in working hard, getting ready for tomorrow.”On getting off the mark for the season, McDaid said: “It’s massive for me. We’d been playing well as a team and I’d been doing alright myself but I hadn’t really been getting loads of chances.“In the final third, it’s good that’s it’s coming now because I’d been unlucky for a few weeks before that.“I had a few chances against Alloa and in other games but I was glad to get it out of the way because it was starting to get in my head a wee bit.“Now that I’ve got them, I’m feeling confident to go on and get more to kick on from here.”Coming up against former club Partick and his boss at Ayr Ian McCall, McDaid knows the Dark Blues will be in for a stern test.However, he feels the side is only growing in confidence and will have no fears going into the clash.“Ian McCall, my old manager from Ayr, has just went there so I know him and how he’ll have them playing football. vw, px\"  “There’ll be a freedom to their play and it’ll be a tough game. Every match is tough in this league, you could say.“They’ll have a wee spring in their step, though, with beating Inverness away which was a good result.“We’re confident in our ability, so, hopefully, we’ll go and get the three points.“At the start of the season it just wasn’t clicking, something wasn’t right but it’s starting to click now, we feel.“We won the last game so, hopefully, we can really kick on from here.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/medw-john-nelms-dens-6-846x564.jpg ","title":"its more than just a new stadium dundee fc directors vision for new grounds","story":"When Dundee FC managing director John Nelms looks at the prospect of a new, state-of-the-art stadium at Camperdown, he sees so much more than just a football ground.The complex would include a new conference centre – potentially bringing millions to the city – as well as hotels, restaurants, flats and a crematorium among other plans.In short, it would be an entertainment hub for all the family, operating all-year-round.“I think it’s important we talk about it as more than a football stadium and, in fact, we don’t talk about the football side very much,” said Nelms. vw, px\"  “The football club uses it - times a year while the rest of the time it’s something  other than a stadium for football – which is obviously most of the time.“We want the football fans to have the best possible time they can, but the other  days, we want everyone  that comes on the site to say ‘this is a great place to be, I want to go back there’.“That’s what we want to happen.”The development and construction of the project itself has been frustrating for Nelms and Dundee owner Tim Keyes, the men behind Dark Blue Property Holdings, which is driving the new stadium plans.In terms of the here and now, Nelms admits development of the project has slowed down.Lending partners have been identied and Nelms is working closely with them to find a way forward.He said: “As soon as we get confirmation of a plan of how financing will work and it works for us, we’ll press the button and all the consultants and everybody are back up to speed.“Gregor Hamiltonis patiently waiting for these documents to come through.“Because it’s so large and has so many dferent parts, our consultants have been working with the council to give them the workings in stages.“That will be based on how we’ve agreed to drop them in and ensure it’s the way they want it done.“In our pre-meetings, which were over a year ago, we met with neighbours and local groups as well as those who had concerns.“All of those things have happened – though it feels like a long, long time ago.”Nelms sees the prospect of bringing the stadium to Dundee, on land next to Dundee Ice Arena, as the next stage of the city’s re-birth.He has watched, since arriving in , the Waterfront development and the city as a whole growing as time goes on.He is sure a new stadium complex will bring in even more tourism.Nelms believes it’s important to build on the positivity surrounding Dundee by helping produce a venue hosting events which would attract people from all around Scotland.“You have to have momentum, you can’t rest on your laurels, you’ve got to build around that and add more to Dundee,” he said.“You want people to spend the night here, spend more money so we have to give them multiple things.“That’s one of our goals. Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests. He added:“We can have concerts for up to , at slessor Gardens but we’d like to have concerts which host , people. That means we can bring acts to Dundee which would pass us over on a regular basis.“We’ll have conference space which can offer -, spaces and that’s what we want to go after.#John Nelms insists Dundee are in the process of recovering after relegation last season.The managing director says changes behind the scenes have seen the club moving in a dferent direction, after the appointments of James McPake as manager and Gordon Strachan as technical director.He said: “The Championship has been a big change, luckily we planned for some change and it has allowed us to move a few things around the club.“Obviously the manager has changed, we’re changing things in the academy by bringing Gordon in and once we got through all the negativity of being relegated we could focus on bringing the club back up again.“I think we’ve done that. We have a young manager and he has a lot of good people around him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da9b21fc578c4.50609098.jpg ","title":"louis appere ive got perfect role model in mcculloch","story":"Young Dundee United striker Louis Appere says he’s got the perfect role model in former Rangers and Scotland man Lee McCulloch.The ex-Kilmarnock player and manager has taken -year-old Appere under his wing at Tannadice as the youngster has emerged into the first team.Both are celebrating along with manager Robbie Neilson and McCulloch’s fellow-assistant Gordon Forrest after signing contract extensions until the summer of .Appere said: “Lee McCulloch has been brilliant with me and really helped me a lot.“He has played in the same position as me and has helped with a lot of dferent things, looking back at games, training drills that he wants me to work on and things I can do better.“If I can aim for it, I’d be very happy to have a career like his.“He just tells me to believe in myself, that’s the big thing and take what I do in training into games.“I feel I’m starting to do that now.”Appere has shot to prominence in the United first team after impressing in pre-season.He’s featured  times this campaign for the Tangerines, scoring twice, and is determined to kick on now he has his future at the club sealed, for the next two-and-a-half years anyway.“I’m really happy to get it all signed and done,” Appere said.“Since I came in at the start of the season, it’s been great.“I maybe didn’t expect to start the very first game but the manager gave me a chance after a good pre-season so I now want to repay the faith he has shown in me.“I think going out on loan to Broughty Athletic in the juniors last season gave me a lot of confidence which has helped.“All the coaches at United, too, have been great with me through pre-season and then coming in for the first few games, they were all really positive.“I always backed myself in the first teamI got a chance.“I knew I would at least give everything I had.”He added: “This contract is a big moment.“Before the season, I wasn’t a first-team regular and now to be classed as that is a good feeling – I just want to make sure I stay a first-team regular now.”Appere is in the squad for today’s clash at Queen of the South as the Tangerines aim to get back to winning ways following the - defeat to Alloa a fortnight ago."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/Riverside-Internal.jpg ","title":"sponsored newly renovated dundee pub celebrates opening","story":"The Riverside Inn on Riverside Drive officially reopened its doors this week following an extensive transformation.General Manager Catherine Blunn and her team are looking forward to welcoming guests back to the pub, following a six-figure investment.Catherine said: “Our brand-new pub and grill offers something for everyone.

with Hibs at Pittodrie a fortnight ago.Lewis Ferguson and Curtis Main dropped out due to suspension, Dean Campbell and Ryan Hedges were moved to the bench and Ethan Ross dropped out of the -man squad altogether.In came Mikey Devlin, McGinn, Jon Gallagher, James Wilson and Vyner.With six defenders on the pitch there was intrigue as to how the Reds would line-up pre-match.The answer was a --- formation with Vyner and Greg Leigh used as holding midfielders.The match roared into le with both sides looking to get on the front foot in the early stages and in the fth minute Motherwell passed up a great chance to take the lead.Shay Logan was short with a pass back to keeper Lewis, Chris Long nipped in first and was tripped by Lewis, with referee Euan Anderson quickly pointing to the penalty spot.Scott stepped up, but his right footed effort was tipped over the bar by Lewis, who flung himself to his right.After quarter of an hour Aberdeen took the lead with a devastating counter-attack.The Steelmen#s skipper Peter Hartley was off the pitch receiving treatment for an injury with Barry Maguire dropping into central defence and marking Cosgrove.Long had possession for the home side, but Leigh tackled him in the centre of the pitch and the alert Cosgrove spun away from Maguire. Leigh found him with the perfect through ball and the striker raised into the box and chipped the beyond Mark Gillespie for his th goal of the season.Soon after Jon Gallagher headed over from a Logan cross, but midway through the first period Motherwell hit the woodwork.Declan Gallagher#s measured ball found the lively Long on the right side of the area, he side-stepped Lewis, but with the angle against him Long#s attempted finish hit the right post and went behind.Up until the interval the same pattern continued with Motherwell having more of the ball, but struggling to penetrate the Dons defence, while the men from the Granite City appeared threatening when they were able to counter-attack at speed.Eight minutes into the second half the Reds left the Steelmen with a mountain to climb as they moved two up.Aberdeen pressed Motherwell and when Allan Campbell dithered  yards from goal McGinn pounced. The Northern Irish international won the ball and curled a shot into the top right corner from the edge of the area.Any hopes of a home comeback were extinguished on the hour when Vyner created space  yards out and hammered a right footed shot in off the right post.By now Motherwell were ragged at the back and Leigh#s cross-cum-shot slipped just wide.Andy Considine also sent a header by the far post in the closing stages, but it finished -.Motherwell: Mark Gillespie, Richard Tait, Liam Grimshaw, Peter Hartley , Allan Campbell, Christopher Long, Sherwin Seedorf, Barry Maguire , James Scott , Liam Polworth, Declan Gallagher.Subs not used: Trevor Carson, Christy Manzinga, Christian Ilic, Jamie Semple.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Andy Considine, Mikey Devlin, Scott McKenna, Greg Leigh , Jon Gallagher, Zak Vyner, James Wilson , Niall McGinn , Sam Cosgrove.Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Craig Bryson, Ryan Hedges, Bruce Anderson."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da0aa4eef9f61.66247159-391x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet jeff theo and gypsy are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This little bundle of energy may look cute, but he will be quite a bit of work for a new owner.Jeff, who is eight months old, is friendly and full of mischief, but has had no training and will need someone to start from scratch with him, including his toilet training.Jeff had been suffering from #cherry eye# but this has now been sorted by vets and hopefully won’t cause further issues.This handsome puss is quite an independent boy.Theo does enjoy cuddles, but only on his terms.The kitty, who is  months old, has been an indoor cat previously but he is really keen to get out, so he’ll need a new owner who is able to give him access to do this.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre.

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Oklahoma will be reborn for the third time on the Memorial Hall stage, by a young cast saddling up and taking the reins of their second show. Peeblesshire News reporter Hilary Scott joined the hoedown rehearsal last Wednesday and spoke with the cast as they prepared for the upbeat cowboy classic.Rodgers and Hammersteinrsquos collaboration is uniquely adapted for youth performers who are working hard to bring you a rootinrsquo tootinrsquo, chap-slapping show.It comes from the prodigies of Innerleithen Opera, who last year brought the rags to riches tale of orphan Annie to le.The success of their debut performance led to calls for another show, and the young actors from KIYT jumped at the chance to take to the stage again.They are stepping back to a time before any of them were born. Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her! Shersquos taken up with the Peddler man who doesnrsquot want her.Meanwhile cowboy Will Parker desperately wants the irrepressible Annie to be his bride. But for him its lsquoall of nothinrsquo. However, Ado Annie has just one problem when shersquos with a fella ndash lsquoshe canrsquot say no!rsquoRiding ahead of the herd of romanticised cowboy land is Laureyrsquos wise-cracking Aunt Eller. If anyone can sort out the messy love triangle itrsquos her.As rehearsals get under way in the Library Hall Irsquom at a loose end until I can grab some of the principals for a chat.Deep within this building is the most magical wardrobe, which has been bringing characters to le in many a show performed by Innerleithen and District Operatic Society.Seamstresses Rhona McGlasson and Susan McGinn have been working the needle and thread for more years than they care to remember, but they tell me itrsquos ldquoplaytime to them, and they are often scouring charity shops for bargains.I cast my eye over the checks, neck scarfs, and long floral dresses. ldquoThe youngsters love trying on their costumes, says Rhona. ldquoItrsquos like playing dressing up.Between scenes I catch up with some of the cast. First up was Curlyhis rival Jud Fryand Andrew Carnes .Itrsquos Finrsquos first show with KIYT and hersquos looking forward to playing the lovelorn cowboy. ldquoI was hoping to play Curly, hersquos a kind guy with a big heart. Rehearsals are fun, I enjoy acting with everyone. They are a great group of people.Oliver is playing Ado Anniersquos protective father Andrew Carnes, who doesnrsquot want cowboy Will Parker to marry his daughter.ldquoHe is a bold character and fatherly figure, said Oliver. ldquoIrsquom working on the accent, itrsquos going pretty well.And the most feared character is Jud Fry, played by Nathan Pirie. I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character. Hersquos a dark person. Irsquom looking forward to the wedding scene when I have a fight with Curly.This yearrsquos leading lady is Neve Scott, who last year made her debut performance with KIYT as the con-woman Lily St Regis in Annie.Neve played the ditsy, whiney floozy, but this year will grace this stage as the head-strong farm girl Laurey, who secretly loves Curly.She said: ldquoThis role is the complete opposite to the character I played last year which is great. I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it. The whole cast are great and I canrsquot wait to perform with them.Angela Grant is new to KIYT and has landed the role of the feisty Aunt Eller. ldquoI watched the film but I really started to like my character when we began rehearsing. Itrsquos my first acting role and Irsquom enjoying being part of a musical theatre group. When all the cast get together for scenes therersquos a great atmosphere.I caught up with George Brydon who is saddling up to play cowboy Will Parker. ldquoI feel very excited to play Will because hersquos a happy-go-lucky sort of guy with some sick moves, and Irsquom looking forward to learning the two-step. Irsquom loving being in Oklahoma. Itrsquos a great show with classic songs.Unfortunately I didnrsquot get the chance to catch all the cast ndash perhaps Ado Annie was too busy to peel herself away from the smooth-talking cowboys!I did, however, sneak a peek at the auction scene being rehearsed. Whilst bids of dollars, saddles and even a horse are being hollered, I make my bid and buy a ticket for this show, because this cast are doing grand in Oklahoma and theyrsquore gonna treat you great!Tickets for the shows on November ,  and  are now available from the Thrt Shop or The Hub in Innerleithen, Graham McGrathrsquos, Peebles, www.idas.org.uk booking@idaos.org.uk, Facebook inneropera, or by phoning  ."},{"url":null,"title":"end-era","story":"FOR one night, and one night only, Billy Connolly is gting us one last laugh in an exclusive screening of his last tour.Filmed during the final leg of his Australia tour in , The Sex Le of Bandagesis a stark reminder of Connollys hilarity and humanity.Viewers arent just shown Billy in his natural habitat of the stand-up stage, we also get an eye opening look into his personal le since his Parkinsons Disease diagnosis in .

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic final minute sees young pupils take points","story":"With a dramatic finish to the game the Pupils Youth Under s ed to Kintyre with all three points after a tight encounter played at Glasgow Club Milton on Sunday.This was the first time the sides had met and the Pupils knew they would be in for another tough test on the road playing against a side which won the GADYFL B Division last season.The visitors showed no signs of their early journey to the north end of Glasgow as they started brightly and enjoyed the majority of possession early in the game. However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

area.According to the developers: ldquoThe old manse is currently empty following the decision by the former tenant, Church of Scotland, to relocate their social work services to an alternative location.ldquoGiven the previous and historic residential use of the building, it is now considered timely and appropriate to revert this vacant building back to a residential use.ldquoThe building has had several internal alterations over the years and, as such, will benefit from a comprehensive internal remodelling to bring the building up to st-century standards.ldquoRather than try to provide a single residential unit, we consider that a more appropriate use will be to split the building into four units, thereby complying with good practice on appropriate re-use of buildings and making efficient use of land for housing.The plans show a three-bedroom and one-bedroom apartment on the ground floor, with a two-bedroom apartment on the first floor.The second floor would also contain a two-bedroom apartment.Further development of the site could take also place in the future.The developer noted that the current proposals formed the second part of a three-phase plan.The first phase, which is already complete, saw more than a dozen properties built on the site.Meanwhile, the final phase is a social housing proposal, with no planning application yet with the local authority.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, said ldquohigh-quality infill developments had to be

the work is done.Until then, a section of the north side of the road is closed and traffic lights in place, leading to delays for motorists.Michael Owens, of the Coal Authorityrsquos public safety and

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"music-liam-gallagher-oasis-getting-back-together---definitely-maybe","story":"HAS Liam Gallagher turned over a new leaf  There is something very dferent about the bad boy of Britpop in .Itrsquos clear, Gallagher has been taking stock of both his le and career.The singer is in talk-mode to sell his impressive second solo album, Why Me  Why Not  which reached No.  on the UK Chart.We chat on the eve of his th birthday.

These are the perks of the millions people, folk with way more money than they could possibly use, as a result of our impossibly liberal rulers declining to imprison anyone earning more than pound, a year.Reading about royalties ldquoearned by the Royals prompted me to feel unusually discontented about the financial situation this week.Tucked away in a story about Her Majesty, a Queen, and Charles, a Prince, standing to make more than pound million a year from the expansion of windfarms off the coasts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was the intelligence that the late Queen Mother amassed a pound million legacy before departing to have a gin and Dubonnet with God.As the law prevents scrutiny of Royal wills, we cannot know how this sum was acquired.

He was respected as a sculptor and architect, but no sculpture or buildings by him survive. He was a military and civil engineer who plotted with Machiavelli to ert the river Arno, but the scheme was never executed.Da Vinci was also an anatomist and dissected  human corpses.But his groundbreaking anatomical work was never published ndash and he planned treatises on painting, water, mechanics, the growth of plants and many other subjects, although none was ever finished.ldquoAs so much of his lersquos work was unrealised or destroyed, Leonardorsquos greatest achievements survive only in his drawings and manuscripts, say the Royal Collection Trust.ldquoThe drawings by Leonardo in the Royal Collection have been together as a group since the artistrsquos death in , and entered the Collection during the reign of Charles II, around .ldquoLeonardo firmly believed that visual evidence was more persuasive than academic argument, and that an image conveyed knowledge more accurately and concisely than any words.ldquoFew of his drawings were intended for others to see: drawing served as his laboratory, allowing him to work out his ideas on paper and search for the universal laws that he believed underpinned all of creation.ldquoIn the breadth of his interests, Leonardo was the archetypal lsquoRenaissance manrsquo, and his work is characterised by a multitude of artistic and scientic pursuits that cross-fertilised each other over many years.Da Vincirsquos research into the human body stemmed from a desire to be ldquotrue to nature in his painting, and in time anatomy became his greatest scientic pursuit.Though he never completed his planned treatise on the subject, da Vincirsquos later anatomical studies mark him out as one of the great scientists of the Renaissance.The exhibition includes some of the finest examples of the artistrsquos anatomical drawings, including The skull sectioned , The fetus in the womband The cardiovascular system and principal organs of a woman .ldquoDrawings of horses abound throughout Leonardorsquos work, including studies for three equestrian monuments that were never realised, said the trust. ldquoThe sculpture that would have been his masterpiece, a monument to Francesco Sforza, the late Duke of Milan, fell victim to the turbulence of politics and warfare that was a constant shadow over Leonardorsquos career.ldquoStudies for the monument, which would have been the largest bronze cast in Western Europe since antiquity, include A design for an equestrian monumentand Studies of a horse .The natural world is explored by da Vinci through detailed landscapes, studies of water and in numerous botanical studies, the finest of which were developed in preparation for the now lost painting Leda and the Swan, including A branched bur-reed .The artistrsquos Leda was the only female nude that he ever painted, and the nakedness of her body was emphasised by her elaborate hairstyle of braids and coils, the focus of the preparatory study The head of Leda .Da Vinci gained a reputation as a skilled map-maker and engineer, and in August  he was appointed military architect and engineer to Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI and Marshal of the Papal Troops.Over the next few months, Leonardo surveyed Borgiarsquos strongholds to the north and east of Florence, and created his most impressive surviving map, A map of Imola .He continued to make maps on histo Florence, several of which were connected with his proposed projects in civil engineering, including a map of the Valdichianaand The Arno valley with the route of a proposed canal .His most famous work is the Mona Lisa, which hangs in the Louvre in Paris.Towards the end of his le, da Vinci left Italy forever and moved to France.His body was failing, and in his late drawings and writings he became obsessed by the subject of a cataclysmic storm overwhelming the Earth and sweeping away all matter.But far from being chaotic, these deluges were drawn and described with the dispassionate eye of a scientist.The most elaborate is A tempest , in which wind gods hurl thunderbolts among dense clouds, while a landslide peels away from the remains of a mountain and falls into the rushing waters below.The exhibition in Edinburgh is the culmination of a year-long nationwide event, which has given the widest-ever UK audience the opportunity to see the work of this unparalleled artist.In February,  of da Vincirsquos drawings from the Royal Collection went on display in  simultaneous exhibitions at museums and galleries across the UK, attracting more than one million visitors.Martin Clayton, head of prints and Drawings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: poundThe drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are both incredibly beautul and the main source of our knowledge of the artist.ldquoAs our year-long celebration of Leonardorsquos

Nor will Parliament ever vote to Revoke Article .Even the  Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who wrote to Brussels urging the EU to agree a deal with Boris Johnson, ended up voting against. Numerous Tory MPs who broadly support the deal, like Ken Clarke, cant get in line. Everyone wants something that they cant have.There will now be further procedural wrangling and wriggling this week, as the Government tries to get another meaningful vote tomorrow and a second reading of the Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday. On paper, the votes should be there,the Tory rebels relent and Labour Brexiteers vote for the deal.But votes alone have never been enough to get Brexit over the line. This affair has now gone beyond politics and turned into a kind of psychological condition. Brexitus Interruptus: a withdrawal method with a beginning but no end."},{"url":null,"title":"delay-no-deal-cliff-edge","story":"What the passage of yesterdayrsquos amendment makes very clear is that it is time for the Prime Minister to request an extension to Article  and take a No Deal Brexit off the table.Parliament has only sat on a handful of Saturdays since the end of WWII. This is an occurrence reserved for the most fraught of circumstance and there is no question that a bid to ram through a devastating Brexit deal with little scrutiny merits such an occasion.Now I am a committed Remainer and I believe that there is no Brexit deal as good as the one currently we have, but there were a number of signicant faults with this deal in particular. First of all, while it might have reduced the risk of medicine shortages after October , it offers no guarantee of a deal in the long run. All it does is move the No Deal clf edge to the end of . All an unscrupulous PM and his hardline allies needs to do is fail to present a Free Trade Agreement to parliament next year, the transition lapses and then we have no deal.The second major reason is the threat that it poses to the integrity of the UK. Last year Ruth Davidson and David Mundell wrote to the Prime Minister that they ldquocould not support any deal that creates a border of any kind in the Irish Sea and undermines the Union, beyond what currently exists. They were right then and nothing has changed since.:People dont trust a word Johnson saysThe case against independence is still strong, but the deal that the Prime Minister proposes risks undermining it. We all know that the SNP will use any issue to build the grievance on which their case is built. This deal risks playing into their hands.Likewise, from their comments in the press and in Parliament, even the DUP were appalled by the way that Northern Ireland was being treated. It is safe to say that Arlene Foster can be added to the list of women who Boris Johnson has lied to and abandoned.Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose Brexit. We know that it would hammer the economy, cost jobs across the country and sell workers down the river.This makes it all the more astonishing that members of the Labour Party are shaping up to back it. These MPs risk throwing away their partyrsquos progressive heritage to vote for a far harder Brexit than the deal negotiated by Theresa May that Parliament rejected. Whatrsquos more, with Corbyn supposed to have promised leave supporting MPs that the whip would not be withdrawn, therersquos more than a hint of tipping the wink going on at the highest level of the Labour Party.:Brexit is now beyond politics, its becoming a psychological condition: Brexitus Interruptus.My colleague Jo Swinson is quite right to demand the Prime Minister obey the law and send a letter asking for an extension to Article . Then, once the extension is secured, I hope that all MPs will think deeply about their constituents and recognise that what we need to do now is take this back to the people."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ensure-vote-takes-places-new-brexit-referendum","story":"And shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer left open the possibility the party could back Boris Johnsonrsquos deala new national poll was attached to it.Sir Keir insisted that any agreement approved by Parliament needed to be put to voters in a referendum and the party would back an amendment calling for one.:Johnson refuses to sign Brexit extension request to EUThe Labour heavyweight told BBCrsquos The Andrew Marr Show: ldquoWe need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through, it should be subject to a referendum.ldquoWe have already voted, I think, three times as a party for a second referendum with a three-line whip behind it.ldquoThe position we have adopted is whatever the outcome, whether itrsquos Boris Johnsonrsquos bad deal or a better one which could be secured, it has got to go to a referendum up against remain.:Scottish court rejects legal challenge over Boris Johnsons Brexit dealAskedLabour could back the Governmentrsquos dealit came with the pledge of a new referendum, Sir Keir said: ldquoWell, wersquoll see what that looks like.ldquoWhat we are trying to achieve is that this deal in particular, but any deal, is put up against Remain in a referendum.ldquoAnd we will have to see tactically how we get there.Sir Keir said Labour would also push for a customs union.He said: ldquoWe have been arguing for a very long time now for a customs union with the EU and for single market alignment."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-raab-uk-government-got-numbers-get-brexit-deal-parliament-october-31","story":"He expressed confidence that Britain would be out of the EU by October  despite Boris Johnson acceding to MPsrsquo command that he formally request from the EU to extend Brexit beyond that date.Insisting the Prime Minister had ldquocomplied with the law, Mr Raab declared: ldquoHe has made clear his view hasnrsquot changed Parliament canrsquot muzzle the PM.

We will have to see tactically how we get there.\"In response, Dominic Raab described the Labour move as ldquoextraordinary. The Foreign Secretary said: ldquoPeople are saying get this done and move on.But Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray, speaking on Sunday Politics Scotland, stressed how a second referendum had \"always been the compromise weve been putting forward\".The Edinburgh South MP also noted how the SNP had ldquogone slightly cold on a Peoples Vote but added, given what it had said in the past, it would support an amendment calling for one.Meanwhile, Sammy Wilson for the DUP suggested his party would not back tagging a second poll onto the Governmentrsquos Brexit deal.\"The DUP does not seek a second referendum, merely implementation of the first,\" declared the Antrim MP."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-shouldnt-need-royals-help-dispel-stereotypes-pakistan","story":"But their Twitter streams were eerily quiet on the subject.

Its MPs voted against the idea in April, but could they now compromise to avoid regulatory checks in the Irish Sea  Some Westminster insiders think so.If Mr Johnson does emerge from this bruising game as a winner and the UK leaves the EU before the end of the year, it appears increasingly likely that his opponents will have signicantly changed the definition of a victory.But what of the spectators  The hundreds of thousands who marched on London at the weekend to demand a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit.Itrsquos an idea that now has the support of  per cent of people in Scotland, compared to only %t who would prefer a General Election ndash with % unsure ndash according to a Panelbase poll published yesterday.The team campaigning for a confirmatory referendum started le in the lower leagues, but has now reached the Premiership. Victory remains a dficult prospect, yet far from impossible.In the indicative votes the proposal fell short by just . Could some of the Tories and former Tories who were previously opposed now be persuaded this is clearly the best way out of this mess  Perhaps.Could the two SNP abstainers, Pete Wishart and Angus MacNeil, join the \"Aye\" lobby  That seems unlikely, with the Nationalist leadership seemingly backing away from full-throated support for a Peoplersquos Vote.But the DUP has said it will examine all amendments.Could its MPs be persuaded that this is a safer option than allowing regulatory ergence to happen  A cup shock certainly, but they do happen.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer yesterday said Labour will this week back an amendment for a confirmatory referendum.Unfortunately for Labour, just as it finally gets its act together on the pitch, victory looks further away than ever.Too much dithering with the ball in months gone by has left it languishing in the polls.And there remains a very real possibility that Mr Johnsonrsquos deal could ultimately pass with the support of a few Labour MPs.Eventhey represent a Leave-voting constituency, anyone in the Labour Party supporting the Prime Ministerrsquos Brexit deal is betraying everything that the party is supposed to stand for.How on earth can they convince themselves to trust Boris Johnson to protect workersrsquo rights If this scenario comes to pass, Labour will be blamed for facilitating Brexit.And itrsquos SNP politicians who will be celebrating. In fact, it could be said this match is rigged: the SNP can win, whatever happens.If Mr Johnson gets his Withdrawal Bill through with the help of Labour votes, the Nationalists will not let anyone in Scotland forget that. It will be a reverse- moment, when the SNP was blamed for ushering in the Thatcher era.Whenever the General Election comes, and it will be soon, the SNP will sweep up.Butthe Tories canrsquot get a deal through, the extension is secured, and an election is called ndash well, the SNP win in Scotland anyway. And not only that, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnsonrsquos likely successes in England will be exactly the away result the SNP thrives upon.The only way the SNP can really lose isBrexit is stopped, taking away the partyrsquos justication for demanding a snap second independence referendum.That might go some way to explaining why neither Nicola Sturgeon nor Ian Blackford mentioned a Peoplersquos Vote in their conference speeches last week, and the SNP has used its Parliamentary amendments to prioritise a General Election instead.First things first though: this morning all eyes are on Jacob Rees-Mogg as he outlines the Governmentrsquos preferred next steps.A reminder that perhaps wersquore all losers in this game."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-take-moral-high-ground-ignore-public-mood-peril","story":"Two major movements showed their lack of this power last week - Extinction Rebellion and the Remain Alliance. These movements share a number of similarities. Firstly, they have both emerged out of a genuine and real problem. Climate change is undeniably a global issue of enormous proportion. And those who are currently dedicating their lives to campaigning on the issue, we must accept, do so from an altruistic starting point. And Brexit, though a far smaller problem, also needs to be fixed and those who wish to fix it by scrapping it are perfectly entitled to devote their time to so doing, with the rest of us also accepting that they are decent people.Their second commonality, though, is where their problems begin. For they are both characterised by a very heavy dosage of moral superiority. Extinction Rebellion protesters are so utterly convinced of their righteousness that they are completely unable to see the validity of any other argument. Even those of us who are personally exercised by the climate change problem and wish to contribute to fixing it in a realistic timescale are castigated by Extinction Rebellion as ruthless capitalists. Similarly, those in the Remain Alliance who wish to scrap Brexit find it almost impossible to see the perspective of someone like me: a Remain voter who believes that democratic legitimacy demands that the biggest democratic exercise in the countryrsquos history is honoured.It is this moral superiority that has led to both movements crossing a threshold this week, which in the final analysis is likely to lead to their emaciation. In both cases, their most hardcore supporters will never accept that any errors have been made, but in their pursuing of the purest form of their argument, both movements are now risking losing the goodwill of the \"silent majority\".In the case of Extinction Rebellion, the removal of a protester from the roof of a tube train by London commuters was a metaphor for a misreading of the public mood. It had, before that, largely escaped the scrutiny it deserves, given that the execution of its net-zero by  policy  would probably involve the end of capitalism, mass unemployment and a global famine. But the disruption of electric mass-transit public transport, as well as making no strategic sense, may represent the peak of the curve for Extinction Rebellion, particularly in a country which is actually making seismic strides to alter its energy production away from coal, towards renewable sources. This could be the point at which the public says: ldquowersquoll find our own way through this, thanks. Or, worse still, the point at which the public association of Extinction Rebellion with climate change sets back the legitimate case for action.And here we arrive at Brexit, again. I voted Remain in , and I donrsquot regret that. I voted Remain for all the reasons that have come to fruition. It was never going to be an amicable orce because the EU was always likely to make it dficult, and, as the Scottish independence referendum has taught us, the UK was always likely to enter a period of deep ision. EU membership was a priority issue for a small proportion of people, and we are here essentially because of an internal schism in the Tory party.The public has since been remarkably patient with politicians. We have allowed them to prolong the process in the hope that we may reach the most sensible outcome possible. We have allowed extensions, and a change of Prime Minister. We are even prepared, polling would suggest, to allow another general election, the third in four years,it would serve a purpose to break the jam. But there comes a time where that silent majority says: ldquothatrsquos it.That time came when Boris Johnson, against the received wisdom, it must be said, came back from Brussels with a new deal. Polling in the immediate aftermath, by YouGov, captured concisely the mood of the nation. Leaving with Johnsonrsquos deal now leads Remain by  per cent. More than one in five Remain voters - yes Remain voters - want to take the deal. And only % of Labour voters - still notionally driving the Remain Alliance - now want to stay.I would suggest that the scale of the Remain Alliancersquos misreading of that public mood on \"Super Saturday\" will only become more evident in the days to come, with polling sentiment on the up for taking the deal, for Johnson himself and for the Tory party.The morally superior always make tactical errors. And out of that moral superiority - that bunker mentality - has emerged this absolute clanger.Actions have consequences. In truth, Remain has overplayed its hand to the degree that this is a win-win for Boris Johnson. The optics of the Remain Alliance, for the umpteenth time trying to thwart Brexit, will do him nothing but good in the tired eyes of the public. Despite that, it seems more likely than not that his deal will make it through the Commons, with a departure from the EU on or very shortly after st October.There is then very little left in the tactical arsenal of the Labour Party or the Remain Alliance to prevent a General Election. And, at that, a General Election in a post-Brexit environment with very little role for, or visible presence of, Nigel Farage. Therersquos only one place for the Brexit Partyrsquos votes to go, and thatrsquos to Boris, complete with barrel-loads of Labour Leave votes in the Midlands, north of England and South Wales.If this all sounds familiar, it is because it would represent the near-precise execution of the Dominic Cummings Boris Johnson strategy from day one. They knew which votes were available to them, they pursued a deal while the media swallowed the narrative to the contrary, and they understood the rewards of a post-Brexit election. Both men, I suspect can put up being called dictators in Parliament and Nazis on a Peoplersquos Vote march. Their eyes have always been on a bigger prize - a landslide.Remainers have blindly danced to their tune all along. We Remainers like to think wersquore very clever, but the Alliance showed all the hallmarks of bunker mentality by failing to understand the public and business mood on Super Saturday.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament-must-accept-deal-britain-get-eu-fta-end-2020-truss-says","story":"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said numerous countries including the US and Japan were keen to secure FTAs with Britain.Read more:Labour set to push for second referendum to be included in Govts Brexit dealldquoOur friends across the Channel have also indicated a desire for a strong trade agreement and there is plenty of time to secure an EU FTA by the end of we leave with this deal on October  without further pointless delay, Ms Truss wrote in The Daily .On Thursday, Ms Trussrsquos Tory colleague Conor Burns gave an update to the Commons on the UKrsquos post-Brexit trade agreements.Mr Burns told MPs: ldquoIn preparation for our exit from the European Union the Government has, to date, secured  continuity trade agreements with  countries.Read more:Scottish judges set to rule on whether Boris Johnson in contempt of court over Brexit lettersldquoTrade with these countries represents  per cent of the UKrsquos total trade.Ms Truss has previously indicated that the UK could have up to  free ports creating ldquothousands of jobs after it leaves the EU.On Monday she wrote that Parliament had a chance to end the lack of clarity about Britainrsquos trade future.ldquoAnd think of where we could be in December we do  she added.Read more:Row over BBC Laura Kuenssberg biased anti-Sturgeon tweetldquoFree trade deals negotiated with the EU and other partners that ensure our future as a high skilled, innovative, free enterprise economy, excelling in tech, data and services and selling our high-quality food around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"kemnay post office set to reopen in 2019","story":"The Kemnay Post Office is set to reopen next month in a new location.The Post Office has announced that the new community branch will be located at the McColl’s shop on Aquithie Road.The new location is just a short walk from the previous Post Office on High Street, which has been temporarily closed since October due to the resignation of the previous Postmaster and the withdrawal of the premises for Post Office use.When the move goes ahead, the branch will open, from am–pm Monday to Saturday and am–pm on Sunday.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amThe Scottish Association for Mental Healthis inviting Orcadians with lived experience of suicide to apply to take part in a new National Suicide Prevention: Lived Experience Panel.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Targeting public transport is ideologically nonsensical but to do it at a time when irritable commuters are trying to make their way across heaving s is akin to having a death wish. Which is not to suggest the way the mob turned against the man standing on top of the train was acceptable merely that it could have been predicted by anyone who has spent time on the London Underground at rush hour.The misjudgment alienated workers who might in other, less volatile circumstances have been interested in a discussion about climate change. But it also allowed those right-wing commentators – the Brendan O’Neills and the Toby Youngs – to build on existing tropes of the campaigners as too middle class, too “elitist” and too extreme. The spectacle of the likes of Times columnist and Brexiteer Iain Martin positioning himself as the defender of “working class cleaners” would be hilariousit wasn’t so depressing. But these labels stick, especiallythe targets are stupid enough to engage in behaviour which perpetuates them. It’s dficult enough to take on governments and global corporations without handing their smirking henchmen the weapons with which to shoot you.Though the Canning Town protest brought matters to a dramatic head, criticism of the movement – its lack of a coherent ideology or strategy, its insensitivity to race and class issues its “the end of the world is nigh” catastrophising – have been a source of internal and external friction for a while.Extinction Rebellionhas been influenced by political scientist Erica Chenoweth who says . per cent of a population must take part in a campaign of civil disobedience to guarantee political change. In order to attract that . per cent, the movement has to be inclusive. However,you embrace a large cross-section – rich and poor, young and old, people from all ethnicities and political perspectives – it’s unrealistic to expect their views on causes, priorities or tactics to be aligned.There are many obvious fault lines in XR. There is the ide between those in the global north – where we are being urged to “think of the children” – and the global south, where the poorest are already directly being impacted by floods. There is a ide between those who can afford to pay a carbon tax on flights and those for whom it might mean the loss of their once-a-year package holiday.And then there is the ide between left and right between those anti-capitalists who would once have been in Occupy and “Malthusians” – like Rupert Read – who want to rein in large-scale immigration. The extent to which this obliviousness to potential “othering” has the capacity to damage XR can be seen in the furore over the flowers left for the police officers at Brixton Police station. It takes a gag-inducing dollop of white privilege not to associate Brixton Police station with the oppression of black communities or to understand that praising officers for their “decency and professionalism” might be considered offensive.The kind of climate change deniers who tweeted: “Please not Greta Thunberg” on the day the Nobel Peace Prize was due to be announced have already branded XR a Doomsday Cult. I would argue you can’t be a Doomsday “cultist” when the Doomsday scenario is rooted in science. But again XR sometimes behaves in a way that encourages this interpretation. It doesn’t help that co-founder Gail Bradbrook’s world view altered after she took mind-bending drugs on a retreat in Costa Rica. Nor that some of those involved are so Biblical in their presentation of future destruction. When Bradbrook declares  per cent of species will be dead within her daughter’s letime unless we all stop producing CO by , she sounds more like a wild-eyed prophet than a credible campaigner.This matters a lot. If the complaint about climate change deniers is they ignore science, then XR has to be rigorous in sticking to the facts. It should base its statements on demonstrable truths – the destruction of our coral reefs, rising sea water levels, plummeting insect numbers. And its demands should be realistic. If it is feasible to ask the UK to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by , fair enough, Butit is not – and many experts believe it isn’t – then they should focus on what can be achieved. Pushing for too much, too quickly is only going to wind up potential sympathisers.Talking of winding people up, XR leaders should use the tube station disaster as “a learning opportunity”. Civil disobedience is an important tool. It can raise awareness. It can force the hands of governments. But the targets have to be carefully chosen. Not the London underground. Or the BBC which – despite sometimes giving climate change deniers a  – devotes time to reporting the impact of extreme weather conditions.Those organising the protests ought to be mindful of workers’ routines and a balance ought to be struck between causing enough of a disturbance to make an impact and so great a disturbance it threatens livelihoods. And use some imagination. If you want to target public transport, don’t bring it to a standstill, forcing more people to use their cars make some statement about its cost or inefficiency. Alongside the civil disobedience, the movement would gain from demonstrating some grasp of the complexity of climate change: the way it intersects with capitalism and class and how –we do not guard against it – the solutions may entrench inequality rather than reverse it.Extinction Rebellion is right in principle. Climate change is the most important issue of our time. The consequences of not acting quickly enough will be seismic. It is not true, as Thunberg has implied, that governments are doing nothing but they are not doing nearly enough.To force them to change their ways requires a massive, but also a measured response. Martin Luther King – the inspiration behind much of XR’s thinking – orchestrated bus boycotts and marches. But he retained enough establishment respect to be accepted into the White House to talk to JFK and Lyndon B Johnson at least until the Civil Rights Act was signed into law. At the moment, the movement is making le easy for those naysayers who criticise XR’s tactics not because they have better ones, but because they want to push climate change off the agenda.If Extinction Rebellion wants to be taken seriously, it needs to be less scatter-gun. It needs to rein in its renegades and rid itself of racists who see those in the global south as “the problem” rather than as victims of colonialism. Saving the world is a lofty aim, but it won’t be achieved by alienating all those whose co-operation is neededthings are to change. It will be done by creating a consensus by persuading as many people as possible that radical, systemic change is not just desirable, but imperative.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch snp must back labour s brexit vote plan","story":"Keir Starmer#s is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and Sturgeon should follow, writes Lesley Riddoch.Never mind the provocative bluster from Boris Johnson’s hollow frontmen and women, there is no disguising the signicance of the Tories’ weekend defeat. Of course, many predict rebel Conservatives will nowto the fold, able to support the Johnson deal since the Letwin amendment ensures it cannot be “accidentally” dropped, talked out or stalled before  October. But Tory Remainers will soon face another testing option – putting the withdrawal deal to the people in a second Deal v Remain European referendum. It looks increasingly that this is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and the option’s current traction owes a lot to the growing status of Keir Starmer.: Ian Blackford: Boris Johnson not treating office of PM with any respectThe shadow Brexit secretary followed an impressive Commons speech on Saturday with a categorical assurance on yesterday’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour will back an amendment calling for a referendum on Johnson’s Brexit deal, perhaps as early as tomorrow. No s or buts. No self-defeating subclauses or bizarre contradictions. : MSPs on course to back laws for quickfire Scottish independence voteClear, comprehensible and conclusive. Hardly Labour-like at all.And bold, leaving Britain open to the great risk of a second Leave vote – a result that would then be impossible to sidestep or deny. A game-changer But the plan has just as big an upside – it’s as bold as the disruptive and eye-catching strategy of one Boris Johnson.Could this be the game-changer that finally unites the opposition around a single Remain plan  Will Jeremy Corbyn back a colleague who’s widely and openly being touted as the next leader of the Labour Party  And will the SNP follow suit  Strangely enough – even on the fractious left – the answer to both questions could finally be yes.The stock of Starmer, former director of public prosecutions, has been rising quietly throughout the Brexit debacle but his Commons speech on “super Saturday” was as succinct and punchy as Corbyn contributions are generally “nuanced” and stumbling.Historian Simon Schama tweeted: “Keir Starmer has actually READ the proposed agreement in crucial detail and thought deeply and forensically about it – and then argues responsibly from that detail. Brilliant, but makes everyone WISH he were leader.”Such open praise and longing for change at the top would be enough to send a younger rival packing,Labour had a petty, self-opinionated leader. But while Corbyn may have many faults, personal envy doesn’t seem to be one of them. Indeed Starmer’s success actually reflects very well on the man who appointed him. As one supporter tweeted: “Corbyn runs a team, takes a backseat when needed and lets his star members shine. Other leaders demand the spotlight, refuse to delegate and fail. It’s no coincidence he’s seen out two Tory PMs.”Jeremy CorbynBut is the Brexit-leaning Labour leader smart enough to back Starmer instead of overriding him  A second referendum call has the benefit of being a relatively quick manoeuvre, not requiring a Labour election win, and helpfully separating the party from its own crazy plan to renegotiate Brexit but then campaign against its own new deal in a second referendum. Supporting Johnson’s deal would placate Brexit supporters and the “just get it over with” brigade, while also delighting Remain voters with the possibility that the attached second vote might dump Brexit altogether.Indeed the only thing wrong with Starmer’s second referendum plan is that it opens Labour up to the accusation of being feart – failing to propose a vote of no confidence and a general election, even though the next EU extension will certainly end the danger of a no-deal Brexit. So will Corbyn back a confirmatory referendum on Johnson’s deal  He might,other parties back the move. It’s rumoured high-profile Tories such as Amber Rudd now accept there’s no other way to break the deadlock. Will she and other rebels openly back a second referenduma suitably neutral backbencher champions the cause  Starmer even hopes to coax the DUP on board. Good luck with that. But what about the most important block of votes – the SNP. Is it ready to play ball Backing the wrong horseSpeaking on Sunday Politics Scotland, Ian Blackford wouldn’t commit the SNP to following Labour’s lead and talked instead of another court case or a vote of no confidence. It seems a strangely wooden response to a fluid situation and leaving the SNP in danger of backing the wrong horse tomorrow. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that the path to a second vote will be rockier than anyone appreciates. Certainly,the amendment passes, it’s not clear how a second vote will be organised. Can Johnson really be expected to produce a fair, timeous, workable referendum he doesn’t want to hold  The childish, churlish clutch of letters sent to the EU this weekend shows how grudging he can be. That’s why many MPs believe a “government of national unity”is the only way to deliver a second vote that resolves the Brexit process once and for all. SNP MP Joanna Cherry believes such a scenario is the best chance of winning a Section  order – which would allow the Scottish Parliament to hold a legally binding second independence referendum – not just because the SNP would be in a bargaining position but also because democrats from other parties would find it hard to deny the inconsistency in their current second vote positions.Of course, the SNP may worry that a confirmatory referendum on Brexit sets a dficult precedent for indyref. It might, but we are where we are – perhaps about to find a democratic solution for a stalemate which might otherwise hand the next general election to Johnson on a plate. It’s also hoped the end of the Union will be more of a “conscious uncoupling” than a Brexit-style bust-up. Talks with opposition MPs in Scotland and London have been progressing quietly, aided by joint working over Brexit. Starting the indyref project in a collaborative, non-confrontational way allows the slender hope that constitutional change in Scotland will not be conducted with the high-handedness of the Conservatives’ Brexit.So all eyes will be on the backbenches tomorrow.If a well respected figure allows Labour to push for a second vote, and the SNP, Liberal Democrats and some Tory rebels follow suit, Britain’s constitutional logjam could be released far more quickly than anyone imagines. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

A similar vote was effectively pulled on Saturday after MPs backed an amendment, brought by ex-Conservative grandee Sir Oliver Letwin, to prevent the UK crashing out of Europe without a deal. : MSPs on course to back laws for quickfire Scottish independence voteThis forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to write to Brussels seeking an extension beyond  October, which he had previously pledged not to do. But he refused to sign the correspondence, which was accompanied by another signed letter from the Tory leader to European Council president Donald Tusk warning he believed a further extension would be “deeply corrosive”.: Brexit: Johnson facing Scots court case over “dual” Brexit letters‘We have the numbers’Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab yesterday insisted the government has the numbers to get its legislation passed. Sir Oliver, along with former home secretary Amber Rudd, have said they would now back the withdrawal legislation after backing the Letwin amendment. “We seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons,” Mr Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday. “Why hasn’t Parliament pushed this through  That’s what we’re going to do next week.”He added: “The advantage of the deal is that it deals with some of the legitimate concerns about a no-deal Brexit. Oliver Letwin has said, and he was one of the authors of the motions on Saturday, he’s said he will now vote for a deal.“I think a lot of people think, ‘Get this done’. We’ve got a deal. People have written the Prime Minister off. He’s confounded the doubters.” Mr Raab said soundings with other MPs appeared to indicate a narrow majority for the deal.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, insisted that the UK would still be leaving the EU at the end of the month as scheduled.“We are going to leave by October st,” he told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge show yesterday. “We have the means and the ability to do so and people ... yesterday we had some people who voted for delay, voted explicitly to try to frustrate this process and to drag it out.“I think actually the mood in the country is clear and the Prime Minister’s determination is absolute and I am with him in this. We must leave by October st.”Mr Johnson had been legally required to send the letter, but stressed to Brussels he was sending it only at Parliament’s bidding.Mr Gove claimed the parliamentary defeat had increased the risk of a no-deal Brexit and he was “triggering” Operation Yellowhammer – the government’s plan to deal with such a scenario.He said: “The risk of leaving without a deal has actually increased because we cannot guarantee that the European Council will grant an extension. And that is why I will, later today, be chairing a Cabinet committee meeting, extraordinarily on a Sunday, in order to ensure that the next stage of our exit preparations and our preparedness for no-deal is accelerated.“It means that we are triggering Operation Yellowhammer. It means that we are preparing to ensure that,no extension is granted, we have done everything possible in order to prepare to leave without a deal.”The Letwin amendmentThe Letwin amendment effectively prevents the UK leaving without a deal. The country could still leavethe deal struck by Mr Johnson last week with EU leaders is endorsed by MPs by the end of the month.Sir Oliver described his amendment as an insurance policy and insisted he would now be backing the government’s deal.“I am absolutely behind the government now as long as they continue with this Bill, continue with the deal. I will support it, I will vote for it,” he said.Ms Rudd, who quit the Tory whip, said she too would back Mr Johnson’s deal.“I support the Prime Minister’s deal and I have told him I will support it next week,” she said. Ms Rudd insisted there was a “fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it. It is a very fragile coalition to support the Prime Minister’s deal.”Although the government may have the numbers to win a straight vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, it is likely to face amendments on ­contentious issues such as a customs union, single ­market access and a second referendum which may thwart the process.Labour said it would push for a new EU referendum when the government brings its Brexit plans to the Commons.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused Mr Johnson of “behaving a bit like a spoilt brat” in the way he had communicated with Brussels over the extension request.Mr McDonnell said another meaningful vote on the deal today would be “pointless” and a “political stunt” and advocated instead for the “real parliamentary process of scrutinising that legislation”.He added: “We need the Bill before us, like we would consider any other Bill... we’re saying bring it back next week and let’s consider it. Do you know, he might even meet the deadline of the st Octoberwe go through a proper parliamentary process ”LabourAskedLabour could back the Brexit deal, Mr McDonnell said: “When the Bill comes forward, what we’ll try to do, as in the normal way, [is] put amendments to that Bill and see whether or not we can ensure that it meets the criteria that we’ve set out.“The problem that we’ve got is this has become quite a fundamental choice about the future of our economy. “Do we want to go down the Boris Johnson proposals of erging from our major trading partner and deregulating our economy, undermining workers’ rights, consumer and environment rights  No, we don’t.“So what we’ll try and do is, of course, try and amend that legislation and seewe can get agreement in Parliament.”Askedthe EU was going to be open to an extension, its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said European Council president Donald Tusk would consider the next stage.He said: “As foreseen, the EU ambassadors meet this morning to take the next steps of the [EU] ratication and tomorrow I will await the European Parliament.”He added: “It was a very short and normal meeting of EU  ambassadors to launch the next steps of the [EU] ratication of the agreement.”Finnish prime minister Antti Rinne, whose country holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said yesterday “it makes sense to allow extra time”.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government.

Typically dark , with intricate patterns, thebird is dficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. However, once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous.One of those who had the opportunity to view the bird last week was RSPB site manager, Brad Robson.He said: “It really is a fantastic bird. It sits on branches during the day and then at night it flies about hunting insects.“To see a Common Nighthawk is very rare indeed in fact it is the first one recorded in Northern Ireland. There have been sightings in Ireland on just a couple of occasions.”Its appearance in Ballymena has generated huge interest with bird watchers coming over from the UK to see it.Brad went on to explain that the bird is likely to have ended up in Ballymena due to the recent Storm Lorenzo.He said: “The Common Nighthawk breeds across North America and then they migrate to warmer parts of South America.“During that migration some will fly out over the coast. However, when you get these big powerful weather systems which you see across the Atlantic at this time of year some of those birds can get caught up in the storms. They are then whisked off across the Atlantic and one of their first landing stops can be Ireland.“When a bird is travelling in a weather system it cannot feed so the faster the weather system is across the Atlantic the more chance of it surviving the journey. Some birds will often rest on ships, however, that is unlikely to be the case with this bird.”Brad said that whilst the sighting in Ballymena is “very rare” the storm did bring a some American birds to Europe, causing a lot of excitement among bird watchers.He added: “It was great to see the Common Nighthawk flying about hoovering up the insects and I think everyone there was pleased to be able to see it so easily.”According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The common nighthawk measures . to . inches long and displays a wing span of to  inches. During migration, common nighthawks may travel , to , kilometres . According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North Americas longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies, Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda, finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America, primarily Argentina.

Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin.

I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Government to allow MPs to have a “meaningful vote” on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal as the Prime Minister fights to fend off new threats to his plans..pushAll eyes are on the Commons Speaker as he decides whether to allow the vote to take place on Monday amid concerns that he may reject it because of parliamentary rules.Mr Johnson is also facing a court challenge over his extension request and Labour attempts to secure a customs union and a fresh referendum.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson speaks in the House of Commons In his latest Commons defeat, Mr Johnson abandoned plans for a meaningful vote on Saturday when MPs backed a move forcing him to ask Brussels for a further delay.But because the deal had been debated, there are concerns that Mr Bercow could block a vote coming back so soon because of rules over the same matter being discussed twice.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak denied that trying to bring the deal back for a vote was a bid to portray Parliament as being obstructive.“It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“I think people are crying out to see that and they would find it odd , because of some technical procedural device, we weren’t able to have that vote.”If the Speaker does block the move, focus will switch to the Government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Billbefore MPs on Monday, with a vote on its second reading on Tuesday.The WAB is the legally-binding treaty that must be passed for the UK to leave the bloc, while the Government must also win a meaningful vote.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called on MPs to “respect the referendum” by backing the Bill, warning them: “This is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on October .”Ministers insist they could have sufficient support among MPs to get it passed so the UK can depart by the current October  deadline.But, with no Commons majority, Mr Johnson faces a major battle to achieve his cast-iron pledge.We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public servicesShadow health secretary Jonathan AshworthLabour has denied it is trying to scupper the PM’s agreement by planning to amend it to secure a customs union and a second referendum as the legislation passes through Parliament.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Today: “We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public services.“We believe that the responsible way in which to leave the European Union is in a customs union arrangement and that, in turn, should be put to the British people so they can have a say on this.”Meanwhile, judges are set to decide whether the unsigned letter sent by the PM asking for a Brexit extension from the EU complied with the Benn Act, orhe is in contempt of court.Mr Johnson was forced to send the letter under the law passed by MPs trying to fend off a no-deal Brexit because MPs did not support his deal by the Saturday deadline.But he signed a second letter and said a delay would be a mistake and judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh are to resume a hearing on Monday.The letters were sent after former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin handed Mr Johnson an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.Sir Oliver, who was among the rebels exiled by Mr Johnson over their attempts to stop a no-deal, successfully tabled an amendment which effectively forced the PM to ask for a delay.As Parliament demanded in the Benn Act, Mr Johnson wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the end of January.The PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be “deeply corrosive” for the UK and the EU.Labour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a “spoiled brat”."},{"url":null,"title":"exceptional

Mr Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs, but the damage gave a boost to the Conservative Party led by Andrew Scheer.No party is expected to get a majority of Parliament’s  seats, so a shaky alliance may be needed to pass legislation.Scheer has been hostage to the message. His campaign has made him into an attack machineIf Conservatives should win the most seats – but not a majority – they would probably try to form a government with the backing of Quebec’s separatist Bloc Quebecois party.Mr Trudeau’s Liberals would likely rely on the New Democrats to stay in power.Mr Scheer is a career politician described by those in his own party as bland, a possible antidote for those tired of Mr Trudeau’s flash. Mr Scheer, , calls Mr Trudeau a phony who can not even recall how many times he has worn blackface.Jason Kenney, Alberta’s premier and a close friend of Mr Scheer, calls the Conservative leader “an extremely normal Canadian” who is so nice he “can’t fake being mean”.Mr Scheer, however, has so relentlessly attacked Mr Trudeau that Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster, said he has not been himself.“Scheer has been hostage to the message,” Mr Nanos said. “His campaign has made him into an attack machine.”Conservative supporters chanted “Lock him up! Lock him up!” at a rally on Saturday after Mr Scheer said he would investigate Mr Trudeau’s attorney general scandal – mirroring the Hillary Clinton “Lock her up!” chant popular at Donald Trump rallies.Mr Scheer moved to calm the crowd and changed the chant to “Vote him out.”Mr Trudeau embraced immigration at a time when the US and other countries are closing their doors, and he legalised cannabis nationwide.His efforts to strike a balance on the environment and the economy have been criticised by both the right and left.He brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta’s oil to international markets.He also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the US and Mexico amid threats by President Donald Trump to scrap it.Mr Scheer is promising to end the carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by  per cent.“That money belongs to you, not to them,” Mr Scheer said."},{"url":null,"title":"broomsticks ready spellbinding halloween fun foyleside shopping centre","story":"Feeling frightful about what to do this Halloween  Fear not, as Foyleside Shopping Centre has plenty of spellbinding family activities to keep you spooked from this Saturday th right through to the st October.To be sure to terry the whole family – there will be an array of ghoulish Halloween games, chilling treasure hunts and “‘”trick or treat’” challenges to sink your vampire teeth into.Or you can unleash your inner beast by mucking in for the monster soft clay workshop.Why not quench your bloodthirst with chocolate apple and pumpkin decorating  Oryou’d rather rise from the dead for the occasion, visit our professional Halloween makeover and face painting stalls!

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix. Neil Curran ran a great race, going out hard and hanging on mdash a tactic which worked extremely well. He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17944401.children-get-back-nature-convention-share/resources/images/10559872.jpg","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I bunked off afternoon games to go to the huge anti agreement rally at City Hall..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Some of the rally I remember clearly, such as being close to the s corner building with a clock, opposite Robinson and Cleaver, at the corner of Donegall Square North and Donegall Place, where the crowd was crammed in a way that today would spark safety fears. For some reason I recall a middle aged woman in the packed crowd wearing a DUP , ,  sticker.The concept of giving Dublin a say in NI at a time when it was perceived to be doing little to stop a long terrorist campaign, was easy even for a teenager to understand.Yet I have only fully come to grasp the AIA’s signicance decades later, both the long-term intentions of the signatories, UK Ireland, and its impact.It also took a while to see what its signing said about the preceding failures of unionist leaders, and what the response to the AIA said about loyalism’s declining power.Not infrequently in  we report on developments that have their origins in , such as the recent episode in which the Taoiseach visited Hillsborough Castle without being hosted by a Secretary of State, days after the NIO advisor, Lord Caine, who had always insisted on such accompaniment, was not kept on his post.Despite the inappropriate circumstances of his visit, Leo Varadkar then used British state property to publicly attack a UK government that was not there to defend itself.As is the enduring pattern of NIO and British weakness in the face of such relentless Irish partisanship, London stayed politely silent in response to this subtle over reach.A well connected Westminster figure tells me that unionism, whatever its present dficulties, is in a better position than , when it had few friends in the House of Commons, hence why NI MPs were unaware of the coming Thatcher volte face.Kate Hoey: The Brexit plan ides the UK, so I will not be voting for it todayLord Empey: The Union is not safe in the DUP’s hands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There are now younger Tory MPs who grew up through the Troubles, or older ones who served here, who instinctively view NI as British.Another dference between the AIA and Boris Johnson’s u-turn is that two years ago, in the  backstop, London made clear its determination to avoid an Irish land border, so we have had time to get used to the risk of a sudden, forced Irish Sea one.But even so, there are key similarities with .In both cases, the climbdown was by two Tory prime ministers who had used emphatic language in defence of their full support for Northern Ireland’s undiluted place in the UK .In both cases, the number of Conservative MPs who were prepared to support unionists in defiance of their own prime minister was miniscule. In , a mere  Tory backbenchers rebelled against the AIA, out of Mrs Thatcher’s vast parliamentary reserves of almost  Conservative MPs.Today, we do not know how many Tories will reject the Boris Johnson Brexit plan, but it is expected to , or fewer than that, and not even all of them will do so on the basis of their support for the Union.This does not mean that Conservative MPs in  or today have been disinterested in the Union. To an overwhelming extent, they support it. But, when under pressurethere is only so far they will go to the wire to protect it.Both votes,  and today, also reflect a fundamental truth that no unionist should ever forget: our numerical near insignicance within the United Kingdom.Even the derisory Tory rebellion of  MPs in  is greater in number than there have ever been Northern Ireland unionist MPs, in any one Parliamentary session.Unionists are around .% of the population of the UK, and about .%of the population of the EU.There was only so long that unionist concerns were going to be allowed to hold up the might of Europe in its desire to strike a deal with a major nation state, the UK. But this latest political abandonment of unionists involves a factor that was absent previously: the views of Middle England.Middle England’s view of Northern Ireland has, perhaps mercully, never been put to the test before.It had not been asked whether or not it wants Scotland or Northern Ireland until the Scottish independence referendum of . I was alarmed by polls that showed % of English people wanted Scotland to stay. It was cited to encourage Scots to vote to remain in the UK, but it was in fact quite a lowish level of southern solidarity.Recently there were surveys that found that in a choice between Brexit and the Union, more people in England would choose Brexit.Parliament is sitting today, and last sat on a Saturday in  for the Falklands war. A task force was sent halfway across the world to defend almost uninhabited islands.The Troubles then was ongoing, and had been for  years, and would persist for another decade. Around , British servicemen were killed in the Falklands and NI, yet the UK public never rebelled against that sacrice.Now the population of England, which makes up the great bulk of the UK, and its establishment Tories, seems willing to make constitutional concessions over UK territory, on a scale that was resisted for decades despite relentless violence, all on behalf of a cause — Brexit — that had little traction a few years ago outside a eurosceptic fringe.As to the merits of this deal, I am still trying to absorb it. Respected pro Union voices including Lord Trimble, Ruth Dudley Edwards and the Spectator magazine think it is a good compromise for NI. Perhaps so. But it is a massive turning point in British history that will take decades to assess. I think, overall, it is a bit better than Theresa May’s deal. Yet there is no disguising the fact that soon we are likely to have a major, and probably permanent, internal border in the Irish Sea, something no other nation on earth would allow to ide its territory.Five years ago most unionists would have found that prospect unthinkable and appalling.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Watch what happens today in StormontToday the Stormont Assembly will sit for the first time in two and half years later after it was recalled by MLAs wishing to protest at changes to Northern Irelands abortion laws.

Ordination in Bangor in “I never met him but my father always told me about him.“Then one day in  I was at Queen’s Theological College and he was giving a lecture on medical ethics. I took him aside and thanked him for saving my le.“He went on to become the chair at Queen’s University in gynaecology and obstetrics, a world leader in his field, and also a generous supporter of East Belfast Mission . Man slashed in face and kicked unconscious in savage attack Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Every now and again I’d get a cheque from him to support the homeless work that we were doing with the East Belfast Mission.”Shortly after Jim was born his father brought him to Hilda’s house where their prayers had been answered: “Hilda prayed again that I would be a preacher.“That was never my aspiration. Although I was brought up in a religious background I never saw the possibility of entering the ministry.“I knocked about with fellas who mitched school, I was a bit of a rascal. I left school at  without any qualications whatsoever.”He continued: “My call to the ministry came when I was converted through the Pentecostal church. I met up later with a man called Sydney Callaghan from Dublin who became a very radical minister on the Shankill.“Whatever he had, I felt God was calling me to the ministry through Sydney.“Over a period of years I studied and made it into the ministry.“It’s something I’ve never ever regretted. It’s been a great privilege to be a minister and a pastor and care for people.”Jim worked on the Newtownards Road for  years where he founded the East Belfast Mission in . He was later stationed in Portadown and was involved in mediation to dfuse the impasse at Drumcree.“I’ve been in all sorts of dficult situations,” said Jim, who worked almost exclusively in conflict areas during the Troubles and witnessed some of its most horric events.“I was ministering through the worst of the Troubles and experienced the death and destruction that was happening on all sides.“Some of the stories are quite horric. One of the most memorable tragedies that I experienced was how this young man – he was the goalkeeper for our old boys football team – became friends with the security man who worked at the Iceland store in the Orby area. The security guard was a Catholic, the young man was a Protestant. They were both fans of Manchester United, the security man would have brought him programmes and stuff from Manchester. “One day someone on came past on a bicycle and shot him dead. The young goalkeeper has missed it by a matter of seconds. He was in absolute trauma over all of this. “I went to the parish priest to try to talk it out, the young fella came with me to say to Father Eamonn O’Brien with whom I was very good friends, that he did not want to be associated with this murder. He said the man was his friend.“When the Ormeau Road situation arose I remember a nurse who was part of our congregation, she stayed in the City Hospital in the room of a -year-old boy who had been shot dead. She had to wait until the family came to get the bad news.“That led to me taking her to see a parish priest to allow her to express how traumatic and awful the situation was.“These were people who had real compassion and love and no sense of bigotry. There were people like that all over the place.“I think there were lots of people in east Belfast who wanted to get on with their neighbours but they were frightened, intimidated by paramilitaries. That was true of both the IRA and the UVF and UDA.”Jim interjects: “But that’s not what this book is about. Not much of my experience of the Troubles is in this book because I want it to be an uplting book.“It is essentially a Christian book but it’s not hitting you up the face with the Bible. It’s trying to engage with people about the Christian faith in a way which might make them think.“There’s a lot of people out there who don’t read very much, this book is for them. I want this book to be something that will help people, encourage them, make them think. It’s not a book about me. The stories relate to me but the book is not about me.”He added: “The other aspect to the book is to give honour to some ordinary people, people like Stevie Rutherford who discovered George Best.“History will record that Manchester United scout Bob Bishop discovered George Best, but in the first instance it was Stevie, my old friend who lived beside him in the Cregagh estate.“What I discovered after this book is that Stevie bought George Best his first pair of football boots. It was pointed out to me by his grand niece when she read the story.”Jim was elected president of the Methodist Church in Ireland in , prior to being awarded an MBE in .He is a regular on BBC Radio Ulster’s Thought For The Day and Downtown’s Just A Moment as well as writing a religious column in the News Letter.In  his portrait featured in a ‘Quiet Peacemakers’ art exhibition by Susan Hughes.Jim’s book contains a series of great chapter titles like ‘Albert The Nazi And The Mystery New Testament’ which demand further investigation. It provides much humour, for example in the story of the man who couldn’t reverse his car. Jim said: “His brother used to said to me, ‘I’m going mad about our Jack he’s pulling the car out of the driveway with a rope’.”Jim spoke of one story that didn’t make the book about the importance of generosity “in the now”.He said: “My grandad was a poor man. His watch was probably the most valuable possession he had. I remember he said to me, ‘when I die you’ll get this watch’.“One day I’m sitting in the house with him and he said to me, ‘what’s that watch you’re wearing ’ I took off this old cheap Timex watch and handed it to him. He handed me his watch and said, ‘I’ll take your watch and you have mine’. I resisted, but he said, ‘I want to have the joy of giving it to you now’. “The idea isyou’re prompted to do a generous thing, don’t delay, do it. I’ve given the watch to my son. I’ve found that through le there’s a joy in doing something for a person in the now.”Jim said the original inspiration to write a book came from a former member of his congregation: “Many years ago there was a young woman at a church where I was minister in Co Fermanagh. Many years later she sent me a gt of money and said I should write a book. How she had come to that conclusion I wasn’t sure but she’d probably heard some of my stories in the pulpit.”In his book Jim recounts a Bible story with a twist: “One of my friends Roy, now a Methodist minister, tells a hilarious story of his early days working in Sandy Row in Belfast. In a local primary school he asked the class this question: ‘What is the purpose of the Bible ’“Quickly a wee lad responded, ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘it’s to houl open the windy to help my granny breathe’.“Roy confirms that later he walked down the little street where the wee boy lived, only to see, much to his amazement, a wee Bible propping up the window.“Every time I recall that story I rock with laughter.”Elsewhere in the book Jim tells the story of Harry Toft, a pastor at the Pentecostal Church in Ballysillan, whose father – known as ‘The Human Corkscrew’ – had been a rugby union player in the Swansea team who beat Australia on Boxing Day .As his le came to an end he told his son, ‘I used to think that the greatest moment of my le was the day when we beat Australia, but Harry, I tell you, the greatest day of my le was when I met Jesus Christ’.try catch  TrendingNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooMan shot in both legs in barbaric appointment attackHistoric Belfast Presbyterian church bought by Limerick-based Roman Catholic instituteN.I.

With the influence they claimed to have had at Westminster, Northern Ireland should never have been put in this position,” said Sir Reg.“It was the DUP who cheered Boris Johnson  months ago at their party conference, and it is they who cheered him again three weeks ago at his party conference. What happened on each occasion  Boris threw them under a bus both times.”Mr Wilson, meanwhile, quashed any suggestions the DUP would support a second referendum.“The DUP does not seek a second referendum, merely implementation of the first,” he added.Meanwhile, Robin Swann says the DUP should learn their lesson and learn not to “rely on the word” of Boris Johnson in future.The UUP leader said: “The prime minister has demonstrated that his word is certainly not his bond. If the DUP should learn anything from this debacle, it is that they should never rely on the word of Boris Johnson. They were warned on several occasions. While they were feting Boris Johnson on the national stage, they took their eye off the ball and he mugged them. In doing so the prime minister was able to produce a deal which is hugely damaging to the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.“If the prime minister is in anyway sincere about serving the best interests of all four corners of the United Kingdom he should be engaging all the parties in Northern Ireland.”Tributes to Kingsmills Massacre widow Jean Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooNI man killed in awful incident -

It is a cynical political stunt, which has no prospect of leading to the formation of an Executive, but it will increase acrimony between parties and bring the chamber further into disrepute, making an actual restoration more dficult,” she said.“The intention of this recall is not to block abortion law and equal marriage, but to create the illusion the DUP are trying to do so. “Regardless of our inidual views on abortion, Alliance believes it is not appropriate to treat a serious issue with profound consequences in such a cynical matter and we want nothing to do with such a charade.

We will not be party to such a lie.“Alliance’s MLAs will be in Parliament Buildings on Monday, as they have been every week since the collapse of the institutions. Not only are we available for talks but we demand they start immediately. If those who signed this petition feel so strongly about the formation of an Executive and wish to take decisions, they must take responsibility for reaching a deal to deliver that. We are ready to play our part in forming an Assembly and Executive which is able to effect real change and make progress for everyone in our community.”Sinn Fein has already said it will not be attending Monday’s recall either, branding it a “stunt”.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Labour has denied it is trying to scupper the PMrsquos agreement by planning to amend it to secure a customs union and a second referendum as the legislation passes through Parliament.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told Today: ldquoWe are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public services.ldquoWe believe that the responsible way in which to leave the European Union is in a customs union arrangement and that, in turn, should be put to the British people so they can have a say on this.Meanwhile, judges are set to decide whether the unsigned letter sent by the PM asking for a Brexit extension from the EU complied with the Benn Act, orhe is in contempt of court.Mr Johnson was forced to send the letter under the law passed by MPs trying to fend off a no-deal Brexit because MPs did not support his deal by the Saturday deadline.But he signed a second letter and said a delay would be a mistake and judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh are to resume a hearing on Monday.The letters were sent after former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin handed Mr Johnson an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.Sir Oliver, who was among the rebels exiled by Mr Johnson over their attempts to stop a no-deal, successfully tabled an amendment which effectively forced the PM to ask for a delay.As Parliament demanded in the Benn Act, Mr Johnson wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the end of January.The PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be ldquodeeply corrosive for the UK and the EU.Labour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a ldquospoiled brat..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Commons Speaker facing calls to allow Brexit  umeaningful vote u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related. Local demographics show a dip in child births in the area which has led to this decision. “I feel it is unfair to associate Brexit with this decision,” said the MLA.“The education authority have given

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
