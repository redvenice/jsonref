I think what most people watching or listening to this will question is \u0027\u0027what about my time?\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Those are all amazing things, I would simply love to do them but I don\u0027t have enough time in the day\u0027\u0027. \u0027The distractions of life, whether you\u0027ve got work complications or every element of our life becomes busier and busier and busier. Then add on top of that, the attention economy of media, social media, pulling you in all sorts of different directions as well, again it goes back to everything you said. \u0027Most people will sit there and listen and think that\u0027s fantastic but I don\u0027t have the time. Well the good thing is, you can make time. \u0027And if you don\u0027t have time then you probably need to make time even more. I, similar to you Alexi, experienced burnout and throughout that burnout literally getting to the very end of everything I had. \u0027I was burning the candle at both ends. And just went boom. And that is when you are forced to look inside yourself. Because with everything else around you you feel as though it\u0027s working against you but the only way you can really combat it, the only way you can build resilience for the outside world and your entire environment is the inner work. \u0027Because if you work out how and why you react to certain people, certain situations you can gain control of those situations. Doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not gonna happen, it means that your reaction to them is more in your control.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so profound Harry, and I\u0027m glad you mention this point of time. Could you share a little bit more about what that experience and journey has been like for you and what are some ways you\u0027ve seen success in investing in your mental fitness?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027It has to start from yourself. This idea that you can somehow find mental fitness from other people. Yes, as a team you can certainly encourage each other but it starts at home and it starts internally. \u0027And the effect that has for yourself and reaching your own peak performance but also the people around you and if you\u0027re a business leader then also your employees as well, to go \u0027\u0027you know what everyone\u0027s gonna have today focusing on themselves\u0027\u0027. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that necessarily everyone\u0027s going to take them up on that offer but as I said at the beginning everyone has such busy days anyway that even if you do have that 15 min slate of white space...\u0027By the way I now put in about half an hour or 45 minutes in the morning when it\u0027s like \u0027\u0027okay one of the kids has gone to school the other one\u0027s taking a nap right there\u0027s a break in our programme\u0027\u0027.  \u0027It\u0027s either for workout, to take the dog for a walk - get out in nature. Maybe meditate, I know that I need to mediate every single day. I would hope that everybody would be able to do that but the reality is that once your time starts slipping away and once you have other commitments in your day or you need to be there to show up for other people, guess what, the self care is the first thing that drops away. \u0027And I\u0027m happy to admit that as a husband, dad, someone\u0027s who\u0027s starting up a business but then think about the single dads, single mums you just don\u0027t have the time to be able to do that. \u0027So yes I think the point here is that when it comes to mental fitness it\u0027s the pinnacle, it\u0027s what you\u0027re aiming for and the road towards that can be really bumpy, it\u0027s called inner work for a reason. \u0027And I think that immediately might put some people off. Going \u0027\u0027more work?\u0027\u0027 But the outer work becomes so much easier once you get to grips with the inner work and then everything starts to fall into place.\u0027\u0027Serena Williams: \u0027Do you find that that work that you do on yourself, because you know I\u0027m still learning, is that like an everyday thing or is this like a few times a week? \u0027I know how much nervous system is gonna react to certain situations that are out of my control. What can I do, what have I got in my toolbox that I know works for me? \u0027What is readily available and it\u0027s different for every single person...\u0027You\u0027ve got to put it in like just as much as brushing your teeth every morning it\u0027s got to be straight after something that\u0027s already in your day diary of this is a habit, I need to make it a habit. \u0027If it\u0027s not a habit then it\u0027s the first thing that drops away from your busy day.\u0027 \u0027Life is about learning, right. If you\u0027re in your 20s, your 30s, your 40s and even your 50s and you think that you\u0027ve got it sorted, then bad stuff\u0027s gonna happen. \u0027There\u0027s a lesson here, there\u0027s a lesson. I\u0027m being schooled by the universe. There\u0027s something in this for me to learn so that next time this happens I become more resilient or being able to see a way around it to be able to achieve the ultimate goal. \u0027And if you have that perspective then every single bad thing that happens, actually can be good.\u0027 Mr Robichaux: \u0027You know one reason we\u0027re doing this with companies is around this matter of what we were talking about is we need to reframe inner work as part of the job. Harry I\u0027m curious, what does that bring up to you? You\u0027re building a business, you\u0027re an entrepreneur, how do you think about this?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027From an employer perspective you can\u0027t expect in today\u0027s world your people to put in the work on themselves when you\u0027re not giving them the time to be able to do that. \u0027Which is why I think it\u0027s so important as employers going \u0027\u0027you know what, if you wanna be able to do, if you have the chance to be able to do it in your own spare time, that\u0027s fantastic we fully support you. But we are going to factor that in to your routine at work\u0027\u0027. \u0027If everybody was doing that, the shift in global consciousness and awareness and self awareness would be enormous, would be vast. Again, the proof is in the pudding. \u0027Look at these companies that signed up or that had a BetterUp coaches for the last however many years and the numbers speak for themselves. The employees their potential their performance at work but also at home has increased tenfold in some cases. \u0027So not only are they better at work, therefore as an employer \u0027\u0027you\u0027re welcome, you\u0027re getting more out of me than you thought you would\u0027\u0027 but also you\u0027re creating more capacity and more ability for those iniduals when they go home to show up and be the person they need to be for their friends and their community. \u0027To be the parent they need to be for their kids. So it is one whole cycle of connectivity that ultimately means everybody around you starts to benefit. That\u0027s the way I see it.\u0027Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so well said. What\u0027s your experience been with coaching?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027To have someone there who\u0027s not only coaching you through life but as part of that is challenging your perspective. \u0027That\u0027s what I ask from my BetterUp coach on a weekly basis. I can\u0027t wait for BetterUp to be in that position to be able to make it even more accessible for people so that every single person anywhere around the world had access to a BetterUp coach and you know the biggest challenge we\u0027re gonna have is finding enough coaches. \u0027Because the demand is there, the need is there. The need\u0027s not gonna go away guys, we know that. The world\u0027s becoming harder and harder and more complicated and that\u0027s just an observation. \u0027I think people are gonna need to rely on each other and on professional help but also friends, family, maybe complete strangers. Anyone can actually help you in that coaching process. \u0027To be able to have different points of view in your life and friends who will not worry about pushing back on things that you say or things that you feel to be able to make you, well not make, encourage you to be able to see it more clearly, I view that as trying to surround myself with people who I would happily have washing the windscreen and clearing those filters so that you can be able to see your own life and the reality of that life more clearly rather than this endless filter system of what you think is happening.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I love this conversation about coaching. Before we wrap is there any final advice or coaching you would share in relation to practicing mental fitness or investing in inner work?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027Life is about discovery. In that discovery you\u0027re gonna find things that you don\u0027t like, that make you uncomfortable. \u0027You\u0027re gonna find things that are constantly pushing back on you but as you work your way around those things, all of a sudden all of the stresses and chaos and all the things that were working against you in your life. \u0027Be it private life, work life, whatever it is that work life balance, all of the things getting in your way either fall away or you visualise them and are able to turn a negative into a positive and therefore make those things work for you.\u0027And when you get to that point, from my perspective is feels like a superpower, but it takes time. It\u0027s constant, it\u0027s a work in progress. \u0027For me personally it\u0027s like constantly buffering. It\u0027s a work in progress, some days are great some days are really hard. \u0027And no matter what I put into it I am always kicking myself going \u0027\u0027if you\u0027d done this this this which you know works for you, then you wouldn\u0027t be in this state now\u0027\u0027. \u0027So again it\u0027s work but out of all the work we do and all the things we work towards, it is the most fulfilling work apart from being a dad.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Does Vitamin D work Covid Israeli study finds nutrient big indicator severity","story":"Share this articlePre-infection 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and association with severity of COVID-19 illnessIsraeli study offers strongest proof yet of vitamin D\u0027s power to fight COVID | The Times of Israel"},{"url":null,"title":"Well wishers welcome HMS Prince Wales Portsmouth","story":"Share this article In May 2020, the Royal Navy launched an investigation after a pipe leaked on HMS Prince of Wales and caused an ankle-high flood.The leak was said to have taken place on the carrier while it was at Portsmouth Naval Base.A video later posted on Facebook showed water gushing through the ceiling and flooding an entire room of the warship.It is understood that the pipe was isolated quickly and the water was soon mopped up by the crew on board.The Royal Navy later said it was testing its safety systems including the deployment of life rafts and emergency chutes following the flood.A Royal Navy spokesman said at the time: \u0027Following a minor issue with an internal system on HMS Prince of Wales, the ship\u0027s company were required to remove a small volume of water from the ship.\u0027An investigation into the cause is now under way but this will not affect the ship\u0027s programme.\u0027Then, in December that year another leak occurred, with a Royal Navy spokesman saying: \u0027HMS Prince of Wales is alongside at HMNB Portsmouth conducting repairs following a flood in an engine room.\u0027The ship\u0027s company are getting ready to sail for further training and trials in 2021.\u0027More than 100 sailors were forced to leave the ship and spend the night on HMS Queen Elizabeth after the aircraft carrier suffered a power cut in Portsmouth harbour in 2019.HMS Prince of Wales is scheduled to spend a period at its home base in Portsmouth before departing again next month to take part in an international exercise off Norway.HMS Prince of Wales: NATO command ship teams with RAF Odiham Chinooks for joint exercises - HampshireLiveRoyal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales stands \u0027ready to respond\u0027 to Russia as she takes takes command of Nato task force | The News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc17cf4d4354d2ba3601277e47741b6a039a10b/0_359_7773_4663/master/7773.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=88b9f9a69bb574ea0abb31ae5fbe1c86","title":"manchester city v fulham and more fa cup fourth round clockwatch live","story":"And all this on the 50th anniversary of one of the great upsets. “Happy Ronnie Radford day,” said a tweet this morning from Richard Whitehead, whose book The Cup comes out next month and looks like a winner.

He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"dup withdrawal from first minister post very damaging to politics martin","story":"NI First Minister Paul Givan has resigned from Stormont’s powersharing Executive. It follows the DUP’s ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland protocol, which led Agriculture Minister, Edwin Poots, to order a ban on post-Brexit checks at ports.Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Photograph: Liam McBurneyEPA The Taoiseach on Friday night strongly criticised the DUP’s decision to resign from the post of First Minister in Northern Ireland, which he said was “very damaging to politics itself and to people’s trust in politics”. He also criticised comments on Friday by DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson that cast doubt over whether the DUP would go back into government after an election if issues in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol were not addressed. “If the protocol issues are not resolved by the time of the election, then of course it is difficult for us to form a government because of the instability that the protocol creates,” Mr Donaldson told the BBC. “No one party should use language like ‘unless we are fully satisfied we will not be participating’,” Taoiseach Micheál Martin said. Speaking to reporters in Dublin, he emphasised his support for the North’s political institutions and said people wanted them to work. “No one party should have a veto over whether an Executive exists or continues on, and likewise the Assembly.”He said negotiations on the protocol were continuing between the EU and the UK and progress had been made. “The conclusion of those should have been awaited in my view by the DUP.”The Northern Ireland protocol is a part of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement guaranteeing a special post-Brexit trading status for the North in order to avoid a hard Border in Ireland. DUP campaignThe DUP First Minister, Paul Givan, announced his resignation on Thursday as part of his party’s campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol. As a consequence of the move, the Deputy First Minister, Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, also ceased to hold office. Ministers now cannot sit in the Northern Ireland Executive and the Executive is unable to take significant policy decisions.It has also thrown doubt over whether an official apology to the victims of historical institutional abuse, which was due to be delivered by the First and Deputy First Ministers next month, can now take place. The leaders of the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP and Alliance met virtually on Friday to discuss how to speed up the progress of almost 30 outstanding Bills which are currently making their way through the Assembly. They agreed the party whips will meet to continue the work next week. An Assembly election is due to take place in the North in May, but the DUP and Sinn Féin have called for an earlier poll. Asked by The  if the Northern Ireland Secretary was minded to bring the election date forward, a British government spokesman said “our immediate priority is to restore political stability in Northern Ireland at the earliest possible moment”. Order blockedMeanwhile, a High Court judge in Belfast on Friday blocked the order given by the North’s Minister for Agriculture, the DUP’s Edwin Poots, earlier this week to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland’s ports. Mr Justice Colton issued an interim order suspending Mr Poots’s direction following two separate applications for judicial reviews – by an unidentified member of Sinn Féin and another inidual – into the decision. He confirmed that inspections on the agrifood goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain must continue pending the outcome of the legal challenges, which are expected to be heard next month. “There shouldn’t be any doubt or confusion hanging over those civil servants who have to comply with the law,” the judge said.“I propose to make an order, suspending the order or instruction given by the Minister for Agriculture until further order of this court or completion of these proceedings.” Additional reporting: PA"},{"url":null,"title":"lower income households may be targeted in cost of living package","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government believes there will be scope within the State’s finances to help people with lower incomes in particular. Photograph: Laura HuttonMeasures targeted at less-well-off households may supplement wider energy credits as part of the Government’s cost-of-living package, due to be signed off later this month. The Green Party is understood to favour that the package should include elements more narrowly targeted at lower-income households – and on Friday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government believes there will be scope within the State’s finances to help people with lower incomes in particular. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is thought to favour an increased energy credit above the €100 already agreed, so all households benefit, alongside a more targeted measure for those most at risk of fuel poverty. The Fine Gael leader is believed to harbour concerns about the logistical difficulties of identifying and excluding people on higher incomes from a broad-brush higher electricity credit, which is anticipated to form part of the package. However, the cost of wider energy credits, if they were put in place, could limit the room for manoeuvre on other measures. Doubling the planned €100 credit would bring the total cost to more than €400 million, which is more than the Christmas bonus, an expenditure measure so significant that it is considered only at budget time. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath previously sought to engineer the already-planned electricity credit so that better-off people could opt out of receiving the €100 credit for all consumers. However, that element of the plan was shelved after the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities advised that it couldn’t be done due the systems being used to administer the payment. Mr McGrath is also thought to be open to targeting some measures towards working families. Amid widespread speculation about the scope and scale of the cost-of-living package, coalition sources cautioned against inflating expectations, saying that while a package would be agreed, it would not be a giveaway, and that many of the mooted changes circulated late this week would not go ahead. Cabinet subcommitteeMr Martin yesterday ruled out a mini-budget to respond to the rising cost of living, but declined to offer specifics on the Government’s plans to help people counter high inflation and energy costs. The Cabinet subcommittee on economic recovery, chaired by the Tánaiste, will meet next Thursday to discuss options being worked on by line Ministers.A memo for decision by the Cabinet is expected before the end of the month. Speaking on Friday, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the Government “recognises that the cost of energy has increased considerably, and we know that the cost of living has gone up, and we’re going to sit down and look at different ways of how we can support people”. Mr Martin said there were targeted measures to help people in October’s budget and “there won’t be a mini-budget or anything like that but we are looking at further ways that we could perhaps ease the situation for people”.Asked where funding for other measures would come from, the Taoiseach said the fiscal situation is improving all of the time and pointed to tax returns from January that saw “quite high” increases in VAT and income tax receipts. “We have targets and I think we’ll reach our fiscal target by the end of the year but within that we believe there will be some flexibilities to enable us to help people, particularly those on lower incomes who are more affected by the inflationary cycle.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord and just like that golfgate is brought to a swift and sudden end","story":"Is that it?Eighteen months of “Golfgate” madness dismissed in four minutes by a no-nonsense judge in a Galway courtroom.Donie Cassidy, Noel Grealish and hoteliers John and James Sweeney must have been as surprised as everyone else at the speed with which the verdict was produced. As day three of holding forth in never-ending circles around the banqueting tables of a golf society dinner drew to a close, most observers expected proceedings to spill over into another day.Senator Michael McDowell SC had just completed an excruciatingly long closing argument (at one point we noted two people asleep in his vicinity) explaining why his client, TD Noel Grealish, had absolutely no case to answer.There were three other senior counsel ready and waiting to do the same.And then suddenly, after months and months of fury and fulmination and acres of newsprint and countless hours of angry back-and-forth across the airwaves, Judge Mary Fahy dismissed the case against Grealish in a few pithy sentences.“Absolutely no evidence to show he was one of the organisers” of the infamous Golfgate dinner in Connemara. “This is a criminal prosecution. I have a reasonable doubt.”It’s a pity judges don’t bang gavels in Irish courts because this would have been the perfect time for some legal percussion. Perhaps they’ll have a gavel in the movie.“So I have to dismiss the charges.”But she wasn’t finished yet.There would be no impassioned closing addresses from Colm Smyth, Eddie Walsh and Constance Cassidy, and all three of them imported at considerable expense from the Inner Bar in Dublin. There would be no grand stand to make on behalf of their clients, because Mary Fahy was in no mood to hang around. She had heard enough.“We have to admit – anyone listening to the case – that the evidence was most impressive,” she declared, singling out witnesses John Flaherty, former captain of the guard in Leinster House, and none other than Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe as being particularly impressive.“Responsible people” who wouldn’t have gone to a dinner if they didn’t feel comfortable or safe.Judge Fahy had no doubt that the defendants did everything they thought they could do to comply with the Covid restrictions.“And in my view they did comply – not in the court of public opinion but in the court of law, in my view, they did.”This was only going one way.“So I am dismissing the charges against all the defendants.”There were no cheers. No high-fiving.Misty-eyedNoel Grealish, who was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, was the first politician to emerge. He looked a little flushed and misty-eyed as he stood beside his solicitor and let him do the talking. His lawyer and Oireachtas colleague McDowell, who had just triumphantly talked the case to a conclusion, was beaming.Donie Cassidy (75), who had taken the whole episode very badly, was last to leave the courthouse, flanked by the members of the Westmeath legal massive who handled his case: his senior counsel Colm Smyth, junior counsel and former Labour TD Willie Penrose and solicitor JJ Mannion.In some ways, and after hearing three days of evidence, there was a certain inevitability to this whole sorry saga ending with an emotional Donie standing on the courthouse steps in the drizzle, quoting the words of his late, beloved mother: “The truth always wins in the end.”You knew he was upset because he forgot to thank the Minister for Justice for the use of the hall.A weight was gone off his shoulders and he was mightily relieved, but the strain was etched on his face as he remembered all the people who were lost to Covid and the “friends who lost their position in life” as a result of the controversy.Should he have held the dinner at all? “In hindsight, everyone would do something maybe differently.”A few hours earlier, he was in bits with worry.“What do you think? I don’t know what to think. The last two years, oh, I couldn’t begin to tell ya. There was no talking to them. No talking to them . . . How do you think it will go?”Donie the defendant, disconsolate at lunchtime and thinking he was facing into a fourth day in court. For somebody who had been living with the aftermath of the “Golfgate” furore for 18 months, he still seemed shocked by it all.ConsideredAfter the charges were dismissed, questions were asked about whether he should have organised the dinner. The Westmeath legal massive was having none of it as former Senator Cassidy considered his reply.“The court has ruled,” they muttered behind him. “The court has ruled.” And then they gently nudged their client towards the car.All the talk, all the legal argument forgotten in the shock delivery of the verdicts.Eoghan Cole BL, who argued the case for the DPP and the State, looked disconsolate as he left the building. He had put forward a spirited fight against a star team of legal big guns (and a Supreme Court judge who attended the golf beano giving the benefit of his wisdom on the matter from the witness box). And superb he was too, noted the judge on Thursday.Inspector Peter Conlon – he was the main Garda witness – was given a torrid time in the witness box. He stuck to his view that sticking a temporary partition wall down a room of over 80 people to ide them into two legally acceptable groups did not mean they were attending separate events, or in different rooms.“It’s my assertion that it is one room by virtue of two openings made in the partition,” he said in reply to Eddie Walsh’s cultured bellowing.There were discussions on what constitutes a multiple gathering and what is the definition of an organiser. Does a moveable partition make a moveable feast? How big a gap in the partition is acceptable? Is there a difference between mingling and intermingling? Why did nearly all the witnesses seem to be seated with their backs to the action?What exactly is a “three-shot fourball single stableford Champagne scramble competition”? Inspector Conlon was able to explain that to the court. Guards like playing golf. Barristers like boasting that they know nothing about it, as they did again on Thursday.MeanderingFor all his meandering, McDowell made some excellent points in his closing argument. Not least on the intriguing question of “someone in Dublin”, maybe in the DPP’s office, keen to prosecute some of the main movers in the golf outing because of the public outcry over it?“Doubtless somebody somewhere in Dublin decided that there was a public interest in showing the public that heads would roll . . . Doubtless somebody did that in order to assuage public opinion and anger.”This anger was compounded by people “thinking that 80 people had assembled in secret, more or less, abusing their status as members of the Oireachtas” in contravention of the rules. “That was the source of all that anger and recrimination and all the disastrous consequences that followed.”He reminded the court of the atmosphere at the time.The country nearly melted down with anger, quivered McDowell.It didn’t sound like a great night anyway. Former minister Dara Calleary, who had to resign over his attendance at the function, told how he was escorted to a table and told to stay there unless he needed to go to the toilet.After the decision, some of the victorious lawyers gathered in the opulent bar of the Hardiman Hotel on Eyre Square to have a celebratory drink, watch the six o’clock news and toast the partition.Is this the end of Golfgate?The ranks of The Vindicated may now be seeking reinstatement. RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke has already expressed a desire “to be back on air”. Big Phil Hogan will be like a Cheshire Cat. And Dara Calleary will be eyeing a ministerial return when the next reshuffle happens.As for everyone else, you’ll have to ask all the people who cancelled weddings and other events at the time. If they had known they could have had all their guests in attendance if only they had thought of getting partitions. They won’t be too happy, even if they did the right thing.Judge Fahy may have closed her case, but the court of public opinion is still in session."},{"url":null,"title":"south africa hails covid milestone as vaccine factory set for fit out","story":"The NantSA facility, the future vaccine manufacturing campus in Brackengate, Cape Town: unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control. Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia The large empty factory on Cape Town’s outskirts did not appear like a game-changer in Africa’s bid to overcome the unequal distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally when unveiled by president Cyril Ramaphosa last month.Devoid of equipment and employees, the building located in the northern suburb of Brackenfell resembled a vacant warehouse rather than a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical production facility, which it will become by the end of 2022.Yet South Africa’s president assured reporters its development was “a milestone” in Africa’s ambitious drive to improve vaccine equity for its 54 countries, as it aims to make – from start to finish – second-generation Covid-19 shots for distribution across the continent by the end of this year.South Africa’s leader has been highly critical of the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to date, saying poorer nations are last in line while rich ones get preferential treatment from vaccine producers.Official World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics show that only about 8 per cent of Africa’s 1.3 billion population had been vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of 2021, while many developed nations have inoculated more than 60 per cent of theirs.This has prompted many healthcare experts to warn that unless there is more equity in vaccination distribution, it could take years to inoculate enough Africans to bring the pandemic under control in a region where the current dominant Covid-19 variant – Omicron – was first identified. A billion dosesFive African nations have full, albeit small, vaccine manufacturing capabilities, according to the WHO. Other vaccine facilities across the continent primarily carry out a “fill and finish” role – meaning they load and package vaccines developed and mixed elsewhere. South Africa’s new vaccine production plant, which is being developed by the US-based biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, aims to address this situation.Born and raised in South Africa, Soon-Shiong has established the company NantSA to work with the newly-launched Africa’s Access to Advanced Healthcare Coalition to produce a billion doses a year of his Covid-19 vaccine by 2025 in Brackenfell.The doctor-turned-entrepreneur’s new T-cell vaccine for Covid-19, which is being developed by his US-based company ImmunityBio Inc, is undergoing clinical trials in South Africa, Botswana, Australia and the US.There are high hopes for it, Soon-Shiong said at the Brackenfell launch, as it is designed to not only target the virus’s spike protein, like mRNA vaccines do. It also activates “killer” T-cells, a type of white blood cell that is an essential part of the immune system, to attack a nucleocapsid protein at the virus core that is crucial to its structural integrity.“An infected cell is the factory for Covid and killing these cells is the only way to get rid of this pandemic,” he said, adding: “We have developed this T-cell vaccine and we want to manufacture it in Africa, for Africa and export it to the world.”Knowledge transferThe goal is to use the ImmunityBio vaccine as a universal booster shot if it is approved by regulators in the US, EU and other countries, Soon-Shiong said.Last May, Soon-Shiong also committed an initial three billion rand (€175 million) to help facilitate the knowledge-transfer process and local capacity building in South Africa around the T-cell vaccine for Covid.Furthermore, ImmunityBio in collaboration with NantSA will provide the technology and expertise needed to manufacture this vaccine and others, as well as their ingredients. The production plant also aims to develop treatments for cancer, tuberculosis and HIVAids in the coming years.Safura Abdool Karim, a South African public health lawyer, believes that once the Brackenfell plant is up and running, it holds great potential to develop Africa’s pharmaceutical sector.“Building the capacity of local scientists is at this project’s core, so it bodes well for developing expertise here and facilitating vaccine equity for Africans. But the challenge is we are not privy to the nature of the technology and intellectual property transfer, so we will have to wait and see,” she said.However, Abdool Karim maintained Africa still faces a massive challenge in the next six to 12 months to get sufficient Covid-19 vaccines for its people.“Vaccine producers and developed countries need to provide more Covid-19 shots to Africa than they currently are. Vaccines are often shipped here close to their expiry dates even though they need to have at least a six-week shelf life.“They are also sent to African countries on very short notice with little detail of their storage needs provided in advance. So, although rich countries are not monopolising Covid-19 vaccines as much anymore, their approach to sharing with Africa still has the same effect,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mind control elon musks next move looking human volunteers","story":"At first glance, it seems like the right candidate needs only a range of standard office skills: “Effective multitasking” “great verbal and written communication” “attention to detail”. But then the requirements become rather more demanding: “Understanding of Class III implantable neuromodulation devices.” Not everyone, it is clear, will have what it takes to work for Elon Musk.For this is a job ad just posted by Musk’s five year-old company, Neuralink. And not just any job ad. This is not one of the usual tech openings for software engineers, or digital designers dreaming up products of the future. This is a job ad for a clinical trial director – for someone, in other words, to run tests on living humans of a product that’s ready for surgical insertion now.In a way, it should come as no surprise. Other job vacancies at Neuralink – animal care specialist licensed veterinary technician – testify to the progress of experiments on monkeys. But that should not detract from the import of the moment. For though it is not as well known as Tesla and SpaceX, Musk’s more celebrated electric car and rocket ventures, Neuralink is, if anything, even more ambitious, aiming to develop a device, known as a brain machine interface (BMI), that will ultimately plug our grey matter directly into the connected, digital world, allowing us to control devices, tap global knowledge, and even communicate with each other, purely with our thoughts.No wonder that under the job ad’s heading “What we offer”, the very first line reads: “An opportunity to change the world.”Of course, playing with the brain – shocking it, switching it, slicing or dicing it – has been entrenched in medical mythology since Mary Shelley dreamed up Dr Frankenstein and his monster almost exactly two centuries ago. Even the idea of permanently inserted devices in the brain is not wholly new. For a quarter of a century, a company called Medtronic has been implanting deep brain stimulators into patients with Parkinson\u0027s disease to prevent tremors. But those are like pacemakers for the brain, therapeutic devices keeping its signals steady.Today, however, a new breed of technologist, including Musk, dreams not of jolting the brain, but of merging it with our computer world, and so potentially allowing not just the sick to be healed, but also driving an astonishing augmentation of humanity’s powers of cognition and communication. And if human trials go well, they will be a giant leap closer to making it come true.Doing so would mark a profound breakthrough, for scientists have been trying to connect brains to computers for more than 50 years. In 1969, year of the Apollo mission, a young German-born neuroscientist called Eberhard Fetz pulled off his own moonshot by wiring a single neuron in a monkey’s brain to a machine that fed the animal a treat if the neuron fired. Within two minutes, the monkey had grasped the process and was triggering the machine at will to tuck in, just by thinking. This century, implants have been used to help paralysed patients moved prostheses like robot arms with their thoughts alone.But the kit can be clunky: the process of ‘reading’ the electrical signals in our brains inaccurate ‘decoding’ them hard and relaying them to whatever object we want to control, slow.The 1982 thriller Firefox, starring Clint Eastwood, showed what might be possible. In that film, that object of thought control was a Soviet fighter jet which could be flown with the mind alone. According to leading researchers today, the film fired imaginations not just in the cinema audience, but in the US Army, too.In 2018, for example, Nissan announced a prototype with brain-to-vehicle technology, in which a car could tap directly into the driver’s brain and act on signals to brake before the neuron message had reached the foot on the pedal. Nor did the military give up on such split-second advantages in communication. One researcher working on a BMI designed to capture words a person was merely thinking has described being approached by an officer from the US Army Research Office interested in creating a helmet which could silently beam unspoken thoughts from soldier to soldier on the battlefield.Yet as the decades passed, the private sector – turned off by the idea of risky procedures to implant unproven technology in healthy people – remained wary. Funding was limited. Ambitious start-ups repeatedly went bust. But then, in 2016, Musk founded Neuralink, and everything seemed to change.His company’s BMI is far sleeker than the standard existing equipment, known as a Utah array, which consists of spiky silicon pads inserted surgically inside the skull, which read brain signals and feed them into sockets resting on top of the head, from where cables run them to computers that decode them.Neuralink’s device, by contrast, is near enough invisible, with 64 super-thin wires, each with 16 electrodes attached to 1,024 specific neurons inside the head, detecting their activity, then decoding them in a computer less than the size of a 2p coin, hidden under the skin, with the thought commands broadcast wirelessly.You can watch the result for yourself, in a YouTube video that Neuralink posted last April of a rhesus monkey called Pager drinking banana milkshake while playing the classic arcade game Pong using thought control. That topped a 2020 demo in which a pig called Gertrude had been the star.By then, Facebook had joined the party, announcing in 2017 that it too was working on a device that could read thoughts and turn them into sentences for “sharing” at the rate of a 100 words a minute. The difference was that it would do so without drilling into anyone’s head, instead using a wearable skullcap. The project was led by Regina Dugan, a former boss at Darpa the military agency also has ties to Neuralink, helping to fund a surgical “sewing machine” device that Musk’s company plans to use to stitch its array of wires into the brain.Increasingly, though, it is venture capitalists, not men and women in uniform, who are providing the financial backing to drive BMIs. “Because Elon Musk was ready to put in $100m of his own money, a lot of people in the venture capital world were willing to follow in his footsteps,” says Schwartz. Many bet against Tesla and regret it now, having missed one of the most profitable investments of the century. As a result, says Professor Krishna Shenoy, professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, BMIs now enjoy “nearly infinite resources”.Hundreds of millions have poured into the sector in the last year alone. It seems that a tipping point has been reached.The majority of BMI projects remain for therapeutic purposes – to restore sight to the blind by feeding signals from a camera directly to the brain, to give speech to those without by reading their thoughts and broadcasting them, or to help the paralysed interact with the world again for themselves, by moving robotic prosthetics or computer cursors with their mind alone. For Nathan Copeland, who was paralysed after a car accident, and who has collaborated with Schwartz’s colleagues, the BMI is like a mouse, which allows him to draw using computer software, or play video games. As such games become ever more immersive, the ability to interact with them provides paralysed people with real opportunities to escape their condition, if only virtually.But Musk has repeatedly claimed an even higher purpose for Neuralink – the aim of elevating man’s abilities by fusing with the computer world. In this vision, BMIs will allow us to compete with super-intelligent robots, which in future might otherwise destroy us. The company’s mission statement? “If you can’t beat them, join them.”The biggest risk, however, may be that reality does not meet the hype, at least at the wilder speculation. Facebook ended up shelving its headset project (if only to focus on another, wrist-worn brain-reading device). And while the gadgetry gets cooler and more slimmer and more marketable, some of the fundamental neuroscience remains just really, really hard.“There’s an engineering arrogance, they feel they can do just about anything given the right technology,” says Schwartz. He says Neuralink’s team is focused on making its device sleek and small. “And I think they can do a beautiful job with that. But that’s the easy part. The hard part is understanding the signals in the brain, interpreting what they mean.”But decoding complex thoughts, or merging with the internet, “is way off”, says Schwartz. “It remains in the realm of science fiction.” For which there will surely be some, recalling the way Shelley’s Frankenstein turned out, who will be profoundly grateful.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queens platinum jubilee time reflect importance gratitude","story":"Seventy years ago on Sunday, King George VI died. His daughter thus became Queen Elizabeth II. She still is, having reigned for 14 more years than the entire life of her father.In what turned out to be his last Christmas broadcast, a few weeks earlier, George spoke of living “in an age which is often hard and cruel”. But he said he took comfort that “among all the blessings which we count today, the chief one is that we are a friendly people … I wonder if we realise just how precious this spirit of friendliness and kindness is”. His celebration of those virtues and his anxiety that they are undervalued struck the right note for a constitutional monarch. They still do.There is much to be said against hereditary forms of rule, but we all know, from our own families, how important heredity is. Indeed, we now know this in much more scientific detail than we did 70 years ago, because of the advance of genetics. In trying to understand ourselves, we must think of our parents.Perhaps the key to understanding the present Queen is that she has thought about her parents deeply, and especially – in performing her duties as monarch – of her father. That wisdom is in her blood but has also been cultivated in her mind for little short of a century. She had the luck to have good parents, and the sense to make the best of that goodness. Now is the moment to thank her for that.Although we say “thank you” scores of times a day, largely unthinking, gratitude is in fact a difficult emotion to sustain.It can feel a burden, a limit on our own autonomy, a debt hanging over us which we cannot quite be bothered to repay. Hence the joke, “Why does he hate me? I never did him a favour.” One great cynic – possibly Robert Walpole, our first prime minister – defined gratitude as “a lively sense of favours to come”, a bet placed on a future win.Real gratitude, however, is the acknowledgment of what other people mean to us, often felt most strongly after they have died. “I wish she was still here so I could thank her for x,” we say of someone we loved. The Queen is still alive and well, but she will be 96 in April. It is completely the right instinct not to wait, but to thank her now, as will happen, at the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.A campaign announced today and backed by a wide range of groups and prominent iniduals wants the Sunday of these Jubilee days to be particularly dedicated to thanking the Queen and everyone who gives service to the country. The campaign also calls for what it calls an annual “Thank Holiday” (which would be a bank holiday too) to institutionalise such gratitude. An ingenious accompanying report by PWC purports to prove there would be little dent made in gross domestic product by this extra day off.Critics may jib at the idea of saying “thank you” being made semi-compulsory, and joke that we will have only 364 days left each year to be ungrateful. But my sense is that an annual pause to think and thank might be worth it. Gratitude, after all, is a muscle of the mind that needs exercise.Personally, I always have cause to be grateful to W F “Bill” Deedes, the late former editor of this paper and, in his final years, a columnist much loved by the readers. He gave me my first job here more than 40 years ago, and consistently showed, especially to the young, those qualities of kindness and friendliness which George VI extolled.Bill once told me that his favourite prayer was the General Thanksgiving in the Book of Common Prayer, addressed to the “Father of all mercies”. It sees all of the congregation, however exalted in worldly terms, as “thine unworthy servants”, giving God “most humble and hearty thanks for all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men”.It asks God to give us “that due sense of all thy mercies, that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives by giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days”.A tall order, as are most prayers but for Bill it captured his own sense – common in soldiers who fought in the Second World War – that he had survived through no merit of his own, so that every new day was a gift. Like George VI, he counted the blessings. Interesting that the prayer speaks of being “unfeignedly thankful”: its author must have witnessed plenty of feigning.The point is that only if you can be humble enough to give thanks can you also give service. “Thank you” is not a message to be hoarded, but to be passed from person to person. In his humorous, oblique way, this is what Bill Deedes was always doing. We young journalists used to laugh sometimes at Bill’s extreme dislike of confrontation, but I can now see more clearly that he was playing a long game.You cannot, perhaps, work in Fleet Street for more than 70 years (that was his amazing record) and still “walk in holiness and righteousness” all your days, but if you consistently thank people for the good they do, you achieve much more than if you merely castigate them for the bad.In the case of a monarchy like ours, this way of proceeding is the main principle of action, a form of power so soft that if it is exceeded, it quickly fails. The Queen seems to have understood this right from the first, deriving from her lack of ego. An old friend who has known her all her life recalls the period of several months between her accession and her coronation in 1952: “I was always struck by the way she referred to THE Coronation, never MY. As though she just happened by chance to be the incumbent of the position. She had, and still has, great modesty.”That modest self-perception was factually correct, since the Queen’s lifelong role is due to “accident of birth” (plus her uncle’s abdication) rather than to merit. But how many other people have ever existed who, flattered every day for more than 90 years, have been able to maintain that sense of reality so steadily? The Queen must truly believe that she is an “unworthy servant” – not in any abject sense of personal guilt, but as a fact of fallen human nature, a constant incentive to be worthier and so serve better.We know that Princess Elizabeth saw this quality in her father. When he became King unexpectedly and when he headed his country in war, he suffered in bodily health and mental strain. He was well qualified for constitutional monarchy precisely because he never wanted the job yet never evaded the duty.For this, one might guess, as Queen she feels reason to thank him every day, because he taught her what she needed to know. And because of her faith, the model she always holds before her is not only that of her father the King, but also of her Father in Heaven.Hers is a life that has always given thanks. For that she deserves thanks in her turn.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrities have given boost british farmers","story":"Only a fool would try and forecast what venture, property or thing bored celebrities will try, en masse, to purchase next. The bingo card from the past two decades looks utterly chaotic. Massive English country houses, anyone? Small, pathetic-looking dogs? Adopted children from the developing world? And that’s just Madonna.If anybody had “fully working farms with machinery, crops, livestock and agricultural advisers” as a prediction, though, I’d eat my flat cap. Yet, for some reason, that is where we are in early 2022: from DJs to television presenters, actors to musicians, the rich and famous are shunning the glitz and glamour and returning to the soil, hoe in hand, ready to till and sow for our benefit.Sort of. A few are giving it a go. Jeremy Clarkson and his 1,000 acres in Oxfordshire – fertile ground for his hit Amazon Prime series, if nothing else – is just the start. Now, the BBC has a series about the former Emmerdale actor and Strictly Come Dancing winner, Kelvin Fletcher, taking on 120 acres in the Peaks.There will soon be another new BBC series, this time featuring chef Marcus Wareing learning the ropes on his 65-acre smallholding in East Sussex. One episode includes an almost like-for-like reconstruction of a scene from Clarkson’s Farm, as Wareing struggles to control a tractor while under the supervision of an impressively patient local.Martin Clunes has a farm in Dorset. Paul O’Grady still has his farm in Kent. Jimi Mistry and Flavia Cacace, who met on Strictly in 2010, have a farm in North Devon. Matt Baker farmed in Hertfordshire, now he runs his family farm in County Durham. JB Gill, from the boy band JLS, farms turkeys in Sevenoaks. Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner bought a farm in rural Portugal in lockdown.And those are only the British D-listers. Around the world, Oprah Winfrey, Russell Crowe, Reese Witherspoon, Amanda Seyfried, Zayn Malik, Chris Pratt, Martha Stewart and Yolanda Hadid all own working farms. And this week, the British superstar DJ Calvin Harris joined them, swapping his Hollywood lifestyle for 138 acres in Ibiza, where he is, we are reliably told, not afraid to get his “hands dirty”.Reportedly now Ibiza’s largest organic farmer, Harris, who is worth around £200m, employs farmers, chefs and growers to help him produce veg, eggs, wine and farm-to-table meals. To prove he is serious about the venture, he has grown a beard and bought several fleeces.Against the challenges of cheap food culture, a lack of industry newcomers, rapacious housing developers and myriad other issues, farming has long yearned for a saviour from its seemingly inexorable decline. Celebrities, meanwhile, have long yearned for something – anything, literally anything – they can be perceived as saving.But whether the marriage is a mutually beneficial one isn’t always obvious. Generally, one farmer tells me, “it depends if they actually farm it, or if they just use it as their playground”. This is a fair point: buying an existing farm and filling it with a veg garden, a couple of pet alpacas and 50 set-aside acres to rag a quad bike around with your old stag-do mates does little to help the struggling agricultural industry.Actually try and make a go of it, though, and hire an agricultural adviser or some help, and it could do. Better still, make a go of it and simultaneously launch a phenomenally successful TV series that is both entertaining and gently educational about the realities of land management, like Clarkson has done, and you could do farming a world of good.Those were the remarks last year of James Rebanks, perhaps Britain’s most famous farmer, thanks to his best-selling books about life as an upland sheep farmer in Cumbria. It was a broadside against the BBC, but also a tacit endorsement of celebrity intervention in agriculture – assuming the celebrity is realistic about it. (Famously, Clarkson says he made £140 profit from his farm, Diddly Squat, in 2020.)The total number of separate UK farm holdings declined by 35 per cent to just over 185,000 between 2005 and 2016, according to Eurostat. The average age of a farmer sits squarely around 60. Celebrities – even Instagram influencers, despite filtering out much of the toil – might help the idea become a little more appealing to newcomers.The UK’s biggest inidual farmer is arguably the billionaire Sir James Dyson, who has hoovered (sorry, vacuumed…) approximately 36,000 acres in recent years. I visited his high-tech Lincolnshire place with him once he was passionate and fascinated with it all, but in his designer chinos and trademark round spectacles, he looked a little like a tourist.Inadvertent saviours boosting an industry in dire need of support, then, or rich, tax-evading farm blockers making it harder than ever for our country economies to survive? If we know anything about celebrities, the answer doesn’t matter. They’ll be buying something else soon, anyway.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dame helen mirren responds utterly legitimate criticism role","story":"Dame Helen Mirren has broken her silence after outcry over her casting as Golda Meir by questioning whether this means Jewish actors cannot play non-Jewish roles. The Academy award-winning actress was criticised for accepting the lead role in the upcoming biopic about Israel\u0027s first female prime minister due to the fact that she is not Jewish.Fellow actress, Dame Maureen Lipman, said last month that “ethnicity should be prioritised” in the casting for Golda, directed by Guy Nattiv, because the “ethnicity or gender of the character drives the role”. Dame Helen responded to the criticism on Friday night and told the Daily Mail that the question of her appropriateness for the role had occurred to her too, prior to accepting it.The 76-year-old told the newspaper that there was a discussion to be had about the suitability of certain actors for certain roles.It was certainly a question that I had, before I accepted the role. (Meir) is a very important person in Israeli history, she said.I said, \u0027Look Guy, I\u0027m not Jewish, and if you want to think about that, and decide to go in a different direction, no hard feelings. I will absolutely understand\u0027.However, she also added that this approach to casting raises other questions too, saying: You know, if someone who\u0027s not Jewish can\u0027t play Jewish, does someone who\u0027s Jewish play someone who\u0027s not Jewish?Dame Maureen has previously claimed that the challenge of acting was to become the character you are playing regardless of background.But Speaking on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she said that actors who shared the background of their character should be looked at first.On the portrayal of Meir specifically she highlighted that the Jewishness of the character is so integral and added that if the religion fires the character, then actors from that religious group should be considered first.Responding to Dame Maureen\u0027s criticism, Mirren said: \u0027I do believe it is a discussion that has to be had - it\u0027s utterly legitimate.I very much respect Maureen. And I love her as an actress, absolutely.I\u0027d love to bump into her and sit and have a cup of tea and talk about it,\u0027 she added. Dame to dame, I suggest.She added: \u0027My only real fear is if I\u0027m really bad as Golda...in which case, I\u0027ll be toast.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"englands catholic churches scrapping confirmations latin pope","story":"Catholic churches in England have begun scrapping Latin confirmation services amid Pope Francis’s drive to modernise the church.For Christians, the three separate sacraments, or rites of initiations into the Church, are: baptism, confirmation and holy communion.Following a diktat from Rome, English bishops are now cancelling scores of Old Rite confirmations in favour of the simpler reformed liturgies.The new guidelines, published last month, ban ordinations and confirmations in the unreformed liturgy and severely restrict other sacraments. The Pope has issued warnings about the tendency of neo-traditionalism among younger clergy, telling fellow Jesuits in Africa in 2019: “Have you never seen young priests all stiff in black cassocks and hats in the shape of the planet Saturn on their heads? Behind all the rigid clericalism there are serious problems.”These new guidelines will prevent a priest from offering sacraments in the old rite without permission.As a result, churches in England are cancelling their Latin confirmation services. Joseph Shaw, chairman of the Latin Mass Society, told The : “They’re not stopping it because it\u0027s not popular, they\u0027re stopping it because it is popular and that worries them - because it’s not what they’re used to.“They’ve spent their lives using the reformed liturgy, and essentially have devoted their lives to pushing a mistake. That’s a painful thing to admit. Young people like traditional mass, it has perennial value and a more classic style.”Latin Mass is a Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in ecclesiastical Latin. While the liturgy is in Latin, sermons are permitted in the local vernacular.Preparations for around 20 confirmations in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite were scheduled to take place at the Birmingham Oratory in February and more than 40 were expected to be conferred at St James’ Church, Spanish Place, London, in June.However, all of them have been cancelled after the Responsa ad dubia, published in December by the Congregation for Divine Worship, which suggested that Old Rite liturgies were impermissible.The crackdown by the Vatican was intended to halt possible isions within the Church following the growing popularity of the Old Rite - particularly among young people and families, with one senior official claiming devotion to the Latin Mass had become a movement that was “out of control”.However, priests who continue to offer Mass in both the Ordinary and Extraordinary Forms said the move has alienated many of the faithful, leaving them “bewildered and flummoxed” and failing to grasp why they were being punished.“Everybody is very disappointed,” one priest told the Catholic Herald. “People can’t understand it. It is a monumental failure of not listening and not caring. This seems to be just a slap in the face.”“Pope Benedict achieved peace in this area,” he continued, “but now war has been declared and nobody quite understands why.”A spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops\u0027 Conference of England and Wales, said: “Pope Francis is presiding over a reform in the broadest sense. This reform is examining every area of administration and practice.“Traditionis Custodes and any Responses attendant to it are the context of the thirty-sixth of thirty-seven specific ‘motu proprios’ promulgated during this papacy so far. They reform the universal law of the Church.“These ‘motu proprios’ cover any number of subjects in the life of the Church, including matters affecting the Sacred Liturgy.“Liturgical celebrations in Latin are not the issue. Sacraments celebrated by bishops, priests and deacons are to be celebrated according to normative law, using the liturgical books of Pope St Paul VI and Pope St John Paul II.”More from NewsChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfire\u0026#39We never thought war would touch us\u0026#39: On Ukraine\u0026#39s border with Belarus as the tanks and missiles keep arrivingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tesco open first healthy food only store junk food advertising","story":"Tesco is set to open its first store with only healthy food products available, and is also rolling out under 100 calories sections across multiple shops in a bid to crack down on fattening diets. The supermarket giant has begun rolling out dedicated bays for low-calorie versions of crisps, biscuits and other items ahead of a legal ban on promotions of foods high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) later this year.The retailer will this month also open a smaller local branch in Southport which will be entirely HFSS-compliant.Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u0027s has launched a similar initiative across a swathe of its stores, with promotional bays removed completely from aisle ends.It comes as Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, insisted that the Government remains absolutely committed to banning junk food deals, after Boris Johnson told MPs he would look again at the measure.Photographs emerged on social media this week of new aisles at a Tesco supermarket in Leicester stocked with healthier options from suppliers such as Hula Hoops and Haribo, as well as Kellogg’s and Nestle cereals.Many of these have been brought under the HFSS threshold over recent years.Fizzy drink brands also appeared to be absent from the ends of drink aisles - normally a prime location for promotions - which instead were stocking lower-sugar drinks such as coconut water as well as some fruit juices.The move has been welcomed by obesity campaigners, and comes after years of criticism that the layout of supermarkets is sometimes designed to encourage unhealthy purchases.They said the success of the initiative would depend significantly on the clarity of the signage.Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at Shopfloor Insights, said he expected Tesco to follow up by introducing HFSS-compliant bays to their chilled and frozen sections in the coming weeks.He said that the changes meant customers would initially find the layout of stores unfamiliar, with items like toilet roll, kitchen towel and cleaning products at aisle ends where previously there would have been crisps.The first batch of HFSS legislation covering in-store and online promotions is set to come into force in October.Conservative peers alongside food industry and advertising bosses have recently called for the pre-9pm watershed ban for HFSS advertisements, due to come into force next January, to be put back by a year, arguing that the industry needs more time to prepare.The Prime Minister embraced the measures in 2020 after he nearly died from Covid, a virus which is more likely to kill people who are overweight.However, he has promised to listen to more backbenchers critical of the plans as part of his effort to shore up support among Tory backbenchers amid the \u0027partygate\u0027 scandal.But on Friday, Mr Javid stood by the plan. It came as the Health Secretary called for a long-term plan to tackle cancer, the risk of which can be significantly increased by poor diets.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: A bit of fat, sugar and salt in our food never did anyone real harm.As far as obesity is concerned, it\u0027s the excessive quantities of all three, plus the calories that go with them, that do the damage.The idea of having aisles whose products, I assume, will sport predominantly green traffic light labels is to be strongly welcomed.In the companies\u0027 larger stores the idea will lose some of its effectiveness if the aisles are not well signposted.A Tesco spokesperson said: We passionately believe that healthy, sustainably produced food should be accessible to everyone – whoever they are, wherever they live, whatever their budget.We welcome the Government’s ongoing focus on obesity and are working closely with them to understand the detail of the new legislation and to make sure we can implement the changes effectively and communicate the changes to customers.This process is ongoing and forms part of our wider strategic approach to healthy and sustainable diets, and the work we are doing to deliver against our health commitments.Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, says: Tesco and Sainsbury’s are experimenting with their store layouts and if customers like the new arrangement, the companies will benefit. I see no point in promoting essentials like toilet paper at the end of the aisle, but that is a matter for them. Either way, there is no need for government coercion.It is preposterous that the state is now dictating where shopkeepers can place their products. When Conservative MPs look back on their time in Government, many of them will wonder why they bothered.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesVan Gogh loses some of his straw hat, as gallery discovers self-portrait was torn by collectorNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfireMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"van gogh loses straw hat gallery discovers self portrait torn","story":"Part of Van Gogh’s Self Portrait with a Straw Hat has been discovered to be missing by a London gallery after it emerged a dealer may have secretly torn the painting to fit it into a frame.The £90 million masterpiece in the Courtauld Gallery is on an unheard of loan from the US, after the Detroit Institute of Art was persuaded to send the self portrait for a landmark exhibition of the Dutch artist’s work.But when the “box office” image arrived in London, having remained unmoved and unexamined on gallery walls in Detroit for the best part of 100 years, experts examining the painting found that part of Van Gogh’s famous hat was missing.Placed alongside another portrait of Van Gogh in his simple straw headwear, conservators became wary when they noticed that the 1887 painting was suspiciously small.Dr Karen Serres, a curator at the Courtauld, told the :  “The work was never loaned but managed to get hold of it.  They have never attempted a proper study. “If you think about it, people come to see Van Gogh - it’s ‘box office’, so it stays on the wall for people to see. But then you never get the chance to study it.“By putting it next to another self-portrait of him in a straw hat, it was noticed that the painting seemed a little small by comparison, and his hat a little truncated.“By studying it, our conservator realised that it actually used to be bigger, and someone has ripped off a section of the portrait at some point.”Tucked into a large frame, the damage to the artwork was not immediately obvious, but experts found that the painting - made on a thin board - was snapped at some point in its history, possibly to fit it into its frame. The damage has cut off the left side of Van Gogh’s hat - on the right hand side of the painting.The city of Detroit bought Self-Portrait with a Straw hat in 1922, when the motor industry was booming, but amid financial difficulties in 2014 officials considered selling off the painting which was then valued at a minimum of £90 million by Christie’s.Held in the Detroit Institute of Art, Dr Serres said experts likely missed the hidden damage due to the popularity of the piece, which remained firmly on the gallery walls for visitors.Dr Serres believes the damage was likely done by an “early collector” before the reputation of Van Gogh made his paintings almost priceless.The painting was given by Van Gogh to his friend and fellow painter Émile Bernard as a gift, before making its way through the hands of French art dealer Ambroise Vollard, collector Bernard Goudchaux, and Armenian art dealer Dikran Khan Kélékian.Van Gogh painted the work in 1887, and it shows him wearing the peasant garb of a blue shirt and simple straw hat - which would also have kept the sun from the eyes of those painting outdoors.The painting forms part of an exhibition of self-portraits at the Courtauld which Van Gogh painted frantically before his death by suicide in 1890. It is the first time in 130 yearsThe Detroit Institute of Arts has been contacted for comment.More from NewsEngland\u0026#39s Catholic churches are scrapping confirmations in Latin as Pope Francis seeks modernisationChildren are being forced to take part in sports competitions via zoomExperts warn of \u0026#39nicotine time-bomb\u0026#39 as children turn to TikTok to illegally buy vapesNato must boost Eastern Europe troops if Russians stay in Belarus, warn BalticsCrime spikes in Bernie Sanders\u0026#39 hometown after police cuts backfire\u0026#39We never thought war would touch us\u0026#39: On Ukraine\u0026#39s border with Belarus as the tanks and missiles keep arrivingMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"i go bed six kids","story":"Exclusive: I go to bed with my six kids to keep warm and weve all been ill for weeksAn innovative double decker bus, brainchild of Sheppey Community Development Forum, was launched in November to offer food support to people in the area. Now, more and more people are turning to itMembers of the Sheppey Support Bus Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsIn the snaking queue for the Sheppey Support Bus people raise their hoods against the wind screaming off the Thames Estuary. Harsh winter sun throws tired under-eye shadows into sharp relief. These folk in Minster-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, are here to ask for help and that’s hard to stomach for many, embarrassing.Chantelle Stroud, , is out of electricity today. The stay-at-home mum of two under-fives and a teenager thankfully has £ on her gas meter due to a cold weather payment, administered when temperatures drop below  degrees.But without electricity, cooking is an issue. She’ll go to her mum’s. Her “big, old house”, a private rental, is “impossible to keep warm” anyway when you eke out gas. “I go to bed at six with the kids to keep warm,” she admits. “We have been ill for weeks and weeks, my eldest since before Christmas, the doctor says she has a problem with her lung. Her bedroom is freezing.” The innovative double decker bus, brainchild of Sheppey Community Development Forum, was launched in November to offer food support - a social supermarket on the lower deck - and fuel poverty support - offices on the upper deck - to the people of this deprived area. Up top sits Stevie Pettitt, a fuel and water adviser for Seashells, a local family charity, whose job is to arrange emergency fuel vouchers, supplied by Fuel Bank Foundation, to people unable to top up their gas and electricity prepayment meters. With an energy price cap rise of % in April announced by Ofgem this week, this is the frontline of Britain’s fuel poverty war.Here, Stevie stares desperation full in the face while multi-millionaire chancellor Rishi Sunak just tells us higher energy prices “are something we will have to adjust to.”He’ll have no idea what that truly means. The people here know full well about ‘adjusting’ following energy hikes last autumn - they are already skipping showers, turning off the gas so they can cook their children’s tea on electric cookers, going to bed early. And yet most say they still have either run out of electricity or gas, or have only a pound or two left. Stevie says: “I feel I am putting a sticking plaster over a gaping wound. It is heartbreaking, you can hear the devastation in their voices saying ‘I’m cold’.  “People will ask for food they don’t need to cook, they wear dressing gowns over their clothes, they make tea in flasks so they don’t use the kettle. “It’s got to the point where this is all I’m doing and nothing .” A commonplace message pings on her phone. It reads: “I’m so sorry to ask, but how many fuel vouchers are people entitled to  I’m really struggling with topping up my gas, we have been wanting to keep the three kiddies warm. I have been advised it will be switched off at am today. Could you help me please ” The limit is theoretically three a year - but Fuel Bank Foundation can’t be strict. Stevie will rush, but can only get her a voucher by tomorrow.  Ofgem’s announcement for most households means an annual bill increase of £ to £, a year. For those using prepayment meters, many in private rentals and social housing, that rise will be £ to £, on average. Sunak has offered a £ loan to families via energy companies, but this will need to be paid back over time. Also £ council tax rebates to those in bands A-D, but the Resolution Foundation has said one in  of the poorest th of families do not live in properties of these bands. This is also not due until October, when experts predict further energy cost rises.  It’s hard to comprehend what this will mean for folk on the bus, of whom all I meet rely on benefits and do not work, either due to ill-health, caring responsibilities, or struggle to find employment. The vouchers are worth £, originally designed to last ten days on average, but now barely scrape a week for many. From mid-November Stevie’s given out .

Fuel Bank Foundation has  centres across Britain handing out around  vouchers a day compared to - a year ago. Deborah Clay, , from Sheerness-on-Sea, the bus’s next stop, has been without gas since Christmas Eve. A former baker and confectioner battling bad health and living alone, she racked up energy debts so agreed to switch to a prepayment meter, paying off that debt incrementally from each top up. But on Christmas Eve when she put on £ for gas, there was a fault and it didn’t register. She had no more to add. Struggling to get hold of her energy supplier, out of minutes on her phone, she battled on with only electricity and then developed pneumonia. She’s been scared to put more money on and lose it.  Raspy with a chest infection, she begs for Stevie’s help. Her voucher will clear her debt and standing charge, which has been mounting even though she hasn’t been using gas. And the energy company, finally reached, knocks off the lost £. Today is a good day, but it’s firefighting. She calculates energy costs her around £ a fortnight, even scrimping, and without her debt.“I borrowed an electric one-bar fire and have slept on the settee,” she admits. “I’ve boiled the kettle to wash up, I shower maybe once a week, it sounds skanky. For cooking I’ve used the microwave and one ring on the cooker.” William and Susan Bunce resort to sitting in the dark. Susan, , cares for William, , who has had a mini stroke, angina, and recently suffered pleurisy twice. He feels the cold painfully. Diligent Susan puts £ on electricity and £ on gas each fortnight. It won’t reach the end of that time. An extra tenner from her carer’s allowance will usually be needed to carry them through. The heating comes on for half an hour in the morning and one hour at night in the living room only - “and some days not at all.”“We don’t sit with the lights on now,” she says. “There is street light outside.“We used to shower every day, now it’s twice a week. It does get me down sometimes.” The visitor that leaves us silent, is a mum in her twenties who asks not to be named because she fears judgement.She regularly chooses electricity over gas so she can feed her two children.Today she has around £ left on gas, £ on electricity. She is searching for work, her Universal Credit is not due until later this month.“I borrow from friends, it’s a constant loop of asking,” she says, eyes glassy with tears she won’t let fall. “I go for electric so we can eat, I have been without gas for a week. “As soon as the kids come home from school they put their dressing gowns on and sit with duvets. If it’s sunny I keep them outside running around, it’s warmer.”  Stevie is despairing. A voucher only gives “breathing space”. Matthew Cole, head of Fuel Bank Foundation, says Sunak’s measures “don’t go far enough for those who need them the most”, and wants additional targeted support. Before a pm deadline Stevie must rush to process the vouchers, responsibility weighing heavy. “The problems feel so huge, I can’t think of anything ,” she says.

It’s about taking back political control from local councils through metro mayors imposed by Whitehall. Nobody has asked for this revolution in local government – indeed, when asked, people voted against it.But the Tories ploughed ahead, and they intend to accelerate the process.The price for giving back half the money they’ve taken away from councils since  is to demand directly elected regional bosses. They think they can win those elections with candidates like ambitious, loud-mouthed Ben Houchen, mayor of the traditionally Labour area, Teesside. mayors have limited powers over transport and suchlike, but as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic, they are largely illusory. Westminster still rules.The combined voices of West and South Yorkshire mayors failed utterly to save the Leeds-Manchester Northern Powerhouse Rail route, or the HS high-speed rail link to London.Michael Gove, the Grovelling-Up-To-Boris Secretary, talks airily of better local transport. But the Tories have halved the “bus back better” fund.They wasted more money on unusable PPE in six months than they propose to give poorer regions in the years to , when this dog’s breakfast of a blueprint for Britain is designed to mature. Levelling up is a classic Conservative trick, to wrest back and retain control over millions of voters in provincial England. Scotland and Wales chose their own form of devolution. They don’t need or want these newfangled regional gaffers. The trick won’t work there.mayors are fake devolution. They get saddled with responsibility for things like buses they haven’t the money to put right, but no real powers to make le better for the people they are supposed to represent. Don’t be fooled. Kidsapos jabs going missing The understandable fixation with jabs for Covid has unwelcome side effects. The number of children having vaccinations against measles has dropped off, leaving one in  new kids in school without protection. Health chiefs fear an outbreak of this highly infectious, potentially deadly diseasethey’re not inoculated. This grim news comes as the Government does a screeching U-turn on mandatory Covid jabs for all NHS staff, on pain of dismissal. On balance, this is the right thing to do. But I fear the decision will strengthen the nutcase anti-vaxxers campaigning for an end to all jabs.Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who called off the sacking threat , has a big job restoring public faith in vaccination.Is he up to it  I wonder.  Break this spell Salford University students are warned that scenes in Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations might upset them. Even more incredibly, at Chester University “trigger warnings” were issued about the risks of reading Harry Potter. Crazy. I spent much of my first year at university reading Russian novels such as Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. They would give the little dears a nervous breakdown. But fiction that accurately reflects reality prepares you for le better than a whole library of woke warnings.

And she blamed the Prime Ministeraposs researchers and advisers for hoods Boris Johnson has said in Parliament, insisting he tells the truth to the best of his knowledge.The Culture Secretary appeared affronted when she was asked by host Charlie Stayt when she last spoke to Boris Johnson, whom sheaposd been sent on TV to defend. Asked when sheaposd last spoken to the Prime Minister, Ms Dorries shrugged, looked quizzically into her webcam, and replied: Why  During the exchange, Stayt said he was really confused, asking Ms Dorrieshis question was a dficult one. The presenter asked: Have you spoken to the Prime Minister recently, in the last  hours  After a brief pause, a smiling Ms Dorries replied: Why  Why are you asking me that question  Stayt replied: Iaposd like to know. Dorries simply said: Weaposve communicated.  Appearing perplexed, Stayt went on to say: Iaposm really confused. Is that a dficult question  Iaposm just askingyouaposve spoken to the Prime Minister, in the last  hours. Dorries repeated: We have communicated. Stayt went on to ask what Mr Johnson had communicated to her, but Ms Dorries declined to go into detail. She said: Iaposm not going to tell you the extent of my communications with the Prime Minister. I mean, Iaposve answered your question. We have communicated. What is your next question  When Stayt asked about the PMaposs mood, Dorries described it as very positive, extremely positive. Elsewhere in her media round, she mixed up two Tory MPs with the same surname, claimed % of Tory MPs back the PM and blamed remainer enemies for plotting against him. She admitted there are a number of reasons actually, itaposs not just one, but she said: That certainly is at play with a group.  However, out of the  Tory MPs who have so far publicly called on Boris Johnson to go, just seven of those had publicly backed remaining in the EU in the  referendum.One of those who has said the Prime Minister should go is David Davis, who served as Brexit Secretary, and another is strident Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen.But Ms Dorries told Times Radio: There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of Remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit. Ms Dorries was also forced to insist Mr Johnson tells the truth as the PM came under sustained pressure over the future of his premiership. She said Mr Johnson told the truth to the best of his knowledge based on what he was told by his aides. Challenged about a claim made by Mr Johnson in the Commons about the number of people in work before and after the pandemic, Ms Dorries told BBC Breakfast: He will have been given by advisers and researchers the fact that there were more people in work than there were at the beginning of the pandemic, not on the payroll. She said: So did he tell the truth when he quoted that  Yes, he told the truth as it was given to him. I can personally tell you that the Prime Minister, when he stands at the despatch box and makes quotes like the one you just quoted, is because the researchers and his advisers will have given him that quote, and thataposs... and he was truthful, to the best of his knowledge, when he made that quote, she said. She added: The Prime Minister does tell the truth.  Honesty was one of the key reasons former minister Nick Gibb said on Friday that he could no longer support the PM, and had submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady. Writing in The , Mr Gibb, MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, said his constituents were furious about the double standards and he said the Prime Minister had been inaccurate in statements to the Commons. He said: The Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about a Christmas party that she hadnapost attended, but he wonapost take responsibility for those that he did attend. I am sorry to say that it is hard to see how it can be the case that the Prime Minister told the truth. The MP said: To restore trust, we need to change the Prime Minister. Backbencher Aaron Bellalso declared publicly he had submitted a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in his leader. John Glen, a Treasury minister and Salisbury MP, said the situation with No  was deeply uncomfortable, disappointing, and embarrassing. Writing in his local newspaper The Salisbury Journal, he did not call for the Prime Minister to resign but said: The culture in Number  fell short of what the country had a right to expect, and responsibility must be taken for the mistakes that were made. The interventions brought the number of Tory MPs who have now publicly called for Mr Johnson to resign to . Privately, the number is expected to be higher.  Mr Johnson also lost five No  aides in  hours on Thursday and Friday. But Ms Dorries insisted % of Conservative MPs were behind the Prime Minister.This included, she said, the Health Secretary following comments over the Prime Ministeraposs allegation that Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. She said: I spoke to Sajid Javid last night and he reassured me that he is % behind the Prime Minister.In fact, I think heaposs quite shocked at how his comments have been interpreted.  Mr Javid said Sir Keir deserved absolute respect for the job he did as director of public prosecutions and that it was important that the Prime Minister claried his earlier accusation that Sir Keir had failed to prosecute Savile.Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had said he would not have made the comments.Ms Dorries said her Cabinet colleague was entitled to his views. Ms Dorries told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that anybody who leads an organisation, like the Prime Minister leads the Government or Keir Starmer led the Crown Prosecution Service, when something goes wrong, you take responsibility and you apologise. She said: Rishi Sunak is entitled to his views and you know, heaposs entitled to say... make any comments that he wants to. Ms Dorries was defending the Prime Minister as other Tory MPs are expected to consider over the weekend whether to write to the chairman of the  Committee Sir Graham in an attempt to force a leadership contest.Former minister Dr Liam Fox has said he is waiting to see what comes out of the full Sue Gray report into the partygate saga.Mr Johnson was facing fresh accusations on Saturday after The Mirror reported that the politan Police had been handed a photograph of Mr Johnson holding a beer at an alleged gathering in June  to mark the Prime Ministeraposs birthday.

Carr issued a trigger warning to the audience at the beginning of his one-hour Netflix special, His Dark Material, admitting his performance contained terrible things. Ms Dorries described the joke as shocking, but said it would not be covered by the forthcoming Online Harms bill. But she said: Another bill that we have to come through is a media bill, which we are looking at including those aposvideo on demandapos, streaming organisations such as Netflix, weaposre looking at including those into the scope of that bill She said the Government was looking to make the kind of comments that Jimmy Carr made ... also subject to a new law that will impose sanctions on those organisations.  The Government launched a consultation last year on whether streaming services should be regulated by Ofcom and given the same level of protections as traditional television. The consultation notes any regulatory change will need to be proportionate, to ensure freedom of expression is not undermined. The Department for Culture Media and Sport said they were working on a response to the consultation, which would be published in due course. Ms Dorries said Mr Carraposs comments were abhorrent and they just shouldnapost be on television, but it was put to her that in a tweet in  she had claimed that left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy. She said: Well, thataposs not comedy. What Jimmy Carr did last night is not comedy.And you know, Iaposm no angel on Twitter, nobody is, but I just would like to say that nothing Iaposve ever put on Twitter has been harmful or abusive.But that last night... Jimmy Carraposs comments, no one can call that, you know, snowflake or wokeishness, thataposs just... it was just appalling. She said the comments were shocking and abhorrent and unacceptable, not just because he was making fun on the basis of people who died in the most appalling circumstances, but on the pain and suffering of many thousands of families. She told Times Radio: We donapost have the ability now, legally, to hold Netflix to account for streaming that but very shortly we will. Asked on Sky Newsthere was any way this new law would put restrictions on free speech, she said: No, absolutely not. Weaposve been very, very... well because Iaposm a Conservative, Iaposve been very, very careful about that. The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, said: This is truly disturbing and goes way beyond humour. In a tweet, the charity said: We need all your support in calling this out #StopTravellerHate StopFundingHate. The charity has launched a petition to Netflix calling for the removal of the segments of His Dark Material which celebrates the Romani genocide. Not-for-profit organisation the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust shared a statement on Twitter from their chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman who was horried to hear gales of laughter following Carraposs remarks. The Auschwitz Memorial called for Carr to learn about the fate of some  thousand Roma  Sinti deported to Auschwitz in a tweet to their . million followers.

Bob Blackman, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Groupfor Azerbaijan, said on a podcast: “On a regular basis I put down positions on behalf of our good friends in Azerbaijan.” He has been on seven trips worth tens of thousands of pounds to the country since . And in his role as head of the APPG, he has also been given briefings by high level figures, including Azerbaijani MP Javanshir Feyziyev, in  and . Corruption is understood to be high in Azerbaijan, and occurs at all levels of government by some members. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index- given on a scale of  - for highly corrupt - to , for very clean - gave Azerbaijan a score of . Since , Azerbaijanaposs government has undertaken a campaign of prosecuting corrupt officials - with high ranking central and local government officials, cabinet ministers and high-ranking military officers coming under the spotlight. The investigations have included charges of bribery, abuse of power and fraud. In  it emerged a so-called Azerbaijani laundromat had operated among the countryaposs ruling elite - who used a secret slush fund to pay off local politicians, buy luxury goods and launder money. The website openDemocracy last nightrevealed that in the last  months, Mr Blackman tabled four pro-regime motions in the house, and written to two foreign secretaries, urging them to strengthen ties with Azerbaijan and condemn its opponent Armenia. Apart from one instance, the MP did not declare his interests. He declared a relevant interest before tabling his first motion in July , noting “acts of aggression by Armenia” and calling on the UK government to “condemn [Armenia’s] recent actions.” In October , Mr Blackman tabled a second motion, urging the UK Government to condemn Armenia for blatantly violating a ceasefire agreement with Azerbaijan. He failed to declare an interest when tabling the motion, despite having taken a trip to Baku in February that year, paid for by the Azerbaijani Parliament. He did, however declare an interest when asking a question about a territorial dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the commons later the same day.The following week he wrote to then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, repeating word-for-word a statement issued previously by Azerbaijanaposs foreign policy adviser, Hikmat Hajiyev.Mr Blackman neither declared a relevant interest in his letter to Raab nor made clear the source of his claims. In November, he tabled a third motion, “to show solidarity with the Azerbaijani people who have been resilient by publicly demonstrating in such huge numbers in support of their right to live in peace in their historical lands”.  Mr Blackman declared no relevant interest on the motion. He took a further trip to Baku, paid for by the Azerbaijani Parliament, in November last year . Several weeks later, he tabled a fourth early day motion on Azerbaijan and Armenia relations that included a line expressing “support for the British companies that are involved in the reconstruction of the liberated lands in the Nagorno-Karabakh”. The MP again declared no relevant interest. All of Mr Blackman’s trips to Azerbaijan were properly registered with Commons authorities. His chairmanship of the APPG is also properly registered. But Commons rules require members to declare registered interests “whenever they are relevant,” including when asking questions in the chamber, submitting motions and speaking to ministers. Since Mr Blackman became MP for Harrow East in , he and his staff have taken trips to Azerbaijan worth more than £, in total. The three most recent – in November , February , and September  – were funded by either Azerbaijan’s London embassy or the Azerbaijani parliament. Some trips were funded by the European Azerbaijan Society, a UK-based lobbying group. Mr Blackman’s first motion, tabled in July , was made the same day he and the Azerbaijan APPG met with Mr Feyziyev and Azerbaijan’s ambassador to the UK, Tahir Taghizadeh. Shortly afterward, Mr Blackman spoke candidly about his work as chair of the APPG on the “Eye to Eye” podcast. “One of the things that happens, I’m afraid, in these types of conflicts is that [...] whoever gets the best propaganda tends to grab the attention of the listeners and the viewers,” he said. “And in this regard I’ve been fed the information through the Azerbaijan embassy in the UK – so they’ve been very, very helpful, very, very proactive from the word go when the hostilities began on  July.” He added: “I was getting information straight away, and that’s why I tabled the early day motion and why we did as much media as we could.”openDemocracy has also obtained a letter Bob Blackman sent to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, about a visit he made to Azerbaijan in November .In the December-dated letter, released to openDemocracy after a Freedom of Information request, the MP urged Truss to update the Azerbaijan APPG “on what steps the government is taking to strengthen trade, economic and political ties with Azerbaijan”. The MP did not mention in the letter that the recent trip had been paid for and organised by the Azerbaijani parliament. Nor did he draw the foreign secretary’s attention to his register of interests, as the rules require. Mr Blackman said: “I’m not making any comment at all, whatsoever.” He added that there were “at least two things wrong” in the allegations put to him by the Mirror - but declined to explain what they were. He added: “As far as I’m concerned, everything I’ve ever done for Azerbaijan has been properly declared.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Bob BlackmanLiz TrussConservative PartyTransparency InternationalPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite witnesses hearing a bang and a scream following the impact, the parcel man drove away from the scene without checkingthe pedigree Hungarian wire haired Vizsla was okay. The six-year-old dog, who twice qualied for the Crufts puppy class and won several open shows, was put down by a vet later that day. Nothing can replace Moka, Shirley told The Mirror. I was absolutely gobsmacked when it happened. There were  people walking across that field with their dogs.  It could have been a child on the track. Shirley, from Norfolk, was at a shoot on a pig farm on November  last year when Moka went to collect a bird. The van came back from the houses really fast, she recalled. I heard a bang and a scream. I could see the van through the numerous gaps in the thin hedge. I ran through a gap in the hedge and one of the guys who had been shooting shouted at the driver, but after momentarily braking he sped off. The van driver had gone right over Moka and It was clear that she had at least a broken leg. I immediately covered her with my coat in an attempt to stop her going into shock and called my vets to let them know what had happened. Shirley, , took her dog for treatment for a broken leg, but she had to be put down later that night. The part-time administrator contacted Amazon and found the company to be very empathetic at first. About two weeks later they responded that the driver was a contract driver and not employed directly by them, and he had referred the matter to his insurance company, she claimed. However, after I stated that he was representing Amazon they paid the amount of the vets bill direct into my bank account. An Amazon spokesperson said: “We have very high standards for our delivery service providers and how they serve customers. We are taking this matter seriously and have reached out to Ms Cooper to offer our support.

Buckingham Palace released the new photos to celebrate the Monarchaposs  years in the throne. Taken in Windsor Castleaposs Oak Room a few weeks ago, the Queen sits with a display of memorabilia from the golden and platinum jubilees.In one charming snap, an inquisitive member of her household appears to want a sneak preview of her cards - her pet dog Candy. Candy is a dorgi – a cross between a corgi and a dachshund – and she made a lap of the room, inspecting a small group of media representatives capturing the viewing. The Queen said: “And where did you come from  I know what you want,” likely to be a reference to a treat, and called Candy over and gave her a stroke. The monarch, who has owned more than  corgis during her reign, currently has three dogs – Candy now quite elderly, a young corgi called Muick, and another corgi puppy which replaced Fergus the dorgi puppy, who died unexpectedly in May last year.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .One card celebrating the  Golden Jubilee caught the Queen’s eye – it was made from eight bottle tops including milk, Coca-Cola and Schweppes bottles, and had the handwritten words “Ma’am You’re The Tops”. “That’s good, simple but ingenious,” said the Queen to Dr Stella Panayotova, librarian and assistant keeper of the royal archives, who joined her for the viewing two weeks ago. The display included a Golden Jubilee letter from a nine-year-old boy called Chris, titled “A Recipe For A Perfect Queen”.  Its list of ingredients – which included “ml of royal blood”, a “dab of jewels and posh gowns” and “a dash of loyalty” – made the Queen laugh and she said: “That’s quite fun, isn’t it.” Platinum Jubilee cards were also on display and the Queen praised the design of one featuring a picture of her as a young woman surrounded by flowers with the words “ Glorious Years”.Recipes and pictures of entries to the Platinum Pudding competition were on display, showing the results of cooks who have risen to the challenge of creating a memorable dessert fit for the Queen and the nation.  Another royal aide told the Queen: “We’ve had a number of Platinum Pudding competition entries that have been coming in in recent weeks. People have been very creative.” The monarch browsed through the images of the entries and later said: “Looks like they’re all going to end with crowns on them.”She also studied a fan presented to Queen Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee in  by the then Prince and Princess of Wales, later Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.  In the years after Victoria’s jubilee it was signed by members of her family including her eldest child, the Princess Royal, known as Vicky to her relatives, and granddaughter Princess Alix, later the Tsarina of Russia, and the then prime minister the Marquess of Salisbury. The Queen opened the fan and remarked how easily it could have been damaged when being signed, adding: “Extraordinary isn’t it, and it still shuts.” Commenting on the signatures she said: “Well that’s very interesting to see, quite a gathering.” During the viewing, the Queen paid a touching tribute to her late father by wearing her aquamarine and diamond clip brooches, worn separately in a diagonal setting on her turquoise dress They were an th birthday present from her beloved “Papa”, George VI, in April . The two art deco-style pieces were made by Boucheron from baguette, oval and round diamonds and aquamarines. She also chose to wear the precious brooches when she addressed the nation on the th anniversary of VE Day in  and for her Diamond Jubilee televised speech in . Elizabeth II came to the throne  years ago this Sunday when, on February  , the ailing king, who had lung cancer, died at Sandringham in the early hours. The Queen, who is staying on the Sandringham estate, usually spends each Accession Day privately, reflecting on the bittersweet anniversary of the loss of her father and the start of her reign.

While the Queen will be celebrating her landmark period as monarch it will also be a sad occasion as it will also be  years since her father’s death this Sunday. And itaposs not the first time the Queen, , has chosen to pay a subtle tribute to her loved ones with sentimental jewellery. The monarch has also worn the brooches for other important occasions in the past including her Diamond Jubilee in  and the th anniversary of VE Day.  The then-Princess Elizabeth had a close relationship with her father and the two aquamarine and diamond clip brooches that he gave her on her th birthday in  are believed to mean a lot to her. The two-piece art deco-style brooches were made by Boucheron from aquamarines and baguette, oval and round diamond. The Queen is pictured for the Jubilee photo looking through her Platinum and Golden Jubilee cards and memorabilia as she sat with one of her pet dorgis in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle. She came to the throne on February , , following the death of George Vl from lung cancer. He died in the early hours of the morning at Sandringham.The Queen had toto the UK from Kenya where she was on a tour with Prince Philip.Usually she likes to spend the anniversary of her accession privately on her own but this year it is in the limelight as it will be her th anniversary.  And while she is reserved when speaking publicly, she is known to send subtle messages with her clothing. Her use of jewellery to help express her emotion was also on display for the funeral of Prince Philip last year. She wore a Richmond Brooch from Queen Mary which is one of the largest in her collection for the funeral on April , . It was made by Hunt and Roskell, and given to Queen Mary as a wedding present in  by the town of Richmond.  Queen Mary’s family, the Tecks, had lived at White Lodge in Richmond Park for more than two decades. The brooch they offered to the royal was made of diamonds set with two pearls, a large round centre pearl, plus a detachable pear-shaped pearl drop. For Prince Philip’s funeral, the Queen opted to wear the brooch without the pear-shaped pearl. Although the monarch wore it sparingly in the first years of her reign, it has become a more staple piece in her brooch collection. The Queen is not the only royal to carefully send a message through her clothing and jewellery choices, with Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle wearing gems from the late Princess Dianaaposs collection given to them by their husbands to signicant events.Meghan used Dianaaposs aquamarine cocktail ring as her apossomething blueapos on her wedding day. The Duchess of Cambridge, who wears Dianaaposs engagement ring, borrowed a tiara from the Queen for her  wedding to Prince William. Royal author Elizabeth Holmes said: “Royal jewellery is beautul, yes, but it’s also saying something. The minute any of these women step out of the car, we see pictures around the world in seconds. And what you notice first is what they’re wearing. They use that. It’s very savvy and it’s very smart, and it’s worth paying attention to.” Stylist Georgia Michalopoulou explained how the Queen sends messages through her clothes and jewellery. She rarely wears the same outfit twice and matches them with similarly coloured accessories.Some of her jewelry are gts that she has been given while on the thrown as well as family heirlooms.Mr Michalopoulou told the Express : “The Queen is known for sending messages through her choices of clothes as she did with her brooch choice at Prince Phillipaposs funeral where she wore a brooch that she was wearing on their honeymoon.”The Queen’s Jubilee will be marked in the UK with celebrations during a four day bank holiday weekend from June  to .

Customer Suzi Ashworth, , had to get a neighbour to use a broom to retrieve her parcel from outside an office building window on January . The artist, from Folkestone, Kent, said she received a notication from Yodel saying her parcel was left in a safe place on her porch. Suzi was left baffled because she doesnapost have a porch. She went around the street asking local businesses, who then discovered the item had been thrown above an art studio.  CCTV shows the courier standing in the middle of the road and looking up at a window with the package in hand. He then wanders closer to the door before launching the item into the air towards an office window. CCTV shows how the delivery driver did not attempt to knock on the door or speak to someone. The parcel lands directly onto the anti-bird spikes, impaling the display item inside.  The courier then nonchalantly snaps a picture on his phone to show proof of the delivery before wandering away. A second clip later that day shows Suzi trying to retrieve the item on a ladder but unable to reach it with a broom handle. Two men then step in to hold the base of a step ladder whilst a third man finally manages to retrieve the parcel from the metal spikes.  Suzi complained to Yodel who said they had taken drastic measures with the courier involved. Suzi said: Maybe he deserved some measure, retraining, or a telling off. But I think the real problem with Yodel is not one inidual employee but a culture of unrealistic delivery schedule demands on employees combined with the distrustful approach towards their staff in the form of GPS tracking exact employee movements. Plus their deliberately dficult customer contact system.  We borrowed a ladder and had some dficulty getting it down as the office window it landed near was unable to open for some reason. It was completely wrecked as it was a polystyrene display item and was impaled by the pigeon spikes, dented by the throw and then tapped with a broom handle until we could free it. Suzi said that during a phone call on Friday morning, Yodel claimed to have removed the courier from the company. She said: Yodel phoned this morning and very proudly told me they had aposremovedapos the courier from the company.  Iaposm actually starting to feel sorry for this guy as the more I deal with yodel the more apparent it is that they must be very unpleasant to work for. I think the whole culture of the company is a bit extreme. The guy made a stupid judgement call, weaposve all done it. A Yodel spokesperson said: We take driver behaviour very seriously and this incident clearly does not meet our standards. We have taken appropriate action with the driver following an investigation and are in touch with the customer to apologise.

Most Brits will get it wrong in their practical test first time around, according to the DVSA.While the pass rate for tests is . per cent in the UK, on average adults will face the test . times before achieving success behind the wheel. According to data,  per cent will need more than three attempts. Ian Fido, head of training at RED Driving School, has revealed the common mistakes people make when they look to lose their L-plates. Delays due to Covid have put pressure on learner to take their tests as soon as possible, he said. But he told The Sun the biggest error is booking yourself in when you are not just ready.Another regular mistake, he feels, comes in the form of failure to take a practice test before under-taking the real thing. Two other issues he raises come at an early stage once inside the vehicle. Ian says too many people still donapost check their mirror when under pressure - while others fail to move off safely. Not knowing the Highway Code is also problematic and he feels a high number arenapost sure about what some road signs actually mean.  A vital part of driving is being aware of your surroundings and the dferent dangers - that is something the head of training says often gets overlooked. His final piece of advice is an easy one - always ask your instructor what will happen on the day, because being prepared will ease the mind and allow a learner to relax. But the main issue is rushing in and failing will only dent your confidence. He explained: With the delays in being able to book a driving test there is increasing pressure on learners to pass first time.

The family of five are being evicted from the house in Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, on Monday February , Yorkshire Live reports. They were given the marching order on January , after having failed to pay rent for several months. Parents Amy Winter, , and Joshua Thain, , told Yorkshire Live they made Barnsley Council aware of their situation months ago and claim the local authority hasn’t helped. The parents, who each claim Universal Credit, have been living at the house with their children Skye, five, Daisy-Mae, four, and Lexi,  months, with another child on the way as Amy is currently five months pregnant. Amy said: “It’s that bad we don’t go out or anything because we’re worried. I’ve asked my familythey can help, they can’t help with accommodation because they’re only living in one bed and two bedroom houses.  “The only person who is trying to help is my partner’s uncle but he lives down in Somerset. “I think Barnsley Council need to get off their backside and figure out what they’re going to do, instead of just telling us one thing and next thing a dferent thing.”Neither the parent’s names are on the tenancy agreement for the property, which is owned by Sanctuary Housing. They claim to have stayed there with late grandma Victoria Robertshaw, Joshua’s mother, to look after her whilst she was ill. The -year-old died after testing positive for Covid- in August.Amy is also not pleased with Sanctuary Housing, alleging their officers were rude to her. Amy said: “They [Sanctuary Housing] were being rude about it, saying they would just put us on the streets. We’re just waiting for them to break down the door now. Barnsley Council has said ‘just keep your doors locked’.”  Barnsley Council says it’s offered advice around dferent housing options but Amy claims the only options offered would split-up the family even further - Amy and Josh have another child Macauli, , who lives with Amy’s mother. Amy said: “I ain’t separating my family up after everything that’s gone on with Josh losing his mum, I said ‘I ain’t separating my family just because you want me to’.” A spokesperson for Sanctuary Housing said: “On Monday January , an Outright Possession Order for this property was granted by a judge at court which asks the occupants to vacate it within  days. The proceedings related to signicant rent arrears that have built up with no rent being paid for several months, despite our attempts to resolve the issue before going to court.  “We have been liaising with Barnsley Council to ensure the occupants can access alternative accommodation as soon as possible, so this property can then be offered to a family who are currently waiting on Barnsley’s housing list.” Barnsley Councillor Jenny Platts, Cabinet Spokesperson for Adults and Communities, said: “Our housing team are continuing to work with the couple and are offering them advice around their housing options and support to consider alternative accommodation. “As part of this process, we have made enquiries into their current and previous housing situation, helping us explore all avenues of accommodation with them. “Our housing team are available to offer support and help whether you’re homeless or worried about becoming homeless, and they give you advice based on inidual circumstances. We encourage anyone worried about their housing situation to get in touch with us as soon as possible to make us aware of your situation.

Mr Hooper told proceedings: “I felt threatened and an Englishmanaposs home is his castle, and my castle starts at that front gate. “I thought we have a bit of a problem here, thereaposs two of them, half my age, I didnapost know what they had in terms of weapons, or what they were capable of doing. I thoughtthe car was off the property, that would be them off the property, out of the way. In his closing speech to the jury, Michael Rawlinson, defending, gave the origin of the saying, referring back to the judge Sir Edward Cokeaposs comments which set legal precedents in .Referring to arguments about how Mr Hooper could have acted dferently that day, Mr Rawlinson also quoted the boxer Mike Tyson, saying: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.Mr Burns had been drinking with friends at Low Force waterfall, and having consumed up to seven bottles of lager he was intending to walk  miles back to South Tyneside.  He told the jury he spotted his friend Elliott Johnson whose Corsa had suffered a double puncture, which was why they parked on the farmeraposs lane. In his closing remarks, David Ward, prosecuting, told the jury the Crown was not saying Mr Hooper was a thug, but that his actions were utterly irrational on the day. Judge Ray Singh had outlined routes to verdict for the jury, explaining the law surrounding self-defence and a defendant protecting himself and his property.

The couple were arrested after police stopped her Audi A car in Farnworth, near Bolton. Officers discovered a stash of cocaine, cannabis, weighing scales plus a blood stained kne hidden in the glove compartment. At Bolton Crown Court, Monks, of Farnworth, admitted acquiring criminal property and having a bladed article but she was spared jail. David Lees prosecuting said: aposaposA mobile phone was seized from Olivia Monks and this showed her collecting money on behalf of Fisher. In March  he had sent her a list of  names with sums which totalled over £,. She can be seen contacting ious people chasing up those debts. aposaposShe later responded by sending a message to Fisher indicating that  of those people had paid money. The total paid was £, which is the sum collected by Ms Monks and presumably this would eventually have been given to Mr Fisher. Officers also seized two phones seized from Fisher one showing he was selling cannabis. There were requests for large amounts of drugs, one in particular for £ and there is also a debtor’s list on his phone made that suggests a number of debtors owed him four figure sums. aposaposThe entire debtors list on his phone was for £, suggesting he was dealing in substantial quantities of drugs at the time. In January last year Fisher was given an eight month suspended prison term for dangerous driving after he crashed a stolen Ford Fiesta ST with  plates during a mph chase with police. In mitigation his counsel David Birrell said: aposaposHe was heavy user of cocaine and cannabis at the time of these offences, matters spiralled and he was selling cannabis to others he knew.  aposaposHe did have a promising football career, starting at Oldham and seemed to moving towards Manchester United but it didn’t happen and thataposs when his le took a dferent turn and he fell into this lestyle.” Fisher, of Salford, and one of his customers Dylan Gallagher, , of Farnworth were each given  months suspended for two years after they admitted possessing cocaine and having cannabis with intent to supply. Judge Martin Walsh decided not to send Monks to prison as he said the mum-of-one had been dragged into the illicit racket due to the damaging relationship with Fisher. Sentencing, he said: aposaposThis was a very large scale cannabis operation due to the volumes of money involved. aposaposItaposs not an unreasonable conclusion to make that Olivia Monks has been dragged into this as a debt collector for her boyfriend. Her offending behaviour is largely due to the damaging relationship which she had with Fisher. aposaposDrugs blight our society and the courts see on far too many occasions how lives are utterly destroyed by addiction to them.

It has led to musicians including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell to speak out against Rogan and ask for their music to be removed from Spoty.Harry and Meghan, who have been supporting vaccine equity, signed a lucrative deal with the streaming giant to host and produce podcasts, estimated to be worth around  million US dollars , in late .

Royal expert Richard Eden says they have been stuck between principles or money, reports the Daily Star. He said on Mail+ Palace Confidential that the situation was a “nightmare” for the Sussexes, pointing out that while they campaigned against misinformation their decision on Spoty showed that money came first for them The royal commentator said: “For years theyaposve gone on about the dangers of misinformation, it’s become a real pet cause of theirs.And then here they are with Spoty, accused of spreading misinformation through Joe Roganaposs very popular podcast.“But Harry and Meghan have signed a very lucrative deal with Spoty that’s meant to be worth £million. So between the principles and money, itaposs always a question of which will they go for and it seems theyaposve gone for the money.  They put out a rather sort of mealy-mouthed statement about the dangers of misinformation, but theyaposve made clear theyaposre sticking with Spoty. So it looks like sort of Joe Roganaposs won really. Eden, meanwhile, pointed out that Rogan was a hard worker and created hundreds of podcasts every year, whereas the Sussexes had only produced one.He added: My goodness, weaposve only had one from Harry and Meghan for £million so theyaposre hardly providing value for money. Royal expert Neil Sean claimed the Sussexes may have to continue working for Spoty or be ordered totheir  millionfee, reports the Express.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Mr Sean claimed: Legendary singer-songwriters Joni Mitchell and Neil Young have decided to pull their product from the  simply because they said they donapost agree with a certain element of it.  Itaposs interesting because you can only really do things like that when you are an international success when youaposre worth millions of pounds so you can make these grandiose statements. What is interesting is there are certain people that truly rely on the income that Spoty does deliver for their brand. Harry and Meghan have released a statement claiming they are staying with Spoty but what is the reason why. So far Spoty has paid Harry and Meghan an installment for these podcasts. If they decide to go out against Spoty, it makes it very dficult for Harry and Meghan because they would have tothat installment. Last week, an Archewell spokesperson said the couple are committed to continuing their work with the streaming .

He got seven years for the burglary and another three years in  for an earlier raid on a Mayfair jewellers. Jones was handed a further six years and  days for failing to repay more than six million he was said to have made from the Hatton Garden heist. Police claim two thirds of the stolen cash and jewels remain unrecovered.  By March , Jones had repaid £,. after the elderly criminals were hit by one of the biggest proceeds of crime orders in British history. He was released from HMP Hollesley Bay this week and was seen enjoying his freedom near his home in Enfield, north London. His release means Michael “Basil the Ghost” Seed, , and John “Kenny”  Collins, , are the only two members of the gang who remain in jail. Mastermind Brian Reader, , was released after serving three years in . A judge later ruled his dementia meant he did not have to go back inside for failing to repay the stolen millions. Reader is understood to still be living at his home in Dartford, south east London. Fellow ringleader Terry Perkins died in prison in  aged .  Jones, played by Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels in two films about the crime, led police to a stash of jewels hidden in a cemetery declaring “that’s all I had”. He wrote to Martin Brunt at Sky News in  saying he would take police to the location after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary. Unknown to him officers had found jewels buried in the graveyard but he led them to a separate, smaller stash, claiming that was all there was. Prosecutors said he did not tell officers about the larger bag of jewels hoping he could keep it.  Jones was also secretly recorded by police talking to Perkins while driving around London after the raid which took place over two nights during the Easter bank holiday weekend. Perkins said: “The biggest robbery in the f**king world, Dan, we was on.” Jones replied: “And what a book you could write f**king hell.” A teetotal fitness fanatic originally from Tottenham, north London, he has previous convictions including burglary, theft, robbery and handling stolen goods, which meant he has spent much of his adult le in prison. The lelong Spurs fan was so institutionalised that he referred to evenings after pm as “bang up” and would refuse to receive visitors or take phone calls. In the surroundings of his detached home, where the large wooden staircase was adorned with a carved skull, he would not sleep in bed with his partner, Valerie.  The father of two preferred to dress in a Tommy Cooper-style fez and his mother’s dressing gown, then bed down for the night in a sleeping bag on his bedroom floor. Jones would urinate in a bottle because of his obsession with the army and the SAS, and talked to his wire-haired terrier, Rocket, ashe were human. He spent his evenings reading books on crime and scouring the internet for ideas. A gang source said: “ Danny has got a likeable character. He is very forceful and impatient. “If you were on a bit of work the odds of it being successful would get better and better every week you were planning it but he would always want to do it tonight.” Fellow Hatton Garden gang member Carl Wood said of his friend during his trial: “Danny is a very sensitive guy, a very funny man. Eccentric to extremes, that everyone who knew Danny would say he was mad.”  Jones had been jailed for seven years in  and it was during this time, while in Maidstone prison, that was given a cell next to Reader’s old mentor Billy Barrett. Alarm expert Basil was the last raider to be arrested. He is serving ten years after finally being jailed in . The gang, nicknamed the “Diamond Wheezers” because of their ages, tunnelled into an underground safe deposit facility in London’s diamond district. They got hold of a key to the multiple-occupancy building, enabling Basil to simply walk in through the front door.Once inside, he let the others in through a fire escape.Dressed as workmen in high-visibility jackets and face masks, they went unnoticed as they lugged in the heavy tools needed for the job. The Mirror revealed CCTV of them in action in , showing for the first time that the raid had taken place over two nights. Jones and Basil were the only two slim enough to get into the vault through the hole they had made with a diamond tipped drill. Heather Chalk from the Crown Prosecution Service, said in : “Daniel Jones gained millions of pounds of criminal cash from the Hatton Garden burglary. “In January, the CPS showed the court that Jones had the funds to pay back his ill-gotten gains and today we have successfully argued that his default sentences should be activated. “Jones has failed to do so and will face more time in prison while the amount owed continues to stand.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVPrisonsCCTV footageMental healthCrimeJewelleryBurglaryHatton Garden robberyDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Grade II listed property is hidden away in a wooded hillside and comes with . acres of land, a cottage, an outbuilding and even a mobile classroom. The Georgian pile in in north Wales also boasts fine views of the countryside which can be enjoyed from one of its  bedrooms Would-be buyers have the chance to owning the three-storey property when it goes up for auction in March.Marle Hall stands out from its surroundings and has been used for a range of purposes, from a luxury country home to a convalescent home, WalesOnline reports.The property has been put up for auction with an astonishing guide price of just £,.In London this amount would only buy a four-bedroom house in London such as one being sold by Foxtons in Docklands.It was hit by a fire in the mid th century which destroyed the main house, according to Cadw.The only section that remained habitable was the east wing. The house that once stood on the plot is said to have been built in  for Sir Hugh Williams, th Baronet of Penrhyn, dated by a beam in the hall that survived the fire. With views over the beautul Conwy Valley from its elevated position, near Snowdonia National Park and the coastline at Llandudno, itaposs not a surprise the spot was chosen by Williams for his striking mansion. The mansion gained its Grade II listing in , amended in , for its aposspecial architectural interest as primarily an early th century convalescent home of definite character, with signicant earlier origin as a country house.  It was then opened as a convalescent home in  and became a nursing home from . In  it was bought by Warwickshire County Council who operated it as an outdoor learning centre providing residential trips and courses for schoolchildren from that English county. However, the centre closed in October  and has now been put up for auction with a guide price of just £,. From  Cadw states Marle Hall was rented by the Birmingham Saturday Club, who later purchased, refurbished and rebuilt the house, with extensions at the rear.  The imposing mansion greets you with an impressive, symmetrical Georgian façade with a delightful glass covered front veranda surely the most pleasing place to gather and socialise whilst admiring the views. And although the interior is set up as the outdoor centre, plenty of period features survive, with a few in the core of the house dating back to its Tudor beginnings. Arguably the most glorious of the features is the entrance hall and staircase, boasting wood wall ling, intricate carved newel posts, Jacobean-style balusters and stained glass window . Exposed ceiling beams, a stone fireplace and fancy wooden double doors are extra features that instantly impress once you walk through the carved stone archway dating back to Tudor times, from the front door into the main reception hall.  Thereaposs multi-layered cornicing to reward youyou look up and either tiles, wood floorboards or beautully sanded parquet flooringyou look down within some of the main ground floor reception rooms. The huge, classic Georgian windows in the main rooms ensure each space is bursting with light and the abundance of wood in the primary rooms add visually warmth to the white and pale blue colour palette. Thereaposs a fancy metal and tiled fireplace in one of the reception rooms but the decor is, of course, set up to be operational as an outdoor education centre, so the interior design is minimal and simple to be ideal for its past commercial usage. Thereaposs a large, commercial kitchen, a large dining room with long tables and multiple chairs, carpeted classrooms, offices and lounges.  The house has a large boot room and changing room, and a space allocated to drying out wet kit. The remaining two floors above are mainly dedicated to dormitories and washing facilities, as well as a few more classrooms and break-out rooms. The accommodation in the main house is completed by a basement.  Outside, as well as woodland to explore, there are outbuildings to have a rummage around too. The main property within the grounds is a Grade II listed cottage, with a charming ceiling beamed kitchen, fireplace in the living room and three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs. This property proposition overlooking Llandudno in Conwy, can offer a new owner plenty to consider. The dream home scenario is an amazing and super posh country pad once the house has been ed to a residential dwelling, as it currently has C use. This classication is for the provision of residential accommodation as use as a hospital or nursing home, residential school or college, or training centre.  Any changes to the house will need planning consent, with the Grade II listing as an important element. But the agent selling the house suggests a number of uses for Marle Hall, such as a boutique hotel with its location so close to the coast and Snowdonia, with ownersapos accommodation in the onsite cottage. Conversion into a complex of apartments might be an option to investigate too, but who wouldnapost want to dream about owning this country pile all for themselves, as Sir Hugh Williams did all those centuries ago  Marle Hall is going to auction with a guide price of £, on March , but is likely to sell for more, with Savills.

The large inflatable creature arrived in Leicester Square and has already caused something of a consternation on social media. People made suggestive remarks about the giant lime-coloured dino which was presumably supposed to attract the attention of kids. Unfortunately, it did gather some interest, but mainly from adults who reckoned it had more than a passing resemblance to male genitalia. The erection of the inflatable attracted a string of posts on Twitter including one from @moanystark who posted the giant creature on his feed.Along with the picture he wrote It’s all gone a bit Phoenix Nights in Leicester Square.  Other amused posters responded to the post and questionedthe creature, which has dark eyes at the end of its long green neck, was attracting the right people. @idlewildgirl said: Is it meant to…look like that   While others guffawed at the dinosaur and what it actually looked like. The creature was aposerectedapos as part of a promotion for the latest JackAss comedy flick according to one user on Reddit.  @thehibachi wrote: For those unaware, it’s promo for Jackass Forever. One poster who responded said: Ah! That’s why it’s phallic shaped! The giant green creature also had orange spikes on its back and y tale which allowed for more jests. Another Reddit poster said: There was no way this wasnapost deliberate  @Fancy Hawk wrote Get that bloody loveoff my club premises! Adults clearly thought the giant green specimen was aimed at them rather than children. And its arrival in Leicester Square provoked some amusing reactions as one person guarded it in case high winds sent it towering off in another direction. Other couples posed for selfies with the inflatable which began to draw crowds when it first went up in the square.  Tourists were also intrigued by the giant  ft inflatable which also sported some giant dinosaur claws which looked liked they could cause a bit of damage. But it was its likeness to a male member which left people in most amused and continued to attract attention during the day. Passers-by stopped and took pictures on their phones and were surprised by its size.  The film Jackass Forever, which the giant green creature was promoting is a black comedy directed by and is he sequel to Jackass D which was released in . It is a compilation of stunts, pranks and skits and opens with a parody of Godzilla where cast members fight off the monster.

Faye Hughes lost her eight-month daughter Nancy Thorpe and wants to honour all angel babies. The -year-old mum woke to a living nightmare when she found Jorgie-May, who was her youngest child, had passed away The mum, who has four other children, said little Jorgie-May had been ill in the months leading up to her untimely death. But she is determined to keep her daughteraposs name alive by raising money and awareness of Nancyaposs plight.On the fateful night before June , , Faye told North Wales Live : nothing would settle her.  That evening, the pair had lots of mummy snuggles before they both fell asleep. But when Faye woke and found Jorgie, her world was broken. She said: Jorgie was born on October ,  at .pm with my mum and sister at my side. My family was complete. I was the luckiest mummy alive to have beautul children. But, on December , , Jorgieaposs le changed. She was admitted to hospital in Bangor with breathing dficulties. She was so poorly she was nearly vented offand taken to Alder Hey. I thought that was the worst day, but that was still to come. Jorgie scared the doctors because she couldnapost keep oxygen in her body or generate it around her body like other children. She was monitored at Bangor in case we did have to go to Alder Hey, but my girl smashed it and was allowed home in time for her brother and sisteraposs Christmas shows. She was finally diagnosed with bronchitis.From that moment on, we were regulars at the doctors and hospitals.We had an amazing Christmas at home as a family. aposBring on ,apos we all cheerfully said on New Yearaposs Eve. But we were still regular patients at the doctors come January, February, March, April and May because I was so scared for her breathing. I remember a doctors appointment where Jorgie had to be put on a nebuliser because her breathing was bad. Faye added: Then came the night of June , .  Faye said she took her daughter, Phoebe dancing while Jorgie stayed home with dad, Rob. She didnapost seem right and was full of cold and snotty, Faye recalled. The mum put her children to bed but nothing would settle Jorgie, said Faye. At .pm, we went downstairs and had Calpol and mummy snuggles, she said. I put Jorgie to sleep next to me and we both fell asleep. We both woke at around .am when Rob got home from darts. Again, me and my girl went back to sleep as the only thing that would settle her was me. It was am the next morning when I woke and something was telling me to look at Jorgie. That feeling no mum should ever feel. My world was broken. My Jorgie-May fell silently to sleep. I just knew in my heart she was gone. I just remember screaming my house down. The days after her funeral most of the time were a blur. Faye said baby loss isnapost a subject that is often spoken about and that there are thousands of parents living with overwhelming grief on a daily basis.Thataposs why she has thrown her weight behind several campaigns and events to raise awareness and has set up a fundraising page. The next event she is organising is a aposSleeping Babies Fundraiserapos to raise money for the Lullaby Trust which supported Faye and her family through their bereavement.  She said: When Jorgie-May grew her wings, the support from the Lullaby Trust was absolutely amazing. They even provided toys and books for the kids to help them cope with their loss. Paying tribute to Jorgie, Faye added: Jorgie was a happy, beautul baby who warmed everyoneaposs hearts. Everyone she met instantly fell in love with her. She will always be remembered and will never be forgotten. Letaposs keep our babiesapos memories lit so bright and remember them with smiles or tears.

For seven decades she has led this nation with grace, dignity and an unswerving sense of duty. Through a period of great change and sometimes great challenges, she has been a source of strength and inspiration. She has led the country through times of celebration and comforted us during times of hardship. Her Majesty’s humility, dedication and decency have been an example to us all. It has been her honour to serve and our honour to have been served by her.  Vain  unable It is hardly surprising that so many staff are leaving Downing St and more Tories have submitted letters of no confidence. No person with any self-respect could defend Boris Johnson’s behaviour. The Prime Minister arrogantly believed he did not have to follow the rules that he expected the rest of the country to follow. If his arrogance has been his undoing, it could be his vanity that seals his fate. Despite claiming he did not break any rules there is photo evidence of him clutching a beer at his lockdown birthday party. The fact it was taken by his vanity photographer shows pride does come before a fall. Go Team GB Good luck to Team GB in the Winter Olympics.

Guests at the glitzy bash, thrown by a Libyan businessman in the south of France, saw the Prince, then , cavort with the -year-old. The pair were playfully pictured dancing the night away after being introduced by artist Jeffery Dread.Images from the encounter have resurfaced as Andrew fights for his future after being told he must face a civil trial on allegations he ­sexually abused Virginia Giuffre when she was . He denies the accusations.  Andrew was pictured partying at the millionaireaposs playground  years ago.But the Evening Standard claim she was dating Prince Albert of Monacoaposs right-hand-man Bruno Philipponnat at the time.Mr Dread said at the time: Andrew came over to me and asked, aposWhataposs her name  She is beautul. I love the way she carries herself, she is very classyapos - Iaposd known Chris for years and I was the one who took her to the party. The dancefloor was by the swimming pool and there were many beautul girls flocking to Andrew, but he was completely focused on Chris.  I felt it was not my business to say she was dating someone  and she danced with Andrew for most of the evening until the party ended at about am. He followed her everywhere she went, even to the bathroom, and at one point he gave her a head massage. But despite getting closer, her friend was quick to insist the socialite went home with her friends that night. Three years ago, it was reported she got into real trouble over the pictures of her with royal that night. But her long-time friend Richard Gradner said nothing should be read into at the party. These photos of her with Prince Andrew do not show Chrisapos true character, he said. If she was into partying, she has cleaned up her act greatly since those days and taken a dferent path. But one former regular on the Saint Tropez party scene said the Prince was properly letting his hair down after his freedom was confirmed: These were really crazy years for Andrew. He was clearly having a full-blown midle crisis, the partygoer is quoted as saying. He would have been  or  at the time, orced from Sarah Ferguson, and basking in the attention he got from young women.

Julia Samuel, who was friends with Diana, said the late princess started the tradition that the godparent should buy a gt for the children that was the most hilariously inconvenient and dficult to make.She shared her memories of the eccentric tradition in an episode of the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. “So I do to George what [Diana] did to us... which is give impossible toys which are really noisy, take a lot of making, she said. “I come in slightly tipped by the size of the present that William then has to spend days putting together and then put all the machinery together. It makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that. That makes me laugh and it makes George laugh.”Ms Samuel spoke about how much Diana would have loved her grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.The godmother, , said the young prince is amazing and that it is heartbreaking for all of them. “He’s funny and feisty and cheeky and God [Diana] would have loved him so much. That is heartbreaking for all of them,” she added.Ms Samuel, who is one of Prince George’s seven godparents, used to work in publishing before training as a counsellor, reports the Express.She met Diana at a dinner party in  and helped create Child Bereavement UK in .  The godmother received an MBE in  and now works as a bereavement counsellor in the paediatrics department at St Mary’s Hospital Paddington. Royal expert Katie Nicholl believes Prince William and Kate are careful when it comes to the presents they buy their children, despite living a le of privilege. She told OK! magazine: “George enjoys his iPad at school, both he and Charlotte are quite tech-savvy and, like most children, there probably are technical gadgets and such like on their wish list.  “Iaposm sure theyaposre not going to want for anything, but when it comes to technology and screens, they are careful not to spoil them with extravagant gting.” She added: “If it is something that happens to be a computer game or something like that then they are cautious of screen time so it could be a more practical gt.”It follows reports that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are wanting to move from London to Windsor. The couple made Kensington Palace their official home along with their three children after marrying in . They are regularly seen taking George, Charlotte and Louis on the school run and reportedly love doing fun activities such as baking, crafts and playing in the garden. But Kate and William can be strict when needed according to a source who said there is one rule in their home that the couple is firm on keeping and will likely apply in the new house.They told the Sun : Shouting is absolutely ‘off limits’ for the children and any hint of shouting at each other is dealt with by removal.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince GeorgePrince WilliamPrincess DianaRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duchess of Cambridge is set to take over as the patron of England Rugby - a position held by Harry before he and his we Meghan Markle exited their roles as senior royals, OK! reports.According to Omid Scobie, journalist and co-author of Finding Freedom, Prince Harry is aware that Kate taking over is just the name of the game. He said: Harry is very aware that thataposs just the name of the game. It was rumoured very early on that Kate would be taking on the rugby patronages.  “Sheaposs an authentic fan of the sport so I donapost think thereaposll be any disappointment there but itaposs no doubt a bittersweet moment when things that Harry was very passionate about are ending up in the hands of others. Avid sports fan Kate was announced as the new patron of the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union this week.The appointment was confirmed on the Cambridgesapos Twitter account, with the statement to say that Kate, , was excited about her new role.The mum of three said she couldnapost wait to work with two fantastic organisations who are committed to harnessing the power that sport can have in bringing communities together and helping iniduals flourish.  The news comes shortly after it was announced Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, would be taking over as the patron of the National Theatre - a role previously held by Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex. While Harry is likely to have a degree of acceptance around Kate taking over the patron role for England Rugby, Omid says Harry will be disappointed with losing his military honours. The royal expert explained: I think for him the real disappointment will always lie with losing his military honours. When he stood back from his royal role, he always understood that he would lose his royal patronages but it was the military titles he really wanted to carry forward - he had earned those. However, Omid assures Harry will remain supportive of his sister in lawaposs new role. He adds: I think,anything, heaposll probably be quite supportive of Kate taking on the new roles and seeing something he was passionate about in safe hands.

The monarch, just hours away from becoming the first British sovereign to reach a historic  years on the throne, joined members of the local community in the ballroom of Sandringham House to mark her milestone.Yvonne Browne, vice-president and chairman of the Sandringham WI, described the Queen as being on sparkling form. The event was the largest in-person public engagement the Queen had attended since before her recent health scare in mid October. The -year-old head of state arrived at the event with a wooden walking stick she rested on sagely as she leant forward to chat to the visitors. The guests were seated around tables waiting for a tea to be served but stood up respectfully to chat to the Queen. Wearing an Angela Kelly wedgwood blue crepe with white brocade dress, the Queen, who beamed with delight throughout, also carried her trademark black handbag. She cut a cake decorated with the Jubilee emblem to begin her Platinum year. Among the guests were members of the Sandringham branch of the Womenaposs Institute, Sandringham Estate pensioners and representatives from two local charities West Norfolk Befriending and Little Discoverers. The Queen also met former cookery school student Angela Wood who helped to perfect the famous dish coronation chicken served to guests after the Queenaposs  Coronation ceremony. Mrs Wood made the Queen laugh when she told the monarch she spent days and days altering it for Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume.  Commenting on how the recipe for coronation chicken has likely developed over the years the Queen told Angela Wood: Itaposs probably changed because in those days we did some things quite dferently. Shaun Mason, a junior sous chef, had created tiny bite size morsels of the coronation chicken, chicken with curry spices, apricot in a savoury tartlet, and he carried a tray of his creations into the ballroom and announced they were available to sample. As the morsels were placed between the Queen and Mrs Wood to try, the room erupted with laughter when the Queen quipped Iaposll go away, she turned to add: You can tell mewhen I come back. On October , the Queen held a Windsor Castle evening reception for delegates for the Global Investment Summit. But the next day she cancelled a two day trip to Northern Ireland, was secretly admitted to hospital for preliminary tests, before being put under doctorsapos orders to rest and only carry out light duties.  Before the pandemic the Queen would visit her WI colleagues at West Newton village hall every year as part of her winter stay on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee will be celebrated across the country during an extended June Bank Holiday in honour of a monarch who has left an indelible mark on the le of the nation. But February , the date of the Queenaposs accession to the throne, is a poignant period for the Queen, as it is the day her father King George VI died in . She is already the nationaposs longest reigning monarch, and the longest still-serving sovereign in the world. During the reception the Queen also met representatives from West Norfolk Befriending a charity which aims to reduce the social isolation experienced by the elderly by matching them with trained volunteer befrienders who visit on a regular basis.  And she spoke to members of Little Discoverers which provides early education for pre-school children with movement dficulties and delayed development. When the Queen was presented with a copy of a Loyal Address written by primary schoolchildren from West Norfolk the head of state gave a frank opinion on public proclamations she has heard during her long reign. The Queen seemed to approve of the words from the younger generation who said about the Queen: You have shown a caring manner, determination, and dedication to help other people. We think youaposre doing a great job! We are very lucky to have had you as our Queen for so long.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Rawlinson, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, earlier said: “Having reviewed the CCTV evidence and taken statements of numerous members of the public and attending officers, as well as reviewing the legal position regarding self-defence and defence of another, a decision has been taken that the driver of the car, a -year-old man will face no further police action. “He is considered a vital witness to our investigation and will be offered support from professionals to help him come to terms with the terrying situation he was confronted with. “It is vitally important that when a person dies there is a thorough investigation into all of the circumstances and this has taken place. Such decisions must be thoroughly examined and while this process takes time this has been a priority for my team. The manaposs legal advisors have been informed of this decision. “Inquests have opened in relation to both deaths and my team will continue to work to provide evidence for the Coroner.

But dieting can be tough, and who has the time to plan out dferent healthy meals for each day of the week  Now, Iceland has you covered. The frozen food giant has teamed up with Slimming World to sell a series of meals that are designed to help you lose weight, but are they any good  Intrepid journalist Dianne Bourne, from the Manchester Evening News, has now put her tastebuds on the line as she dined out on seven meals from the range - and documented the effect on her weight loss.What do you think of the frozen Slimming World meals  Let us know in the comments... Day Chicken tikka and rice lunch bowl - £. Dianne said: A great way to kick off the week of taste tests - with one of the lunch bowl meals - designed, as the title suggests, as a lighter daytime option. This is a new one to the range and I enjoyed what was a satisfying mix of crunchy vegetables, rice and tasty tikka-coated chicken pieces which was also pretty filling. Rating:   Chicken carbonara - £.  Dianne said: I was not holding out much hope for this one as it smelt slightly unpleasant as it cooked away in the microwave. Billed as a aposcomforting pasta dish with seared chicken, smoky pork strips, mushroom and spinach in a white sauceapos it did not look all that inspiring or comforting when I poured it into my dish. There were around eight pieces of chicken and a few strips of pork, and my first thought was that it seemed to taste very salty and the consistency was a bit gloopy. For me, I think Iaposd rather stick with making my own carbonara - as the Slimming World versionis a fairly simple and much cheaper recipe to make from scratch. Rating:    Day  Caullower and chick pea dahl - £. Dianne said: This can be eaten on its own or as a side dish. It probably would have been better as a side dishIaposm honest as I found it a bit unfulfilling as a lunch dish. It had a pleasant curry hit though and I like the crunch of the caullower with the chickpeas. Rating:   Chilli Con Carne - £.  Dianne said: A really hearty dish with large chunks of meat in a rich sauce and the rice was nicely herbed up. If you werenapost doing Slimming World youaposd think this was just a regular chilli ready meal, which is probably the best compliment I can give it. Indeed, my friendaposs strapping -year-old lad aposaccidentallyapos microwaved himself one of these and gave it a big thumbs up as well, so itaposs definitely good in the aposgenerous portionapos stakes. Rating:   Day  Cowboy hotpot - £.  Dianne said: Itaposs safe to say this was the dish I was most looking forward to. I mean, it has cowboy in its title and sausages and potato in it so whataposs not to love  Well, unfortunately the dish itself was what I could not learn to love. It said on the packet it was best cooked in the oven and I followed the cooking times to the tee, but it came out very dry and stodgy. It just did nothing for me at all - the sausages were firm and dry and the potatoes also had a powdery consistency on top. So disappointed with this one, definitely not a yee-ha moment from me. Rating:   Beef vindaloo - £.  Dianne said: However, tea time well and truly gave me one of the highlights of the week - in the new beef vindaloo dish. This was a real treat. A really brilliant hit of spices in a rich tomato sauce with flavoursome lumps of beef. Rating:   Day  Moroccan style chicken soup - £. Dianne said: Again, a very off-putting smell from the microwave, but once cooked this one was pretty delicious. A really interesting spice mix with a decent amount of heat, and lots of pulled chicken which made this one a warming and filling soup dish that I would definitely buy again. Rating:   Beef Lasagne - £.  Dianne said: This one has been a favourite of many SW-ers for a while now, but theyaposve just introduced a new recipe. So it is as good as the old one  Well, I was pretty excited about this one - because itaposs even better. The new recipe has finally nailed the elusive creamy cheesy aspect of the lasagne that is not easy to do.  Taking a nosy at the recipe card on the inside, it appears to be a mixture of butternut squash, potato and the magic Quark that has created the delightful crispy cheesy topping here. A word of warning on this one though - while it can be cooked in the microwave, it does say for best results stick in the oven. And, while it does take a mammoth  minutes, it tastes sooo much better this way to get that cheesy crunch. Rating:    Day  Naked beef burrito - £. Dianne said: A good amount of spice kick in this one, and itaposs quite a satisfying lunch pot. If you have your HEA of cheese available I feel like it would be nicer with this mixed in - I added some peppers and salad on the side. Rating:   Hunteraposs chicken - £.  Dianne said: This one has to be cooked in the oven and is a large portion for two, so my other half got roped into eating this one with me. It had a long cooking time of over an hour this one - and Iaposm not surethataposs why the chicken was a bit dry and chewy. And oneaposs thing for sure, it looked absolutely nothing like the glossy image on the packaging when it came out of my oven. But the overall flavour was ok - although the barbecue sauce was a tad on the watery side. My feeling is this one would be much easier and better to simply recreate yourself at home - itaposs just a rasher of bacon plonked on some chicken really. Rating:    Day  Colcannon Mash - £ Dianne said: Running a bit out of options at this stage, I decide to try the colcannon mash which I team with steamed broccoli and salmon. The mash is, like a lot of the meals, a tad on the salty side but teams well with salmon and I like that you can taste the cabbage in the mash mix. This is a convenient one to have in the freezer for those moments you canapost be bothered making your own mash. Rating:   Smoky meatball tray bake with potato wedges - £  Dianne said: The meatballs were on the dry side, but had a decent flavour punch, and were extremely pleasant when mushed together with all the smoky tomato and chickpea sauce. There was a decent size portion for two of us, although we did add lots of vegetables for speed. This was a really tasty one - but Iaposm afraid it canapost get full marks this one for the sheer faff factor. It took hr and mins to cook in the oven which comes in very low on the convenience factor - as does the vast size of the packet that I needed to try and wodge in my not very sizeable freezer. Itaposs also pretty expensive for this style of dish. Rating:   Day  Slimming World chips - £. Dianne said: Itaposs the last day, so Iaposm going all out with the curry and chips on the menu. And thereaposs literally nothing  left to eat. So I bung some of the frozen chips in the oven and serve them with some baked beans. Now with these frozen chips, people either love them or hate them from my experience at Slimming World group.  I have personally perfected a good flavour by sprinkling some syn-free spice on them and then spraying them with low-calorie spray. They do have a slightly strange consistency, but they are a convenient option to have ready-made in the freezer when you canapost face peeling and chopping up potatoes and cooking from scratch. Rating:   Chicken tikka rogan josh - £.  Dianne said: Ending the week on a high with this classic curry. The Slimming World chicken tikka masala has been a bit of a staple since the Iceland range was first launched, but this new rogan josh version might even trump it for me. Loved the spice on this one, and the added lumps of tomato and pepper. You could almost be eating a aposrealapos takeaway curry. Rating:   Did it work  Dianne said: Well, this is the big question isnapost it  After a whole week of eating the ready meals, and sticking  per cent to the Slimming World plan throughout the rest of the day, Iaposd have been guttedI didnapost lose any weight. But guess what  I did. I lost a whopping lbs. Which just goes to show sticking to aposfree foodsapos and the rest of the rules of the Slimming World plan does do the trick.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

But the cousin didnapost make le easy for the woman, and would bully her in an attempt to aposstealapos her dad. Now, the cousin is getting married and the younger woman didnapost want him walking her down the aisle - and now the whole family have been left ided. What do you think the dad should do  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the woman said: While the bullying decreased it never went away, she still makes fun of me because Iaposm single, because Iaposm dumb, etc etc. When she got engaged she excluded me from the bridal party and it wouldnapost matterit wasnapost for the fact that she included the rest of the family. She took my parents to dinner last week and asked my dad to walk her down the aisle and I donapost know what excuse he gave her but after that, he came to my room and asked meI would be okay with this.  I was honest, I said no. I told him that she made most of my le hell, even before my uncle passed away and since I was his only daughter, I thought it would be an experience between us. Well, my dad told her no and now my cousin is blaming me, telling everyone that I forced him, that I was a jealous little b***h and thatI donapost fix it then I wouldnapost be welcome at her wedding.  My mum and my aunt sided with her that it was a low blow on my part and most of her family is saying that it wasnapost fair.

One said: Your cousin is an a*****e, and all those comments are extremely mean - especially considering youaposre a teenager and sheaposs an adult  It seems like you are already aware that sheaposs the only one in the wrong, though. Then another wrote: He asked, you answered. The people in your family are cowards and nasty for coming at a teen like that over a grown manaposs decision And a third added: Your father is an adult and can make his own decisions. Itaposs good that heaposs taking your feelings into consideration, but he honestly isnapost going far enough. He should have stood up for you before and definitely needs to set the record straight with your family.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

All Tracy has to do is place her arm next to a partner to figure out his size, an attribute the yoga instructor and le coach says she really enjoys knowing about for imagination purposes when you’re not together. Given that the tat is rather discreet, this allows Tracy to innocently reach up to stroke his stomach whilst taking a glance at my arm alongside it to count the inches rather than guessing with hands.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Tracy, who describes her ink as being a somewhat discreet but practical design and tool to enhance my le, explaining: I’m a woman who enjoys pleasure, body confidence and intimacy and feel that women have just as much right as men to speak honestly about sexual encounters. With a personal best of  rolls between the sheets in one day, Tracy has a high sex drive and knows exactly what sheaposs looking for in a prospective partner. The former Page Three girl added: Being single and online dating at present, there seems to be a massive energy around the height of guys as every girl daydreams of a ft+ Prince in shining armour to sweep her off of her feet, whereas in all honesty, I dream of a ”+ Prince instead! For Tracy, the devil is in the detail and she really does enjoy knowing the size of a partner, explaining: Whilst some people keep hold of underwear or sleep in their partneraposs t-shirts, I enjoy knowing all measurements for imagination purposes when you’re not together. Tracy began considering this cheeky design following an encounter with a date who didn’t know his size, or rather didn’t choose to reveal it to me. Shocked by this admission, Tracy found her partneraposs penis to be incredibly impressive and couldnapost believe he’d never taken the time to measure himself. She joked at the time that she would bring a ruler with me next time. Her date asked her where it was and they both enjoyed a good laugh about it. This conversation led Tracy to start thinking about getting a tattoo in inches that I could take with me everywhere thus satisfying her need to measure things discreetly without making anybody feel judged or insecure. She added: “It’s not all about size, it’s what you do with it and how your partner makes you feel when building an intimate connection, but for those who enjoy finer details it really is the cherry on the cake for me.” According to Tracy, her -year-old daughter Millisent is now at an age where she realises my cheeky sense of humour and picks up on adult jokes which she’d missed before. She added: She suspected my tattoo was purposely measured in inches and I may have confirmed her suspicions when measuring cucumbers. Going forward, Tracy is rather tempted to add some dots from my thumb to my index finger to measure girth at the same time, however, she is worried that this might make her intentions too obvious. She added: I guess it all depends on where somebody is looking when I whip it out to count!”Have you opted for an unusual tattoo  Let us know in the comments or email us at yourmirror@mirrorRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory and thinks she may have unearthed the reason once and for all. Why do you think womenaposs blouses button on the opposite side to menaposs shirts  Let us know in the comments...One thoery is that menaposs shirts had buttons on the right side because most men held their swords in their right hand. This meant they needed to be able to unbutton their shirt quickly to duel and unbuttoning using their left hand was faster. As to why womenaposs buttons are on the left, many believe itaposs because women tend to carry their babies in their left arms.  Itaposs possible that womenaposs shirts were designed to be opened or closed with the free right hand to make breastfeeding easier, so they were buttoned on the left and open on the right. It also may be because way back when women were expected to ride horses sidesaddle. Buttoning up on the left may have kept the breeze from blowing up their shirts as they galloped across fields.  Another possible explanation for the iation in button placement could be traced back to the rise of emancipation when women began to abandon their girdles in favour of pants and other traditionally male clothes. As a practical technique of distinguishing between menaposs and womenaposs clothing, manufacturers placed buttons on the left side of womenaposs clothing. Melanie M. Moore, founder of womenaposs blouse brand Elizabeth  Clarke, has a dferent theory. When buttons were invented in the th century they were, like most new technology, very expensive, she told Today. Wealthy women back then did not dress themselves — their ladyaposs maid did. Since most people were right-handed, this made it easier for someone standing across from you to button your dress. There are a iety of possible reasons as to why menaposs and womenaposs shirts are buttoned dferently. At this point though, it all comes down to good old-fashioned tradition.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Thereaposs truly nothing more comforting than a big bowl of pasta and tomato sauce, and the good news is, you can make it when youaposre on a budget or your cupboards are bare and you havenapost had chance to get to the supermarket.Due to the fast-paced nature of modern le, itaposs no surprise that many people opt for sauces out of a jar to save on time and effort, but the truth is many of these jars are jam-packed with sugar and additives and can cost more than the ingredients themselves. According to Italian American food writer Marcella Hazan, a good pasta sauce is remarkably simple and economical, too, meaning itaposs far cheaper and healthy than any store bought products.  Marcella, who died in , was born in Cesenatico, Italy, in  and went on to open a New York cookery school and write hugely respected cookbooks, so what she says goes when it comes to a good old pasta sauce. In one of her books, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Marcella advises using only three ingredients in tomato sauce: tinned tomatoes, an onion and a generous knob butter. We told you it was simple. The  recipe is still revered by food writers and cooks alike. No chopping is required. And pasta and tomato sauce is always a hit round the family dining table. Marcellaaposs precise instructions are to put half a peeled onion into a pot with butter and tinned tomatoes and to leave it all to simmer for  minutes. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Food publication Delish dubbed the sauce the best in the world. Her husband Victor talked to Epicurious about her efficient methods: Marcella was a genius when it came to taste. She had an immediate understanding about how flavour affects a dish.She asked herself, aposWhy chop an onion  Why saute  Iaposm going to put the onion, tomato, and butter together and forget about itapos. Is it really the best in the world  Itaposs a bold claim and a subjective one. But Italians are famous for their simplicity in cooking. Itaposs all about the produce – tomatoes being one of the most important. No other preparation is more successful in delivering the prodigious satisfactions of Italian cooking than a competently executed sauce with tomatoes, Marcella says in her book.  Her sauce is very rich. Others favour dferent techniques. Jamie Oliver adds four cloves of garlic and garnishes with fresh basil.BBC Good Food recommends starting with a classic mirepoix base , and scores of top chefs use ious herbs and oils and other trickery to elevate their dishes. Anchovies are good. Food writer Felicity Cloake suggests the more classic use of olive oil in tomato sauce. She also puts in a pinch of sugar and some red wine vinegar.The thing to do is experiment. Garlic or no garlic, parsley or thyme or basil or rosemary, as long as the tinned tomatoes are good and thereaposs parmesan on the table, we imagine people will be well fed.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The little lad, who was identied only by his first name, Rayan, fell into the well in the northern hill town of Chefchaouen, Morocco, on Tuesday. His distraught mum said in a video shown on local media: I ask Moroccans to pray for the safeof my son. Rayanaposs father told news site Le he had been repairing the well when the boy fell into it. The rescue mission is complex because the well is  metres deep and gets more narrow as it descends. It starts from -inches in diameter at the top, meaning the rescuers cannot go down themselves to retrieve the child.  The hilly region around Chefchaouen is bitterly cold in winter and though food has been lowered to Rayan, it was not clear whether he has eaten any. Rescuers have also given Rayan water and oxygen through a tube as they continue their complex mission. They are working through the night with bulldozers to cut a massive trench into the hill next to the well.  Once they reach the same depth as the well the rescuers can start digging horizontally to save him, a witness told Reuters. By am GMT on Friday, authorities said there were less than ft of earth left to dig to reach him. Pictures from the scene showed multiple diggers delving deep into the earth from multiple directions. as small crowds gathered on the edge of the ever-growing pit.  State news outlet SNRT News quoted a rescuer on Friday saying the boy was still alive even after being stuck in the well since Tuesday. One of the rescue team told local media on Friday: We are preparing the most critical and most complicated rescue step ...we need to dig horizontally three to five meters.apos But to do so we have to stabilise the earth and remove the risk of a landslide because we will deploy a rescue team and we cannot jeopardise their lives.  Authorities have prepared a helicopter to take the boy to the hospital once he is freed, national news channel M said. Lead rescuer Abdelhabi Temrani told Al Oula television that the diameter of the well was less than  centimetres. News of the rescue mission sparked an outpouring of sympathy online, with the Arabic hashtag #SaveRayan going viral across the North African region, including in neighbouring Algeria. aposThe heart of every Moroccan is with this angel,apos one person wrote on Twitter.The boyaposs fate has also attracted crowds of people to the site of the operation, putting pressure on rescuers operating in dficult conditions, it was said.

Dr Stephen Ansah-Addo, a dermatology resident, was on a flight from Ghana to Dallas, Texas, when the emergency call went out on the tannoy. A pregnant woman, whose name has only been given as GG, had gone into labour prematurely aboard United Flight UA last month. Air stewards then asked passengersa health professional was on-board, and Dr Ansah-Addo and a nurse both sprang into action. The pair turned the area behind business class into a makesht operation room - putting down blankets and towels. Dr Ansah-Addo felt the babyaposs head an hour after the mumaposs contractions became more frequent.  Video footage shows the new mum with her baby boy - after giving birth to him mid-flight. Paramedics were ready to meet the plane when it touched down at Dulles International Airport after an almost -hour journey. Fellow passenger Tiani Warren, , who witnessed the drama unfold from across the aisle, described the birth as a total miracle. She said: I was just having a nap when I started hearing these loud groans from further down the plane. I was really concerned and when I went over to investigate I saw a woman was in labour. It caused a bit of panic, and the pilot was considering making an emergency landing in Bermuda so GG could make it to a hospital. But, as it turned out, there was no time for that, and she had her baby right there and then. Thankfully an off duty dermatologist and a nurse were on board to deliver the baby. I donapost know what would have happenedit hadnapost of been for their professionalism. It was certainly an eventful flight, and Iaposm just so relieved the birth was relatively smooth. What shocked me was when they didnapost have anything to cut the umbilical cord with because scissors arenapost allowed on board - so they used dental floss! The whole thing was just so crazy, but it all turned out okay in the end. I wish GG and her baby boy all the best for the future.

The family, from Ohio in the US, have accused Summa Health System of malpractice, negligence and fraud. The couple alleged the health practice failed to “properly collect” and “safeguard” John’s genetic material. Speaking in a virtual press conference, Jeanine said she and John had been to see a fertility doctor for help around  years ago. She claimed they “couldn’t have been clearer” in their goal, which was to have a child who was genetically related to both of them.  “I underwent the in vitro fertilisation with the understanding that Mike’s genetic materials would be used in this procedure,” she said. The family first learned of the alleged botched procedure upon purchasing a DNA test for Jessica, before she went to Europe in . Jeanine explained the family thought the it could be “cool” for her to connect with distant relatives in the countries she visited.  However, instead of her father’s Italian heritage on her test, Jessica instead found that she was of Irish, English, German, Welsh and French descent. Jessica said there were “no words” to express what she and her parents had been through and claimed she was in “total disbelief”. The organisation has made a statement to local media outlets saying it was taking the allegations “seriously”. “At this point, we have not met with the family or conducted testing of our own. Given the very limited information that we have and the amount of time that has passed, it remains our hope that the attorneys representing the family will work with us to make that next step a priority,” Mike Bernstein, system director of Corporate Communications for Summa Health System, said. Jessica had since tracked down her biological father through ancestry and genealogists hired by her lawyer. It has been confirmed that the man gave sperm for an insemination procedure on the same day the Harveys were in his office. The Harvey family have said they hope their lawsuit will lead to federal oversight of the fertility industry.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace. He’ll be a really good addition. “"},{"url":null,"title":"natural-beauty-history-borders-inspires-photographers","story":"A COLOURFUL image of sheep grazing on the purple heather of The Gypsy Glen in the Tweed Valley has been ranked by VisitScotland as the most popular Scottish Borders social media post of .The photograph by @becky__ received more than , likes when it was shared by the national tourism organisation on its Instagram account, making it the highest performing post of the region last year.An image of Sir Walter Scott’s ancestral home at Abbotsford House near Melrose was ranked second most popular post for the region.

This sparked a furious debate in the House of Commons.No guarantee was given by the Prime Minister that an unredacted report would be made available to MPs.In response Borders MP John Lamont said: “It is deeply frustrating that Sue Gray has been unable to release her full report so that we can see the full facts of what has gone on. The country has a right to see the evidence for themselves and it must be published in full when the police investigation concludes.”MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale David Mundell said: “The document which has been presented by Sue Gray is an update on her investigation into alleged gatherings on Government premises during Covid restrictions. It details a number of alleged gatherings, all but four of which are now subject to a separate investigation by the politan Police and, as a result, details of those events have not been reported in the update in order not to prejudice the police investigations.“My strong view is that, when it is possible, the report in its entirety should be published, as I believe everyone has a right to see what has been established.”Both also insisted that anyone found to have broken the lawshould be held accountable.Mr Lamont added: “No one is above the law. Not even the Prime Minister.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

Their form during the Autumn – which convincing wins over Tonga, Australia and Japan next to one defeat to the world champion South Africans – was encouraging but must be viewed in the context of the performances produced by their championship rivals.England hammered Tonga then beat Australia and South Africa. As well as getting the better of Argentina and Georgia, France also defeated New Zealand in one of the great performances by any nation in any era. Ireland also beat New Zealand and hammered both Japan and Argentina. Even Wales managed to bounce back from a tough series opener when a depleted side lost heavily against New Zealand, to run South Africa close then beat Fiji and Australia.Like Scotland, all four of those teams will approach  feeling that they have managed to grow their player base at the same time as developing squad cohesion through playing three or four tough matches on back-to-back weekends – so we can’t look at any one of those upcoming matches and say with sincere certainty that it is an absolute banker for Gregor Townsend’s team.If Scotland beat England for the third time in five years in this afternoon’s opener then they are up and running, but as scrum-half and vice-captain Ali Price pointed out earlier this week, “that counts for nothingwe [they] don’t back it up”. Next up is Wales a week today, who are struggling under the weight of a huge injury toll which has claimed seven of their British and Irish Lions, so the Scots will fancy that, especially having ended their -year losing streak the last time they visited that neck of the woods. However, an empty Parc y Scarlets in late October is a very dferent proposition to the Principality Stadium in early February, packed to the rafters for a Six Nations match for the first time in two years, and with the home side either fighting for their lives or flying high depending on how their opening weekend clash against Ireland in Dublin has gone. There has been a fair bit of chat during the lead-up to this tournament about how a full-house at Murrayfield will really make a dference for the home team, but you can’t have it both ways – Scotland’s recent away wins are commendable but they were achieved in near silence when it was much easier to stay calm and concentrate. Lets see them do it with a wall of sound coming from the stands.After Cardf there is a rest week, followed by a visit to Murrayfield by France, the tournament favourites, who have the best front-line quality, the most depth and serious form coming into this championship. Scotland’s record of three wins from the last four matches against Les Bleus tells us it can be done, but that performance by Fabien Galthie’s side against the All Black in November suggests that they have now moved on to a new level.Italy away shouldn’t be a major problem. Scotland are now past those dark days of battling against the Azzurri to avoid the wooden spoon. Before we know it, we’ll have reached the final weekend, and the quest for a first win in Dublin since . There’s a lot of rugby to be played, but it will pass like the blink of an eye.Head coach Townsend promised after the Autumn that he would cast his net further and wider than he has done before when picking the players who would compete in this Six Nations . He has been as good as his word.London Irish scrum-half Ben White and Saracens back-row Andy Christie were the two widest leftfield picks. White, aged , captained England at Under-s level and played for the senior England side in a non-cap match against the Barbarians in . Christie represented Scotland at under-s level.The three other uncapped players in the squad are -year-old winger Kyle Rowe,-year-old flanker Rory Dargeand -year-old scrum-half Ben Vellacott .All five of the new faces could feature at some point during the championship – especially the two scrum-halves as Price is the only capped No  in the training squad – but it feels like match-day selection could be pretty consistent as Townsend focusses in on the  World Cup in France, when he will want to have a much firmer idea of his best team and fundamental game-plan than in Japan back in .The big question which remains to be answered relates to who is Finn Russell’s back-up at No . Adam Hastings has been left out of the training squad despite playing well for Gloucester. The logic appears to be to give Blair Kinghorn, Stuart Hogg and Rory Hutchinson training and perhaps playing time at first receiver. But you’d imaged that Hastings will be given a speedy recallthe main man picks up an injury or suspension mid-campaign.SQUADBacks Mark Bennett - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyDarcy Graham - Age: , Position: Wing, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyChris Harris - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: GloucesterStuart Hogg- Age: , Position: Full-back, Caps: , Club: Exeter ChiefsRory Hutchinson - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: Northampton SaintsSam Johnson - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsBlair Kinghorn - Age: , Position: Stand-off, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyRufus McLean - Age: , Position: Wing, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsAli Price - Age: , Position: Scrum-half, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsCameron Redpath - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: BathKyle Rowe - Age: , Position: Wing, Caps: Uncapped, Club: London IrishFinn Russell - Age: , Position: Stand-off, Caps: , Club: Racing Kyle Steyn - Age: , Position: Wing, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsSione Tuipulotu - Age: , Position: Centre, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsDuhan van der Merwe - Age: , Position: Wing, Caps: , Club: Worcester WarriorsBen Vellacott - Age: , Position: Scrum-half, Caps: Uncapped, Club: Edinburgh RugbyBen White - Age: , Position: Scrum-half, Caps: Uncapped, Club: London IrishForwards Ewan Ashman - Age: , Position: Hooker, Caps: , Club: Sale SharksAllan Dell - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: London IrishMagnus Bradbury - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyAndy Christie - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: Uncapped, Club: SaracensScott Cummings - Age: , Position: Lock, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsRory Darge - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: Uncapped, Club: Glasgow WarriorsMatt Fagerson - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsZander Fagerson - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsGrant Gilchrist - Age: , Position: Lock, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyJonny Gray - Age: , Position: Lock, Caps: , Club: Exeter ChiefsNick Haining - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyJamie Hodgson - Age: , Position: Lock, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyStuart McInally - Age: , Position: Hooker, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyWP Nel - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyJamie Ritchie - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyPierre Schoeman - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyJavan Sebastian - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: ScarletsSam Skinner - Age: , Position: Lock, Caps: , Club: Exeter ChiefsRory Sutherland - Age: , Position: Prop, Caps: , Club: Worcester WarriorsGeorge Turner - Age: , Position: Hooker, Caps: , Club: Glasgow WarriorsHamish Watson - Age: , Position: Back row, Caps: , Club: Edinburgh RugbyFIXTURESRound Sat  February, Scotland v England Round Sat  February, Wales v Scotland Round Sat  February, Scotland v France Round Sat  March, Italy v Scotland Round Sat  March, Ireland v Scotland "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13446784.jpg?type=article-full","title":"herald-guide-six-nations-part-4-england","story":"They have two away games to start with, in Edinburgh then Rome, then they are at home to Wales and Ireland before ending their campaign in Paris. Years when teams have three away fixtures tend to be tougher, but England will look at this particular schedule and think thatthey get things right today the whole tournament will start to open up for them.ANY DRAMA Heaps of it. Right now England’s dressing room, metaphorically at least, is littered with more bodies before the tournament kicks off than are usually on stage at the end of one of Shakespeare’s bloodier history plays. Harlequins centre Joe Marchant joined an already y list of absentees earlier this week when he tested positive for Covid, but while he can be expected toto action in the near future, others have longer-term injuries and will play little or no part in the championship. For example, captain and centre Owen Farrell, arguably the single most important member of the squad, has been ruled out because of an ankle injury that has required surgery.Courtney Lawes, who had been favourite to take over the captaincy from Farrell, has been ruled out of the Scotland clash because of concussion, while Jonny Hill misses out with a foot injury. Jonny May looks set to miss the whole campaign because of a knee injury, and another winger, Anthony Watson, has been out since October with a ruptured ACL. Manu Tuilagi, Sam Underhill, Henry Slade and Joe Marler are among the others who have been sidelined by injury or illness in recent weeks, all of which has made for less than ideal preparation. Having said that,there is one side in the Championship with the resources to deal with such dficulties, it is England. And, in the case of Farrell,the skipper’s absence is required before Marcus Smith is given a run in the team, it could even prove to be to England’s advantage. CHALLENGE FOR SCOTLANDAs Gregor Townsend’s team have won two and drawn one of their last four meetings, England may not represent the psychological barrier that they have been for many Scots sides down the decades. But they are still formidable opponents, partly because of their strength in depth, and partly because of the high level of physicality they bring to the game when at their best. Head coach Eddie Jones has not suggested that, rather than playing the home side at their own expansive game, his team will try to play in a tighter, more controlled fashion. The problem then for Scotland would be how to win enough ball to ensure that they can stretch - and hopefully tire out - the English defence.HEAD COACHA complex character who can be by turns curmudgeonly and comical, Eddie Jones already had vast coaching experience before he took charge of England following the  World Cup. He makes high demands of his staff but is also adept at taking a lot of pressure on his own shoulders with the aim of ensuring his players perform in uninhibited fashion.Has won three titles in his six Championships to date, including a Grand Slam at the first time of asking in . Also took England to the World Cup final in . Turned  last month and is contracted until after next year’s World Cup.KEY MANIf Marcus Smith starts at stand-off he could pose Scotland exactly the kind of problems that Finn Russell has been posing his opponents for years. A late call-up for the Lions last summer, the -year-old Harlequins back only has a handful of caps to date but is already a world-class playmaker.PREDICTIONFourth.But, as we saw last year when Scotland won three matches yet only finished fourth, you can have more victories than defeats without even getting into the top half of the table. With this Championship looking even closer to call than last year’s, England may have to content themselves with modest progress rather than achieving a radical revival of their fortunes.  SQUADForwardsAlfie BarbearyJamie BlamireOllie ChessumLuke Cowan-DickieTom CurryAlex DombrandtCharlie EwelsEllis GengeJamie GeorgeJoe HeyesJonny HillMaro ItojeCourtney LawesLewis LudlamJoe MarlerBevan RoddSam SimmondsKyle SincklerWill StuartBacksMark AtkinsonOrlando BaileyTommy FreemanGeorge FurbankOllie Hassell-CollinsMax MalinsJoe MarchantJonny MayLuke NorthmoreJack NowellRaffi QuirkeHarry RandallHenry SladeMarcus SmithFreddie StewardBen YoungsFIXTURESRound Sat  February, v Scotland Round Sun  February, v Italy Round Sat  February, v Wales Round Sat  March, v Ireland Round Sat  March, v France "},{"url":null,"title":"experts-six-nations-view-dean-ryan-englands-chances","story":"THERE won’t be too many neutrals inside Murrayfield this weekend but you don’t have to be a Scotland or England fan to be excited about the prospect of the fly-half match-up between Finn Russell and Marcus Smith. It’s the purists’ dream and you have to hope it lives up to the billing.Marcus was someone who was in the system when I was with the RFU so I would have had an arms- sight of him as someone who was in the pathway. Even then you could see the outstanding potential that he had.I remember being involved in sessions with him where we would try to put ious constraints on him and the speed with which he could adapt to that at such a young age was incredible. So it’s been fascinating to observe his development from then to now with him on the cusp of his Six Nations debut.I’m writing this before the England team announcement and intrigued to discover who Eddie Jones will play at  and  to support Marcus as those are two key positions. You look at Harlequins and he’s got Alex Dombrandt and Andre Esteruizen backing him up. Owen Farrell would have been the obvious choice at no.  – and would have provided both experience and pragmatism - and it is definitely a blow for England that he isn’t going to be available because of injury.Last year’s Six Nations was obviously one to forget from an English perspective with the team finishing fth, something very few would have anticipated. I’m expecting a signicant improvement this year although, with an inexperienced side, I don’t think Eddie will be too hung up on winning this one. Next year’s tournament will be the one where he’ll want England to be fully firing with the World Cup taking place a few months down the line but doing well in this one can’t hurt either. You can never write off England as they’re so strong in resourcesIn my current role as Director of Rugby with Dragons I’ve watched a lot of Glasgow and Edinburgh in recent years and their good form has filtered into the Scotland set-up. You can see Gregor Townsend has a lot of choices there and quality in every position which stems from having two strong club sides.That makes le tougher for England. In the past, winning in Edinburgh was often about how you handled the occasion and the drama but now they have to cope with a squad that is, on paper at least, every bit as good as them.England previously would have travelled north looking to kill the occasion, play for position and muscle it. But Scotland are too good for that now. That would be an unrealistic route to success.This is as tough an opener as England could have had butthey can defeat Scotland before heading to Italy then it could set them up nicely, especially with home games to follow against Wales and Ireland.Having crowds back in general is great for the sport and really adds to the occasion. For England,they can get back to Twickenham with two wins on the board then they’ll look to their fans to back them as they shoot for the Triple Crown. And after that it could all come down to the last day against France in Paris and what an occasion that could be. But a lot has to unfold before we get to that point.I’ve been away from the English set-up for a few years now so am looking forward to this Six Nations primarily as a fan. Last year was obviously disappointing but I still believe Eddie has a strong squad with a lot of talented players andhe can get them playing to the levels that theyre capable of then there’s no reason why they can’t win the tournament. But to do that they’ll need to overcome one of the toughest opening hurdles against a resurgent Scotland and that certainly won’t be easy.As told to Graeme Macpherson"},{"url":null,"title":"strong-lions-contingent-taken-scotland-six-nations-title","story":"Bliss it was to be alive and be young-ish and fit-ish, so that as a fan without typewriter I was able to carry David Sole off the pitch at the final whistle, aided by my big pal Kenny Davis. The victory was gained by a team of underdogs who were really Lions Rampant.That’s a very appropriate phase, I hope, for in what will hopefully be a marvellous coincidence, Scotland could repeat a bit of history involving the British and Irish Lions. For all three Grand Slams secured by Scotland in ,  and , have come in the year after a Lions tour in which Scotland had a decent representation in the Lions squad. Only the  Lions with eight Scots let down the theory, as they finished last in the  Five Nations though they drew with Ireland and lost by one point to England.In the  tour to South Africa by what was then the British Isles touring team, no fewer than ten of the  tourists were Scots and greats like Dan Drysdale, Ian Smith, Herbert Waddell, and Doug Davies played for both the Lions and the Grand Slam Immortals in .In , eight Scots were in the Lions squad, and all eight featured at some point in the four fixtures of the  Slam. Indeed in the final clinching match against France, there were seven Lions in dark blue, with only John Beattie missing out after his injury-hit season.Which brings us to  and the most recent Scottish Grand Slam. One of the Scottish heroes against England on March  – there were  in all – was Finlay Calder, and the previous year he had captained the British and Irish Lions to success over Australia, the Lions coming from one-nil down to clinch the Test series -. There were nine Scots in the that touring party, and in  only Peter Dods did not feature in the Slam.The  Lions’ party coached by Ian McGeechan had the inspirational Calder as captain, with Gavin and Scott Hastings becoming the first brothers to feature in a Lions test. David Sole played in all three tests, while Derek White and Craig Chalmers played in the first test.The Scottish element of the squad bonded with the other nations’ representatives, Finlay Calder pointing out: “All the Scots knew each other well from our training for internationals and the club game back home, but I think it helped build a squad mentality that players were encouraged to room with players from other countries.”History shows that after defeat in the opening test, the Lions bounced back to win the violent \"Battle of Ballymore\" and then clinched the series largely thanks to being gted a try by none other than David Campese.It was the Lions’ first series win since  and the first time since , again in Australia, that the Lions had lost the first game yet came back to win the test series.The Scottish contingent then prepared for the Five Nations Championship of .Finlay Calder never likes to look back, but he is aware that with eight Scottish Lions having toured to South Africa last year, there will be comparisons to the - and - Lions-turned-Slammers, and while pointing to the fact that players gained international experience with the Lions, things have changed a lot since then.“It’s a dferent game now,” said Calder. “Indeed the game we played and the game now are almost two entirely dferent sports.“Back then we were amateurs. We trained as hard as we could but people had jobs to go to. The modern professional game is light years away from the game we played. Most of us from back then would not get into today’s Scotland squad.”He’s being unfair to himself there, but the sheer size and muscularity of modern players has transformed rugby, as has professionalism.Calder is not one of those hankering after the good old days: “The game had to go professional, and I think it was the right thing.“Scotland has been one of a number of nations that struggled with professionalism, and the problem remains that we are not a wealthy nation like England and France.“However, we have what I think of as a cosmopolitan squad with the likes of Johnny Gray, Stuart Hogg and others playing in the English Premiership, Finn Russell in France, and the players at Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors competing at a high level.”Ireland did adapt to professionalism better and Calder names them favourites for what he believes will be a “tight” tournament: “Their provinces have all done well in European competition and of course they beat the All Blacks.“Put it this way,Scotland were to go to Dublin and win I think that would be the result of the tournament for us.”He is hopeful that Scotland can win against England: “We are in as good a place as we have been for some years, and played really well at Twickenham last year.“Eddie Jones seems spoiled for choice in his selection butMarcus Smith is playing then that will be a big ask for him and England. Scotland should certainly feel optimistic about Saturday.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13389797.jpg?type=article-full","title":"livingston-2-1-aberdeen-dons-fans-turn-stephen-glass","story":"Ayo Obileye and Alan Forrest goals saw David Martindale’s impressive Lions move to within a point of the holy grail after a ferocious performance, which at times threatened to blow away the miserable Dons. When your own fans are telling you to “get to f***” and you haven’t beaten anyone not in League Two since the football resumed, it can only be a matter of time before even Dave Cormack loses his patience. A large section of the Aberdeen support seems to have lost theirs in Stephen Glass, despite a late, frantic rally and Christian Ramirez consolation goal. It was another dficult day for Stephen Glass and his Aberdeen teamWith the wind mercilessly swirling and the rain incessantly falling, it always felt like we were in for anything but a celebration of silky football, evenCarnaval de Paris, that great anthem of France , had optimistically snaked its way through the shivering masses before kick-off. At least the Aberdeen fans seemed ready to make an afternoon of it. They were in fine voice from the start, desperate for Glass’ stuttering team to put someone to the sword. But their patience was both required and, as frustrations grew, tested. No more so than when Livingston snatched the advantage just nine minutes in. It had been a bitty affair, crying out for someone - anyone - to get their foot on the ball and show some kind of composure. Ayo Obileye did just that. Predictably, it had been Bruce Anderson who crafted the goal. From the off he was a thorn in David Bates and Ross McCrorie’s side, pulling at their rather loose threads and waiting for Alan Forrest or Cristian Montano-sized gaps to appear, which they did with astonishing frequency. Released by Aberdeen, it was almost like he had a point to prove. After a spell of tame Dons pressure, his clever run into the channel teased Calvin Ramsay into a rash challenge. When the deep free kick was timidly cleared and fell to Anderson’s foot, he shted into space, fired towards goal, and ran off in delight as Obileye flicked it beyond the despairing Gary Woods with all the ease of a man putting jam on toast in the morning. That’s now six goals this season for the robust defender, who excelled again and showed more than once during the match that he wasn’t ready to give up his day job quite yet. As the first-half grew, so too did Livingston. Jason Holt, practically an elder statesman now, was there to mop up any semblance of Aberdeen danger , Stephane Omeonga was a joy in the middle of the park, and Forrest, re-energised in recent weeks, had Ramsay desperately looking around for back-up whenever he motored off down the left. A concerted spell of pressure in the aftermath of the goal aside - and concerted is being kind - Aberdeen were offering little. Glass had rung the changes, three in total, from the Ross County loss, but things weren’t clicking. For swathes of the half they had plenty of the ball in Livi’s final third. But too often a man in red got near the box, looked around for options and saw only a black wall. On more than one occasion, Aberdeen’s attacks ended with the ball harmlessly in the upper echelons of the stand behind Max Stryjek’s goal after a frustrated, wayward shot. Asto sum it up, the half came to a close when the Aberdeen cavalry swarmed Stryjek’s box for a final free kick, only for Jonny Hayes to play it woefully short and to a Livi man. It could only get better. At least the high spirits remained among the travelling faithful, who by this point had swapped the songs for chants of “we’re really bad” - only it was a tad more colourful than that. Within moments of the second-half, however, their jovial spirits turned to indignation and fury. Bruce Anderson impressed against his former sideSome in West Lothian had yet to take their seats again when Montano - one of two Livi changes - galloped in from the left and poked the ball through the heart of Aberdeen’s defence into the path of the onrushing Forrest, who only ever looked like scoring and so it proved. Is it time to throw him into the Scotland conversation alongside his brother at the very least  It might just be. By now the self-deriding Aberdeen fans were baying for Glass’ blood. The boos were loud, the chants telling him to go even fiercer. If there’s a way back from this, it’s hard to see it. A late rally, which saw Ramirez fire beyond Stryjek to give the Dons hope and Livi clear two efforts off the line, failed to spark the comeback he needed as the Lions - who lost Montano for a second yellow following some handbags - somehow held on. "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We gave them a chance to get a goal in front which made things a wee bit dficult and we had to chase it.“They deserve all the credit, we were fortunate to get through and they were really unfortunate not to take it to penalties at least.“I thought we weren’t going to get through .

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

They all have had their own personalities and have brought dferent qualities to the job and I’ve enjoyed working alongside each one.”Another positive change Muriel witnessed was the reduction of the speed limit outside the school to mph.“This really helps,” explains Muriel. “It’s such a busy road, especially with all the lorries coming from Larne so mph at arriving and leaving times is vital.“I’ve had a few near misses with speeding vehicles over the years soeveryone sticks to the mph limit it makes it alot safer for the children.”Although looking forward to her retirement, there are aspects of the job Muriel says she will greatly miss.“I’ll miss everyone I work with and of course the children! “I’ll also miss waving at everyone in the mornings and afternoons because I’ve built up alot of friendships over the years and got to know alot of the parents. I made a great friend through the school, Stella Rea who has sadly passed away, but she was something  and a great lady!“I’ll also miss the children and hearing all their stories and woes! I’ve seen many a fall and tumble and witnessed many games in the playground over the years and can truthfully say I’ve enjoyed every minute.”Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, Mr Jim Allister paid tribute to Muriel’s years of service. He said: “Often schools are valued and judged on the quality of their teaching etc, but equally often the role played by the support staff is taken for granted.“In Muriel we had for decades that invaluable asset of a dedicated partner in delivering the pastoral care and support to our pupils for which Moorfields is renowned.“Not only has she kept generations of children safe in crossing the very busy main road, but she has been that reliable, compassionate point of contact for so many. Through all weathers, Muriel was there to do her remarkable job with the understatement that betokens her caring commitment.“The school is immensely grateful for her decades of service and wish her well in her retirement.”As Mrs Cupples embarks on this next phase of her le away from Moorfields Primary School she was keen to thank all the staff, pupils and parents for their support over the years.“I just want to say thank you to every single one of you who have made my time here so pleasant.

I was interested in engineering, so I decided to apply for a Wrightbus apprenticeship,” said Karsten.“From my time on the shopfloor, I gained a lot of hands-on experience with most parts of the build process and a better perspective of how parts are actually assembled and how they can be improved, which helps me in my current role as a manufacturing engineer.”Wrightbus employee Hannah Currie said: “Learning with hands-on experience made a big dference for me, helping with the progression of my career. ‘The experience working with the time-served tradesmen and women, and having such a iety of technology and buses can help you develop so much more knowledge and skills to help you along the way.

Credit: Stephen HamiltonMark BainTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailCulnady, in south Derry near Maghera, is not a community any more, it’s just a place where people live.Until two years ago it had a primary school. It was a school all the local children attended.Beside it stood a village shop. It isn’t there any more. The old school building sits empty and crumbling. Where there was the laughter and playing of children, the once beating heart of the community has been stilled.The picture can be copied in many villages and townlands across Northern Ireland where the dwindling number of pupils has led to a red cross being marked against the name of the local school.Just across the border in Co Antrim, Duneane Primary School sits surrounded by farmland, a few miles from Randalstown, a few miles from Toomebridge. It has  pupils across two classes. But that statistic doesn’t tell anyone what the school means to the community.It all starts with a rumour. A subtle hint in an otherwise innocuous message. It could come from the Education Authority, it could come to a dferent school.On January  the Education Authority launched a consultation into the future of area planning in education.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDistressing: Duneane Primary School board of governors chair Sharon French.

Their children are enrolled at a bigger school, further away from the community, a safer option to avoid any distressing move once they have settled in with friends and routine.It’s a threat that many schools in rural areas live with every academic year. Some of them believe they may as well hang a sign on the gate reading ‘Dead School Walking’.That’s far from the case at Duneane, where  pupils arrive every day. All classmates, all friends. All the families part of the same community and they want to stay that way.“We’ve been living with a threat hanging over us for years,” said current chair of the Board of Governors, Sharon French.“So many families who live around here have had generations come to the school. It’s what they know. It’s a family. If it goes, it’s gone. It wouldn’t just be the end of the school, it would be the end of so much more.”Every Christmas the little school is packed with mums and dads, grannies and grandads, aunts and uncles, even those with no connection but who live in the area, to see the children take to the stage, to attend Christmas fairs. It’s a gathering point for charity events, tractors runs.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLesley Mawhinney, who oversaw the final year at Culnady. Credit.

Stephen Hamilton“All those things that keep a community together will disappear too,” said Sharon.“It’ll be like a death in the family.”Fellow governor Kathleen McBride feels there are some schools in Northern Ireland which will always be targeted for closure until the day finally arrives.“There’s a seed planted in communities,” she said, “the fear of a school closing, And once that’s there it’s hard to wash away.“Parents suddenly become very wary of sending their children to smaller schools when something like the recent EA consultation is announced.”That, she said, breeds nothing but suspicion.“It looks like the intention is to bring down numbers at smaller schools to make them less cost effective. If that persists for a long time it has a very detrimental effect.“But we need to look at what a school like Duneane brings to a community, not just statistics on paper. What you save in money you lose in spirit. You just need to be at some of the events held in the school to see the feel-good factor it brings. Closing our small rural schools is killing communities. The school offers a chance for people to be together, but the importance of that seems to be lost on those making the decisions.”Duneane had been earmarked to merge with nearby Moneynick Primary School, but those plans have gone silent.“People can number crunch all they want, but in the end it’s the community that suffers,” she added.“Does anyone actually look at the benefits of strengthening a community rather than undermining it  It’s vitally important to hold on to what we have and little support for what we’re doing wouldn’t go amiss.“A distrust has grown at the handling of school closures and that has been killing morale. We hear all the talk of looking after health and wellbeing, but does anyone really think having to work in a school under a threat of closure is good for anyone’s mental health, including the pupils “This consultation is asking schools for solutions. Supporting rural primary schools can be the solution, but you always worry when a public body has to ask people for ideas.”Culnady Primary School closed its gates in . It had educated local children since the late s.Now principal at Maghera Primary, Lesley Mawhinney was seconded in to oversee the final year and a half in the le of Culnady.“The parents still thought they could still save it, but the decision has been made,” she said.“There was a fabulous parent support group, even though there were just  pupils. The community came to everything the school held, Christmas concerts were packed. The local Young at Heart Group for the elderly people in the community supported everything.The spirit around the school was so much more than in schools where there were hundreds of pupils.“Parents went to Stormont, to the Permanent Secretary, to the EA. They really wanted their children to be educated close to home, but there was nothing they could do.The last few weeks were about protecting the pupils, she said.“There was one family who had moved their children from Drumard Primary when it closed. They had to move again, she added.“The hardest part was clearing out and trying not to let the children see their toys being taken out of cupboards, the equipment from the playground being dismantled, even the clocks being taken off the wall.”Around the same time the school closed, the local shop closed too. The community now has to travel to get essentials.“Before we left an elderly gentleman came to the school and brought an old Culnady book,” said Mrs Mawhinney.“His dad, a past pupil, had died the year before and he’d found an old roll book in the attic. There was a photo of his dad and his brother sitting on the wall outside what was the old school, now the Orange Hall. It was the day before his father went to Cyprus in the Second World War. Those stories are disappearing. The history is gone.”For  years Fiona Brown worked at Desertmartin Primary School, a school with  years of history before it closed in .She has cared for ill parents, watched her brother suffer a stroke at a young age, but said the final three years as a principal overseeing the death throws of a school that was the heart of a community was the most traumatic, distressing experience of her le.And the story of Desertmartin Primary shows that even the much vaunted merger of two schools doesn’t always deliver the happily ever after.Church of Ireland run Desertmartin PS was lined up to join with neighbouring Catholic primary, Knocknagin. It would have been the first jointly-run church school in Northern Ireland. The potential merger stayed on the table despite warnings from parents that it wouldn’t work. The churches failed to reach agreement in time.“We knew Desertmartin was unsustainable,” said Ms Brown, “but it was the  hope and the lack of information no matter how many questions that were asked of all those involved that really killed.“The parents think you now more than you do, but the reality was I knew nothing. That’s hard to deal with.“There’s no handbook on how to close a school. It was left to me to tell parents the news. Then it was left to the school to even sources boxes from local supermarkets to pack up.“A lot of toxicity developed over the course of those final three years, and in the middle of that you’re trying to make sure the children get their education. Staff were left unsure of what to do, whether to apply for other jobs. Had they received a redundancy notice we were told they could go on to a list of available teachers, but as we were Church of Ireland no one seemed to realise that list wasn’t open to them. The whole thing was a complete mess.”Ms Brown said she couldn’t face being a principal again and is now in back in a teaching job.“Every time the phone rang I felt physically sick,” she said.“Three years was a very long time to be living through that. Even having to fight to keep our computers until the school closed was problematic. No-one told us what would happen to the records of the children, their photos we had stored. At the very end no-one could even tell us how to, or who would have to hand over the keys to the building.“There seems to be no understanding of what a rural school means to the community.“There as a certain arrogance from those making the decisions. They looked down on us, patronised us as a wee local school and no one took responsibility or had the guts to tell us exactly what was happening.”Back at Duneane Primary, school le goes on and principal Gail Cuthbertson and her staff treat the pupils as they would their own children. It’s that sort of place.“It’s the same for all smaller rural schools,” she said, “there’s always that fear hanging over you.“Schools are about children. Rural schools are about families and togetherness. Remove the school and people don’t know people anymore. What you’re left with is isolation.”There may be platitudes coming about the great work schools have been doing, words like ‘these are very tough decisions’.But the really tough work is with those who battle on through the uncertainty and are left to nurse a community through closure and themselves through a personally draining and demoralising experience while others congratulate themselves on a job well done to balance the financial books.Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of Education PremiumCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’NI head teachers facing ‘chaos’ amid Covid battle and budget cuts, says association chiefWorld-class education system for NI is our goal, says  chairRevealed: Nearly every post-primary school in NI reported Covid outbreak this month PremiumIrish FA chiefs front up and tackle the burning questions as they launch their new strategy - A Roadmap for FootballMost ReadPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastDUP: No Executiveafter election unless ‘NI Protocol issues’ are resolvedA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPSNI in attendance as man dies suddenly in north BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest EducationCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Student numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandNI head teachers facing ‘chaos’ amid Covid battle and budget cuts, says association chiefWorld-class education system for NI is our goal, says  chairMiss NI urges kids to express their feelings in poetryLatestCop’s we on child abuse images chargesJarrod Bowen spares West Ham’s blushes as Kidderminster suffer late heartacheKepa Arrizabalaga saves the day as Cha edge past Plymouth in FA CupIreland v Wales LIVE: Early Bundee Aki try has home side ahead at interval of Six Nations openerSocial media executives could face jailthey do not comply with new rules,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Families that have managed to steer clear of Covid since it arrived almost two years ago are now being struck down by the virus.First, a classmate who is a close contact of a parent with Covid comes to school. Under the rules, they’re allowed to attend as long as they have a negative lateral flow test for  days, but many are going on to develop a Covid infection they then pass on to classmates.It doesn’t help that a child can spend all day sitting next to a friend who later tests positive for Covid — and they are not even considered a close contact.Then, the virus ripples out through year groups. Siblings become infected and, very quickly, large swathes of multiple year groups are unwell and isolating.Professor Ian Young, the chief scientic adviser, said that the highly infectious nature of Omicron meant most schools would be hit by an outbreak,they had not been already.The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that most children are not vaccinated, and there is evidence that previous Delta and Alpha infections do not protect against Omicron.“There is quite a large proportion of under-s with limited immunity,” said Prof Young.“What tends to happenthe virus gets into a classroom or school [is that] it will transmit pretty easily. While [the protections] can reduce the risk, they can’t stop it completely.“There are some schools with quite severe outbreaks and other schools which have had not so much Covid, but sooner or later, most schools are going to have to experience some virus.”So, while we know children are less likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-, it does not mean the impact on their lives is not severe.Even for those children who are asymptomatic, and setting aside the threat posed by long Covid, self-isolation rules are taking their toll on schools.NASUWT national official Justin McCamphill said: “We’re hearing instances where half the school is off with Covid, and then in some schools, it’s half the teachers.“That’s then having a major impact because whole year groups are having to be sent home, and I think that’s being borne out by the absence figures.“That’s causing real anxiety, especially for the exam classes. “I would say this is the worst we have ever seen. It’s becoming impossible for schools to run normal business.”Mental health champion Siobhan O’Neill is also concerned about Covid’s impact in schools.“There have been studies that show really clearly that young people have been displaying signs of stress throughout the pandemic, and young people need their peers to cope with stress,” she said.“They play together to help process that stress. When they don’t get that chance to be together, it does have an impact.“The short answer is there will be an impact on children’s mental health. Most children will be fine, but young people will develop mental ill-health.”Prof O’Neill said this could manest itself in a number of ways, including eating disorders and self-harm behaviours used as a coping mechanism.We know that the negative impact of the lockdowns on children was a major driving factor in reopening schools and keeping them open even as the highly infectious Omicron strain arrived on these shores.But with case rates now so high, when can families and schools expect some respite With , new cases and a further death in a person aged over  recorded yesterday, it is obvious Covid has not disappeared. Yet, Professor Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, is hopeful the situation in schools will begin to improve in the coming weeks.“It’s always hard to predict, but my hope is that we get towards the end of February and start to see cases go down,” he said.However, he warned the removal of other restrictions was likely to result in at least a plateau in the case rate. “The situation is slightly complicated by the end of interventions,” he said.Prof Young is also optimistic that we may soon begin to see a downward trend in case numbers, which will eventually allow more children and teachers toto classes.“We have seen an overall increase in the case numbers of over %, and that’s been largely driven by cases in people aged  and under,” he said.“We have also seen a small increase in adults between  and , and I’m pretty sure those are parents of schoolchildren [because] there is a high risk of household transmission once Covid gets into a household.“There is a secondary peak, and I don’t think we’re over the top yet.“I think that there is a big question over how rapidly it’s going to decline. “It could be relatively slow and, certainly, it could take a number of weeks, but I would expect it to be well declined by Easter.”With Covid expected to continue to circulate at fairly high levels in schools in the coming months, what do the experts believe should be put in place to help alleviate the situation Prof Young said continuing measures such as ventilation, face coverings and vaccination would prove crucial.However, Prof Tildesley said he would like to see face coverings removed from school settings as soon as possible.Meanwhile, Prof O’Neill called for vaccinations to be made available to younger age groups.“There is evidence of increased hospitalisation of children with Covid,” he said.“I’m disappointed that vaccination isn’t available to children, I think, at the very least, there should be that choice so parents can weigh up the benefits versus the risks.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On Department of HealthPolitical instability the last thing NI needs, says business chief Simon Hamilton PremiumScrapping hospital car park charges in Northern Ireland ‘would cost cash-strapped health chiefs almost £m a year’ and could damage patient care, Stormont toldOver £k to be allocated to three mental health organisations in south and west BelfastNewry district tops league table for highest Covid infection rates in UK PremiumIrish FA chiefs front up and tackle the burning questions as they launch their new strategy - A Roadmap for FootballMost ReadPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastDUP: No Executiveafter election unless ‘NI Protocol issues’ are resolvedA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPSNI in attendance as man dies suddenly in north BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three deaths and , new cases reportedNI head teachers facing ‘chaos’ amid Covid battle and budget cuts, says association chiefHealth Minister Robin Swann facing judicial review over treatment of NI care home residents during pandemic‘PM made a mockery of my lowest point’, says Co Down man who stood outside graveyard while daughter was buriedLatestCop’s we on child abuse images chargesJarrod Bowen spares West Ham’s blushes as Kidderminster suffer late heartacheKepa Arrizabalaga saves the day as Cha edge past Plymouth in FA CupIreland v Wales LIVE: Early Bundee Aki try has home side ahead at interval of Six Nations openerSocial media executives could face jailthey do not comply with new rules,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It did not comment when asked about how much of the £.m was intended for bank charges.Mr Lyons said the scheme had been a huge success, with .m cards dispatched, and spending using the cards had boosted the economy by £.m.Related topicsGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyUlster Unionist PartyAlan ChambersMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumViewpointOpinionWorking at home now a viable option PremiumPoliticians question Invest NI handing out £.m to fossil fuel extraction firmsDress to impress: ASOS seeks new NI tech recruitsStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU fundingHigh Street scheme payments to , accounts ‘won’t have to be spent local’Most ReadPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastDUP: No Executiveafter election unless ‘NI Protocol issues’ are resolvedA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismPSNI in attendance as man dies suddenly in north BelfastTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandFamilies vow to get justice on th anniversary of Ormeau Road bookies atrocityCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Family-friendly living in south BelfastDon’t write us off: The rural communities battling to save their schoolsMoneyreagh couple met at coronation party... and have been married now for almost  yearsLatestFamilies vow to get justice on th anniversary of Ormeau Road bookies atrocityQueen’s platinum brooches with a tribute to Philip for her special JubileeCop’s we on child abuse images chargesJarrod Bowen spares West Ham’s blushes as Kidderminster suffer late heartacheKepa Arrizabalaga saves the day as Cha edge past Plymouth in FA Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the numbers slowly dwindled, and by  only three remained — Maggie, Ginger and Furby.The trio, nicknamed the ‘securi-cats’ by former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, made the headlines in  after a number of retired civil servants were banned from caring for the animals.Despite having looked out for their furry friends for years and feeding them every day, they were denied access after being deemed a “security risk”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Thanks to this newspaper, however, the group soon secured freedom of access to the cats once again.In , Ginger and Furbie died just weeks apart, leaving Maggie alone on the estate for the past few years. As the final Stormont cat finally takes her leave, her departure has been described as the “end of an era.”Maggie is of a similar age to Larry the cat, who has served as ‘chief mouser’ to the Cabinet Office at  Downing Street for the past  years.While she may not share the fame or following of Larry’ssocial media account, Maggie is highly thought of by those who knew her.Peter Cardwell, who previously served as a special adviser to the late Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire, said that seeing Maggie as he walked into work always brightened up his day.He added: “I was a huge fan of the cats. I’m a cat person and I took a real interest in them soon after starting at Stormont House.“I remember Stormont collapsing in early . At that time, it was a very serious job and there weren’t too many laughs for a while. “But just seeing the cats and talking about them, they brought a smile to people’s faces.”“I recall having a conversation with James Brokenshire about the cats which Lord Caine, who had been a special adviser to numerous Northern Ireland Secretaries, was also listening to.“We were walking along a corridor and he said he had learned more about the cats in the last  seconds than he had in all his years at Stormont House.”It is understood that Maggie’s departure comes as the Northern Ireland Office prepares to move out of Stormont House and into a new location in Belfast city centre.Related topicsPaul GivanMore On Paul Givan PremiumJon TongeOpinionGambling with future of NI politics will never pay off PremiumSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategy PremiumA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionism PremiumViewpointOpinionCrisis at Stormont means we all suffer PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionDonaldson had no choice, but his risky tactic could backfireMost ReadPaddy McCourt #absolutely denies# sexual assault allegationViral footage shows fridge being destroyed in Holyland area of BelfastDUP: No Executiveafter election unless ‘NI Protocol issues’ are resolvedA measure of support for DUP’s great gamble in the heartland of unionismSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategyTop VideosPlayEast Belfast reacts to First Minister Paul Givan#s resignationPlayVideo: *Graphic content* Iraqi soldiers reportedly executed by ISISPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandFamilies vow to get justice on th anniversary of Ormeau Road bookies atrocityCovid and children in Northern Ireland: ‘It’s becoming impossible to operate normal school business’Family-friendly living in south BelfastDon’t write us off: The rural communities battling to save their schoolsMoneyreagh couple met at coronation party... and have been married now for almost  yearsLatestRussian bombers fly over Belarus amid Ukraine tensionsDuke of York to face interview under oath in London in MarchIreland see off depleted champions Wales to make winning start to Six NationsDavid Moyes relieved after West Ham pushed all the way by brave KidderminsterThomas Tuchel may miss Cha’s Club World Cup campaign due to Covid-,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.It is also true that among the much larger group of voters who are pro Union, but do not vote for ‘unionist’ parties , there was very signicant opposition to Brexit.Therefore, runs the criticism, that large bloc of people who are both overtly unionist in their voting intentions, and who voted to quit the EU, should ‘own’ the current crisis . I have previously written about how unionists in NI did not display any of the nervous reaction to the prospects of Brexit that Gibraltarians did at the time of the plebiscite. The latter had such a sense of their own vulnerability, surrounded by a Spain that feels lasting resentment over the peninsula’s British status, they voted % to stay in the EU.Many of the loudest critics of unionism, and its support for Brexit, hector it for not having seen the merits of the EU and of the single market and for instead endorsing the supposed insularity of little Englanders and so on. My own criticism of unionism in the run-up to the  referendum is that there was a failure to think realistically.The view that Brexit was driven by English nationalism is self-evidently wrong and it confuses two separate issues: the dominance of England within the UK, and the strain of English nationalism.England is dominant for simple numerical reasons: it makes up % of the nation and so will always dominate almost every aspect of cultural, economic and political le in the UK. But there is no proof that English nationalism drove Brexit. England was almost evenly ided, with % of voters opting to leave the EU, and % preferring to stay.The other three home countries of the UK were sharply ided too.Wales had almost a high a percentage of Brexiteers as England, at just under % of those who voted in the watershed  EU poll. In Northern Ireland, approaching half of voters wanted out of Europe.And even in Scotland, almost % of those who cast a ballot in the referendum were pro an EU exit.The UK would have been in deep troubleBrexit really had been driven by English nationalism, and— say — % of England had backed it and only % of Scotland. Instead the UK was unied in one respect: every part of it was split.In  I thought the arguments in favour of Brexit were very strong, but so too were the arguments against. In the end my own opposition to an EU departure was mainly because I felt that it would put the UK in peril .Butthere is a unit in Europe that could operate successfully outside the EU it is the British Isles — and I use the term consciously as a geographical one.If majorities in the four parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland were all happy to live outside the EU then it would be easier to deliver the UK and Ireland as an internal free-trade area with strong links to Europe and America . It is not impossible that such a day will come, depending on how Brexit pans out in the coming years.The big unionist miscalculation in  was the ability to deliver a full Northern Ireland departure from the EU. That was only possible with massive political support for unionism in London. I know people in Westminster who point out that sympathy for unionism now is far greater than it was at the time of the  Anglo Irish Agreement. Even so, it is nowhere near where it needs to be for seismic change like Brexit.I perhaps had a heightened sense of this in  because I had been monitoring developments relating to the legacy of the Troubles.It has been extraordinary to behold themuted reaction to the way in which republicans are being allowed to win the narrative of what happened after .The whole apparatus of the UK state has been turned against itself – a country that saw off three decades of terror and prevented civil war. I remain unwavering in my view that this is a moral collapse both within NI and within the corridors of power in London.While the Republic continues to delight republicans by repeatedly trying to humiliate the UK over legacy in both Europe and the US over alleged past wrongdoing by the security forces, there is still no pressure applied to Dublin, and not so much as a UK demand for an inquiry into the long and stubborn Irish extradition failures of known and fanatical murderers, as a result of which so many people were killed in border areas.Given that enduring weakness towards the Republic of Ireland, what chance was there of MPs standing up to Ireland over Brexit None of this is to say that protocol is even remotely justied. As an opponent of Brexit, I feel all the more resentful over its implementation. I agree with Owen that some unionists seem not to grasp the disastrous implications of the protocol.The belated signs of flexibility from the EU over checks show how much of the Brexit border challenges could have been resolved by EU exceptions being made for bilateral UK-Ireland arrangements.I am just trying to understand some of the reasons why we are in this mess. And we can only hope that the resolve shown by London in overhauling the protocol, which mysteriously began to evaporate in November, s.European UnionNorthern IrelandBrexitProtocolEurope  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularU-turn after Sinn Fein excludes DUP from Stormont leadership meetingBoris’ drinks party antics have stirred more fury than his betrayal of the UnionTUV: We led on Northern Ireland Protocol and the DUP followed after usMy vision for NI’s future as a lapsed Protestant who supports Irish unityBen Lowry: Unionism has been stymied by lack of support in LondonMost PopularWeight loss: can a Lumen ‘metabolism reader’ help you lose weight more easily  How it works of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy Best high street wedding dresses UK :  bridal dress styles for every type of bride - from Coast to AsosBest men’s hiking boots  UK: what to look for in a men’s walking boot, best from On, Berghaus, SalomonBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, Simba, Nectar, Eve, Dreamcloud and OTTY                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comic is optimistic as the pandemic reaches its endgame and feels the speed at which scientists developed a vaccine for the virus was nothing short of miraculousBasically, he has always had a bit of a mouth on him, and has used it to maximum effect - compering the Empire Laughs Back Comedy Club in Belfast for years, a comedy hotspot where Patrick Kielty first honed his craft and also turning up as a regular on BBC NI’s The Blame Game alongside Tim McGarry and Colin Murphy, but his solo material almost always sells out in venues across Ulster, mostly because he is so adept at being an equal opportunities offender, as in, he mercilessly satirises both sides of our historic ide with equal amounts of savage glee.Even while he is able to strut on stage to do standup with nerves of steel, what he calls the “martial art of the performing arts, because it’s just you up there with a microphone, no set, nowhere to hide and you have to be like lightning in keeping hecklers in place”, he maintains that off-stage he is actually a rather reticent character, and while others may have been lamenting the pains of social distancing, he, in fact, “rather enjoyed it.”Father-of-two Jake said: “I have no idea why, and it would take the best kind of therapist or psychologist there is to explain this weird paradox in my personality, but If I walk into a room and there’s five people and I don’t know anybody, I will go into a corner, almost asI am completely socially dysal or some kind of monosyllabic hermit out of their enclave. Then, on the other hand, for some reason I have never felt uncomfortable walking out on stage, be it in front of  or , people. I feel at ease and at home up there and it’s like a dferent part of me taking over, although it’s not asI’m assuming a dferent character, it is very much authentically still me. I just can’t explain that contradiction in me.”He’s been doing standup for over  years now, in all kinds of places,some more down at heel and some more swish, but although the years have made him a pro at embarrassing hecklers into shamed silence, he maintains that comics never lose their fear of completing falling apart on stage, and that in fact it is an intrinsic part of perfecting the ‘martial’ art of successful standup.Jake larking about at home where he has been incarcerated, like many of us, working from home on comedy sketches for YouTube and what he calls anti-social media“Sometimes you can walk into a gig, and for whatever reason, the chemistry in the room or whatever, it’s just not going to work, no matter what you do. I have read, even, about gigs that fell apart for Billy Connolly.A while back a mate of mine named Michael Smiley was compering a gig at a theatre in London and he had seen me doing a lot of political satire and stuff and asked me to go over there and do a show. So I went over and I can’t even remember what joke I began with but I couldn’t even see the audience and they couldn’t see me. It turns out it was a really lefty, sort of right-on crowd, and I can’t remember what I began with, but I completely died on stage.“At one point somebody threw a plastic glass. It was a total disaster and I walked off to the defeated sound of my own feet on the floorboards in silence. That was one of the those gigs where I still wake up at am in the morning in a cold sweat thinking about it.“But it was my fault! You have to gauge an audience and feel the vibe in the room and connect with the people in front of you.”His new show is focused on our response to the Covid pandemic, which has managed to change the world and all of our lives, forever: “At the start of it all I felt like it was actually the apocalypse,” he confesses. “I took to the house, but I was actually thinking of digging a moat around it too. Being a reader, I had read a lot over the years about how bad pandemics can be. I knew all about the Spanish flu, I knew all about the Ebola outbreaks, I knew about the dangers of a flu pandemic, so none of that reading made me feel remotely calm or rational about what was happening.Jake is cute as a button visiting Santa aged approx three alongside his three younger brothers Connor, Barry and Damien. Today he might be pushing  but feels about  at heart. Perhaps a le in comedy prevents ones soul from growing old “But I think because of what we have been through here over the past  years there is a stoicism to the NI psyche, and an attitude where we just go, ‘Right, whatever, let’s get on with it’. Not much shocks us and so we’ve persevered.”‘WHY I ACTUALLY CALL IT ‘ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA’Jake is positive that we are finally reaching the endgame of the pandemic. “I can see an end in sight to the Covid nightmare and it’s all down to the hard work and genius of scientists who developed this vaccine. That they came up with a vaccine so quickly was to me miraculous. But I think a lot of the advances we have made medically are amazing. I can’t wait for the moment when we look back and go ‘Yeah, that was horrendous, but now we know how to respond to something like this.’ “People say ‘Oh, maybe a better world will emerge from this, but I think that’s being a bit idealistic, I mean I think we will always revert to type. “People say we really came together via social media and so on, but I actually call it anti-social media. Online we just peddle disinformation and people’s susceptibility to being conned is frightening to me, I mean people can be swayed into sharing very strange views. The level of mind control that people live under is frightening and there’s this confirmation bias where they find  evidence for their views and just keep going on in a loop.”‘I WAS BORN IN BELFAST IN , SO MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS BEEN STAYING ALIVE’“I was always quick, even at school, I had the quick answer back for the teacher,” reflects Jake O’Kane on his childhood.His family moved around a fair bit during his youth because of the Troubles and north Belfast being a rather precarious area at the time.“I started off going to two primary schools in north Belfast, local dficulties there as I would describe it, meant that I had to move about an awful lot. One school was up in Moneymeena and I went from there to a boarding school in the Republic.“I was incarceratedthere in St Michael’s for five years until I escaped. It had been full of priests, but over time they ran out of them. I was always running south, meaning to head for Dundalk, but always ended up towards Newry. I was good at sports and English and that was it. But because I had so much movement in my early education stage, you know, I missed out on a lot of maths, physics and chemistry and couldn’t get my head around it. I was a painfully shy child.”But as he got older he found himself becoming increasingly sharp-tongued, swt to fire back wittily at those around him and engaging in his secondary school class debates with vigour.“When we did politics they used to set me up to get the argument started with the teacher, to get a bit of craic going. I seem to have a quick brain that way for getting things started or turning things around or seeing it from a dferent angle.”I ask him what the biggest challenge he has faced in his le so far is Without missing a beat he responds: “Well, staying alive. Not dying! And it’s getting harder the older I get. I was born in , the worst time in this country’s history to be born, really. It might have been easier in Darfur or somewhere, I reckon.“So most of my le was about trying to stay alive and that is the ongoing challenge. Isn’t that the case for us all ”It might surprise people to know that as a comedian and therefore a comedy writer, Jake is a voracious reader and is always bemused when doing Zoom calls and people are impressed by the manold titles on his bookshelf behind him: “You can’t write unless you read - the two go hand in hand. If you ask me what my favourite book is it’s like asking who your favourite child is. It depends where you are in le. Dferent books affect you at dferent times. “I’ve a lot of books and I do read a fair bit. I’m not so big into fiction, more history, biographies and politics, and all that stuff. But novels have just never appealed to me.”QA: ‘I ACTUALLY ENJOY HOOVERING THE CORNERS OF CEILINGS AND UNDER CARPETS’Tell us your earliest childhood memories I find it hard to remember what happened last week, never mind when I was a child. I remember being at my granny’s. One morning I got up, we lived in the middle of the Sperrins and my aunt was making bread down stairs.You could smell that coming up the stairs and there was laughter and chat and that was a nice memory.Who makes you laugh the most Billy Connolly.Who is your best friend My we. I’m actually not a very social being, I’m quite an introvert. Covid - everyone has been crying about social distancing, but I find it quite nice.Ideal way to spend a day off I’d spend it with my family and we’d go for a walk somewhere although I can’t get my kids out. They are  and  and they have no interest. My son is always wired into a computer game. With my daughtershe gives me the wrong look and doesn’t want to do something she actually frightens me.I’m coeliac and so I’d like to also maybe order a Pizza Express who are very good at catering for that sort of thing. I eat from there so much I should really be buying shares from the place.Describe yourself in three words Grumpy, short-tempered, kind.Proudest achievement My children. But they are completely mortied by me. What kind of music do you like to listen to in your downtime I have no taste in music which my we has lamented about since we first met. But I was a child of the s so I loved The Beatles.If you could have an ideal dinner party at which you could invite anyone from history, who would you bring Alexander the Great, he was some pup, Oscar Wilde and Gandhi, just so we could have a vegetarian option. I can’t cook, being from North BelfastI ever went near the kitchen my mummy would have beat the head off me and now my we does all the cooking.But I do the cleaning which works out well because I have OCD and it really bothers me when she doesn’t hoover right up into the corner of the ceiling or under carpets, which I find very distressing. We have a clear demarcation of duties which works very well. I love my hoover, you have no idea. If you said to me, you have to get rid of either your car or your hoover then that’s it, the car is gone.See Jake O’Kane’s Maskerade show on Feb  at the McNeill Theatre, Larne Feb  at the Burnavon, Cookstown Feb -, Grand Opera House, Belfast Feb , Canal Court Hotel, Newry March , Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March , Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen and TBC - at The Braid, Ballymena."},{"url":null,"title":"winter olympics  schedule events and how to watch beijing  olympic games in the uk ","story":"It’s time to reset and restore fairness for all: DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson   ‘No DUP collaboration in NI Protocol legal action’: Jamie BrysonNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleWinter Olympics : Schedule, events - and how to watch Beijing  Olympic Games in the UKThe Winter Olympics are underway in Beijing - heres everything you need to know.By Sarah McCann, Search and Trends WriterFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  The Winter Olympics are underway in Beijing, with the city last hosting the prestigious summer event back in .Great Britain is taking  athletes to the Games this year, including three former medal winners.However, the Games have caused controversary, with certain countries ‘boycotting’ the event in a stand against China’s treatment of the Muslim Uyghurs.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

The visit was hosted by the Parliament of Ghana, UK High Commission, and other key partners.We were given a warm welcome and held candid discussions on issues including Covid, conflict and climate matters. We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are pleased to be working in partnership with RSPB NI thanks to financial support from DAERA on this project. Works carried out on site include coner and gorse removal, mowing and rush control, ditch blocking and hedgerow restoration, spoil removal, invasive species management and additional ecological surveys.“Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which waterlogged conditions prevent plant material from fully decomposing and peatland such as Keeran Moss has been accumulating since the last ice age, around , years ago.“Peatlands cover only about % of the earth’s land but they store huge amounts of carbon - twice as much carbon as all the world’s forests. Around % of Northern Ireland is covered by peat, but it is estimated that around % of this is in a degraded state. Due to lack of awareness of the importance of peatlands many sites have been overexploited, damaged by drainage, and mined for fuel. It is crucially important we conserve this important habitat and encourage other land owners to do so.”The RSPB’s Gregory Woulahan explained how the partnership approach to the area was proving beneficial.He said: “RSPB NI completed a Conservation Action Plan for the Garron Plateau in Mid and East Antrim and NI Water delivered extensive peatland restoration works as part of the Co-operation Across Borders for Bioersityproject. CABB is funded through INTERREG VA which is delivered locally by the Special EU Programmes Body. We are really delighted to be working in partnership with the council on Keeran Moss another important peatland site.“Initial surveys at Keeran Moss indicate a range of rare and threatened species including snipe, grasshopper warbler, willow warbler, redpoll, and reed bunting. Restoration works will ensure the peatland is restored and protected so that it could provide a home for other priority species such as hen harrier, curlew, lapwing, and dragonflies in the future.”World Wetlands Day is a campaign to promote the importance of wetlands globally. Gregory added: “A call to take action for wetlands is the focus of the  campaign. It’s an appeal to invest financial, human and political capital to save the world’s wetlands from disappearing and to restore those we have degraded. A fitting day to visit this important local wetland site.”The progress has been welcomed locally too. One resident said: “As a resident in the Loughmourne area of Carrickfergus, I am delighted with the initiative to regenerate the habitat of the Keeran Moss.“I welcome this regeneration project to protect the flora, fauna and bird le from further damage in one of the last bog areas in Carrickfergus. “It has been particularly beneficial to me during the pandemic to watch and listen to the resident and migrant birds on my daily walk, such as buzzards, stone chats, grasshopper warblers, goldfinches as well as seeing hares grazing in the fields nearby.“I feel very privileged to have such a resource on my doorstep and look forward to an increase in wildle here such as newts and frogs, beetles, dragonflies, damselflies and waders like Jack snipe, common snipe and the elusive water rail.

The results each year help build a picture of wildle across the country which is important for conservation efforts. Last year, more than one million people all over the UK counted over  million birds. Setting some quiet time aside to watch your local wildle and get outside does not only benefit conservation and science, but can also be beneficial to your mental and physical health as you will spend time outside, either by yourself or with your friends or family, to concentrate on nature at your doorstep.“These events are part of Council’s #embRACE programme which celebrates ersity in Mid and East Antrim. Delivered by Council’s Good Relations Programme, the initiative continues to develop mutual understanding, respect for cultural traditions, the principle of interdependence and positive cross-community and positive race relations throughout the borough.
