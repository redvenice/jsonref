At the Miami-Pittsburgh men´s college basketball game, Pitt fans tossed purple and gold confetti - Lakers colors - in the air after the Panthers scored their first basket. And before a Serie A soccer match at Olympic Stadium in Rome between Lazio and Spal, Bryant´s photo was displayed on the jumbo video screens.At the PGA Tour´s Waste Management Phoenix Open, the tour joined players with a 16th-hole tribute to Bryant by using his two Lakers uniform numbers to cut the final-round pin position on the stadium par 3.The pin was placed 24 yards from the front edge and 8 yards from the left edge on the rowdy hole that holds more than 20,000 fans. The yellow flag had a 24 on one side and an 8 on the other, and large matching numbers were painted in the grass in front of the green.On Saturday night, Matt Dumba of the Minnesota Wild skated in a 24 jersey - another way of paying homage to Bryant.The NFL also announced that it was auctioning 20 autographed helmets and footballs to benefit The Mamba Sports Foundation. Some of those who autographed items included NFL MVP Lamar Jackson, Peyton Manning, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Ciara and Russell Wilson, Stephon Gilmore, Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, John Harbaugh, Christian McCaffrey, Kyler Murray, Paul Rudd, Deion Sanders, Michael Thomas, and all members of 2020 Pro Football Hall of Fame class.Sherman ended his poem with \u0027We love you, Kobe.

This week’s picture was shot by Gerry Cranham in 1966At the age of just 10, Jack Nicklaus carded 51 for the first nine holes of golf he ever played. By the time of this charming photograph at the World Match Play Championships in 1966, Nicklaus, then aged 26, had become a six-time major winner, the first man to retain the Masters and the youngest ever to complete a Career Grand Slam. He would go on to achieve a record haul of 18 majors in total. What was the secret of his success, you might ask. “I never try to actually hit the ball,” he explained in The Greatest Game Of All … “I try to swing through the ball”. Nicklaus is also fondly remembered for the charity he showed to Europe captain Tony Jacklin at the 1969 Ryder Cup, when he conceded a two-foot putt on the final hole, ending the tournament in a tie. Nicklaus reportedly told Jacklin: “I don’t think you would have missed it but I wasn’t going to give you the chance, either.” Little wonder, then, that when Nicklaus turned 80 last month, the golfing world saluted him as ‘the greatest’.Buy your exclusive print herePrintsPhotographs are presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.

It said it would help Coventry staff with “finding a future” at its stores in north-west Birmingham and Nottingham, approximately 30 and 50 miles away.According to property consultants Altus Group, the departure of Ikea could knock a hole in the city’s finances, as the store is its 11th biggest business rates payer, handing over nearly £1m a year.The IKEA closure is the latest blow to the UK’s high streets and retail sector. According to the Centre for Retail Research more than 140,000 retail jobs were lost last year and more than 10,000 more have been cut since the beginning of January. Department store group Beales and toy shop chain Hawkin’s Bazaar are the latest to have collapsed into administration.Retailers have been hit by a combination of factors ranging from higher costs, including minimum wages and business rates, and a big shift to online shopping.Coventry was one of Ikea’s first attempts at opening a new format, city centre store to respond to the changing habits of its customers. Thousands of people queued up to enter the store on opening day, just before Christmas in 2007, and extra police were drafted in to control the crowds.But its popularity has since dwindled, and Ikea blames the size of the seven-storey building for its higher operating costs and says it has been unable to make the store more cost-efficient or repurpose it.Peter Jelkeby, the country retail manager and chief sustainability officer for Ikea UK and Ireland, said the Coventry closure was not an easy decision, but was it was important for the long-term success of Ikea in the UK.“At Ikea we are constantly challenging ourselves to find ways to meet the needs of our customers and we will continue to try and test, investing in stores, fulfilment centres, city centre formats and our digital capabilities to make Ikea even more affordable, convenient and sustainable.,” he said.In recent years, the chain has trialled opening smaller city centre outlets, on Tottenham Court Road in central London and Bromley in south-east London, to attract a different range of customers who do not travel by car to visit its usual “big box” stores. Ikea currently has 22 UK stores and says it is still focusing on growth, despite what it calls a “changing retail environment”.In January, Ikea bought the Kings Mall, a shopping centre in Hammersmith in west London, which it plans to redevelop, and is understood to be looking for more malls in the UK. The chain already owns 44 malls globally, which it built itself. Ikea said last October it had strengthened its UK property team as it looks to take advantage of bargain prices in Britain’s crisis-hit retail property market to secure smaller and more accessible sites in city centre locations.Ikea’s Coventry store has a prominent position in the city centre. The large and distinctive-looking building will close in the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad98fce3708d8a7041e4c0a1b8c71d5a05db754/0_10_5378_3227/master/5378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ac933f67cb0bb112354250177069a6","title":"brexit referendum immigration trade devolution","story":"Brexit is – allegedly – done. The UK is no longer a member state of the European Union, so in this sense at least, the outcome of the 2016 referendum has finally been honoured. But how done is “done”? And what happens next? While Brexit to date has hardly been easy, a new report by the UK in a Changing Europe shows that much of the real work still lies ahead.First, there are negotiations. These will require trade-offs. The government now faces a choice between aligning with existing EU rules, which will allow for more trade, and regulatory autonomy, which grants the UK national control but makes trade harder. That choice will have consequences.Before those consequences really kick in, however, the government will need to start forming new policies in areas where the EU has played a significant role to date. Among the most obvious are agriculture, environment and immigration. Under Michael Gove’s leadership, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs developed radical policies on the first two, which it falls to his successor to implement. The EU will be looking on anxiously to see whether Britain’s future legislation on these areas signals its commitment to maintaining and enforcing the high standards that EU membership prescribes.On immigration, however, change could be rapid. The task facing the government – devising and implementing a new, points-based immigration system – is challenging and potentially disruptive to sectors that currently depend on a steady supply of labour from the EU.There will also be a simultaneous economic fallout to cope with. Brexit has already weighed on the UK’s manufacturing output and investment, and a bare-bones trade deal could spell trouble for just-in-time supply chains, which require frictionless delivery systems to work. Meanwhile, the apparent decision by the government to prioritise regulatory autonomy means that even a free trade agreement would present new barriers to trade. Tariff- and quota-free trade alone offers nothing for the service sectors, where the UK currently runs a surplus on trade with the EU.The government’s solid majority will end the legislative stalemate of the past two and a half years. Phase two of the Brexit process might prove less consuming than phase one. But the process of disentangling the UK from EU regulations will still demand much time and attention from ministers and civil servants. And the fiscal impact of leaving the customs union and single market will constrain the government’s ability to deliver on Boris Johnson’s promise to “level up” the United Kingdom. More broadly, there is little evidence that the government has a coherent strategy to reshape the British economy after Brexit – its emphasis seems to be on damage limitation on the one hand, and largely symbolic gestures on the other.Brexit has also cast light on the institutional structures of British politics, and questions of representation, legitimacy and democratic reform. Parliament will need to decide if – and how – to scrutinise what the EU is doing after the transition. For the civil service to deal with the next phase of the Brexit process it will need an expanded unit in the Cabinet Office (not to mention that some in government seem keen to bring about far more profound and wide-ranging reforms to the civil service). At the same time, the government’s intention to hold a review into constitutional issues could herald reforms to the relationship between politics and the judiciary.Which brings us to Britain’s territorial constitution. The events of the past three years have placed significant strain on the devolution settlement. Questions over the Northern Ireland border and Scottish independence show no sign of abating. There remains the real, politically contentious prospect of a border in the Irish Sea. After three years without a fully functioning executive or assembly, the newly restored Northern Ireland executive will have its work cut out implementing the NI protocol, and ensuring this is consistent with the deal to restore devolved government.As if this weren’t enough, we live in a country where social values as well as social class drive the electorate. Politics has changed – and will continue to do so. The interaction between values and class will be crucial for the strategies of inidual parties. Can the Liberal Democrats successfully target remainers now remain is now longer an option? Will the Tories be able to maintain their new voters, while winning back more traditional pro-business, pro-European Conservatives who abandoned them over Brexit?There is an awful lot to be done. But we are better placed than we have been in some time to have a serious debate about our immigration system. Brexit may have been the fillip that was needed to address long-overlooked constitutional issues. The referendum and its aftermath may finally force us to confront enduring economic problems, such as a lack of skills and profound regional inequalities. We may be out of the European Union, but Brexit is not, by a long stretch, out of our system.• Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07aef84be23651366c633279ebe61c96e1ed8a7a/168_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a5ed5b53f9c3004c40f603b76f2b6d","title":"coronavirus sars preparedness investment wuhan","story":"Preparedness is everything – so it’s chilling to realise that investment in it is actually being cutMerely a month after a mysterious respiratory illness arose in Wuhan, China, the world is already in the grip of a global outbreak. Now designated a “public health emergency of international concern” by the World Health Organization, and probably not far off earning the more sinister name “pandemic”, the 2019-nCov coronavirus outbreak has already surpassed its cousin Sars in terms of the number of cases confirmed. Although it has a lower fatality rate than Sars, it’s too early to tell whether 2019-nCov will be remembered as something much more frightening.So have we learned the lessons of 2003? Are we now in a better position to tackle and ultimately contain this virus? The answer is both yes and no.Yes, because the Chinese response was relatively swift, open and helpful, compared with 17 years before. The viral DNA signature was determined and published in record time, as were case reports about the illness. Locking down Wuhan and curtailing the mass movement of citizens during a major holiday period look to have been wise moves. But also no, because before coming to its senses the initial government response did hark back to Sars: a kneejerk cover-up, presumably born of an unwillingness to admit that a major crisis could be in the offing. As a result, the scourge went unchecked for days, allowing people to spread the disease widely within China’s borders and, inevitably, outside them. And though its exact genesis is unclear, the virus emerged in the fertile breeding ground of a wild animal market. Despite knowing full well that these places are outbreak incubators, the Chinese authorities failed to regulate them out of existence after Sars. For all we know, they never will.Yet it is wrong to assume that had China only played by the rules this epidemic would never have happened. Viruses do not respect rules, and they do not always act predictably. They have one sole purpose: to create copies of themselves and to pass them on. They have no innate malevolence, but simply the imperative to find a new host in which to survive, as without such protection they will perish. A “hot” virus in a remote village may kill off all of its potential hosts before it has a chance to spread a pandemic virus has to be more subtle.To an emerging pathogen, hosts of a different species present both a threat and an opportunity. Faced with a wild west of unfamiliar tissues and inhospitable docking points, the cross-species incursion is often a very short ride. Yet a potential paradise awaits those that can adapt: an immune system that will give it an initial pass because it has never encountered it before, and an entire population for further onward transmission. Thrust into a crucible of pure natural selection, the virus can throw off millions of slight mutants of itself in the hope that one of them will “stick” – allowing safe passage into accommodating tissue, subverting our cells into dutiful photocopiers, tickling the lungs into coughing fits to propel its progeny towards the next victim. Viruses can mutate in real time: the Wuhan virus, which at the moment has not moved far beyond those intially exposed to it, may at any point become more virulent.You also don’t need a wild animal market to stumble across a new pathogen. As we slash through virgin forests, we will rub shoulders with animals that have never seen humans before (bearing viruses that are similarly naive). As our planet warms, melting permafrost could release viruses held in stasis for millennia, and disease vectors will push into territories once too cold for them. Our ever-increasing appetite for global travel, and the growth of super-cities, will amplify the number of chance encounters, many of which, in a less complex era of fewer people, would have simply burned out.While it is almost certainly the case that there will be more frequent coronavirus outbreaks in the future, it’s impossible to know which viral class will cause the next Big One: our old nemesis influenza, a retrovirus like HIV, a haemorrhagic virus like Ebola, a flavivirus like dengue, West Nile and Zika – or something entirely unknown to science. This is why we must avoid the temptation to put all our eggs in one basket it would surely be a mistake to blow the budget on coronavirus research when the next thing may well turn out to be something entirely different.As we can’t predict which pathogen will give us grief, the most important thing we can do is to invest in preparedness itself. Don’t get me wrong: great science is compelling stuff, and I’ve been impressed with how quickly the scientific community has responded. Advances in so-called DNA vaccines circumvent the need for virus isolation and biological experimentation: all you need is the blueprint, and you’re good to go. Within days of the Chinese sequencing the virus, a number of labs used the published code to start crafting a vaccine based on genetic material. It’s early days, as no DNA vaccine has yet been licensed for use, but it’s clear that in a relatively short time this technology will become a lifesaver.But as amazing as our science has and will become, it is probably public health and prevention that will do the lion’s share of keeping us safe. Worthy, boring activities such as legislating against situations where people can come into contact easily with exotic animals increasing the availability and uptake of hand sanitisers developing more effective mass-produced masks enhanced port-of-entry surveillance incentivising open communication about outbreaks in cultures in which such candour is problematic getting better at hospital management, triage and life-support of the critically ill.We can only hope that the lessons of Wuhan will be learned in a way that those of Sars were not. For we are all linked, developed nations and developing, democracies and dictatorships alike. Viruses know no borders and respect no ideology: only openness, cooperation, readiness and plenty of money can keep them at bay.• Jennifer Rohn is a cell biologist at University College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bc18d23ac1f56d55270cafb0ac0da21670d5a3/0_116_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5048f7301d6e81e28ad7a1215406552e","title":"south african photographer santu mofokeng in pictures","story":"The documentary photographer, best known for recording everyday life in the townships of South Africa, has died.

The picture was taken by Jean-Baptiste Mondino in Paris in 1989 and styled by Judy Blame. We had done a photo session for my single Manchild, with the boxing bandages and the jewellery, and when we needed to shoot the cover for my debut album, Raw Like Sushi, we thought: “Let’s work some more with that.”We had a bunch of rails with things to wear, but Judy and I had been to Printemps – like a French version of Marks \u0026amp Spencer – and I had bought a nice bra, and I was wearing leggings, which were from Pineapple or somewhere. I went out to test the light and Mondino was like: “Don’t put anything else on. Maybe some more jewellery.” Then we did the picture that ended up being the album cover. In the same session I wore some BodyMaps shorts, which are in the pictures that ended up on the back and the inside, but it was a really non-wardrobe thing in the end.I have always felt that visuals are a very important part of telling a story. For a woman, this was quite a male visual. The boxing wraps were a metaphor for being here to fight the fight.In 1988, I had just come back from Jamaica when I performed on Top of the Pops while seven months pregnant. I wore some dollar-sign earrings I had bought while I was there and snakeskin trainers. Judy would pull things out for me to wear – people like Rifat Ozbek. He always had his hand on the pulse.

It’s certainly my experience, but why is this, and how to avoid it?Ian, Ystalyfera, Swansea ValleyIan’s question was prompted at least in part by a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe in Feast last autumn for rye pancakes (to go with crispy duck, British-style) in which he admitted that, while the batter mix was ostensibly enough for 11 pancakes, “the first few attempts aren’t usually the best”, so it’s best to plan on getting only eight out of it. If even our culinary idols have issues with the first pancake or three, Ian wondered, what hope is there for the rest of us?“There’s no harm in just accepting that the first one will be bad, eating it there and then, and moving on to the next, better one,” says Henrietta Inman, chef at the newly opened Stoney Street in London, whose breakfast offering, in particular, has got the Instagram crowd snapping away like mad things. “I’m not entirely sure of the science behind it, but it’s all about creating a seal, getting the pan used to the mix and warming it up for the rest.”There are, though, a few tricks that may reduce the risk of first-pancake hell. According to restaurateur and food writer Bill Granger, one is not to overmix the batter. It might seem counterintuitive, he says, but “you actually want to see tiny lumps of flour in it – they’re a good sign that the end result will be a tender pancake, rather than a gluey one, because they show you haven’t overworked the gluten”.Granger is more responsible than most for changing British attitudes to breakfast and brunch, so take heed – he began spreading the word here as long ago as 2000, and a decade later put his money where his mouth was with the UK’s first branch of his Aussie chain, Granger \u0026amp Co, in London (he now has four here, and 14 others worldwide, from his native Sydney to Japan, Hawaii and beyond). Once the batter is made, he says, give it a rest: “Just 20 minutes, so the gluten relaxes. And, obviously, the more you’ve mixed it, the more time it needs: generally speaking, thin, crepe-like pancakes need longer than thicker ones, such as our ricotta hotcakes at the restaurants, because the batter tends to be worked more.”Inman, however, isn’t so sure a rest makes that much of a difference: “I’ve cooked them with fresh mix and day-old mix, and they’re just the same. I think it’s more important to get the batter to the right consistency, which for a basic pancake means not too thick and not too thin.”Of course, the pan plays a big part, too, Granger says. “Put it on medium heat before you add any fat, and for long enough to get an even heat distribution.” That’s because, when you heat metal, it expands, and you need the fat (with pancakes, that usually takes the form of butter) to fill any pores in the surface, or the first lot of batter will do so instead, which is why the pancake sticks and tears. Be wary of using too much, though, or the batter will simply soak it up, leaving you with a grease-sodden initial attempt. Treat it less as frying and more as seasoning the pan (much as you do a wok with oil), and you won’t go far wrong.“Brush the entire surface with butter,” Granger says, “then wipe away any excess with a bit of kitchen paper and add a touch more butter, just to be on the safe side.” When you now add the batter for that tricky first pancake, the pan ought to mimic the well-greased one you normally get when making subsequent ones. “In restaurants, the pans are used so much, they’re always well seasoned, but that’s often not the case at home.”At the end of the day, Inman says, pancakes are like any other kitchen skill. “You’ve got to get a feel for it, as we do with all the ingredients we cook with. It’s all about practice – and about not being defeated by first attempts that go wrong. That’s something that happens to everyone, however experienced.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Sign up now!While assorted Liverpool players and their nearest and dearest have been raising brand awareness by posting #content of themselves either at, or on their way to various warm-weather holiday destinations around the world on FaceSpace, Instachat and TokBook, the current whereabouts of their manager remains unknown. Having announced immediately after his side’s FA Cup fourth-round draw at Shrewsbury that “it will be the kids who play” in the replay, Klopp assured reporters he would not dignify it with his presence either. He was subsequently accused of disrespecting both Shrewsbury and the grand old competition.On the first charge he’s bang to rights. On the second, not so much. After all, the FA can hardly complain about the Cup’s integrity being eroded when the fifth-round draw was conducted on a Monday night episode of a light entertainment programme that also featured an interview with Donna Air, some shameless BBC cross promotion for a TV drama about a family of sisters working as orce lawyers, and the eagerly awaited announcement of the results of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds’ Big Garden Birdwatch. As the great Mel Brooks once famously said of The One Show – while appearing on it – “This is nuts!”Although neither Liverpool’s regular starters nor manager will be showing up at Anfield, the team’s supporters will be out in force. Earlier on Tuesday, the club announced that all their cut-price tickets have been sold and urged anyone who doesn’t have one to follow the lead of their senior players and not travel to Anfield. Once the 54,000 who do turn up manage to tell the players selected by stand-in manager Neil Critchley from the mascots accompanying them out on to the pitch, an intriguing game between the whey-faced cream of Premier League academy talent and some older, wiser and more gnarled League One bruisers should unfold.While Shrews manager Sam Ricketts claims to understand Klopp’s reasons for sending out the kids, he has been grumbling about the loss of earnings his club will ship on the back of slashed ticket prices and an absence of TV revenue. “‘Let’s say we walk out with £150,000 off the back of this replay,” he said. “But if it was a full-on game you’re looking at half a million and another £72,000 from television.” His complaint is understandable but slightly disingenuous, as there is no guarantee that Anfield would have been anywhere near full if ticket prices had not been reduced, no guarantee this game would have been televised even if Klopp was fielding a senior side, and no guarantee Shrews would have got a replay if Klopp had fielded a better team first time around. It also seems to have escaped Ricketts’ notice that by playing Liverpool’s Kindergarten XI, Shrewsbury’s chances of advancing to the last 16 – and trousering the accompanying £180,000 in prize money – are hugely increased. With a lucrative trip to Stamford Bridge up for grabs, Sam’s Shrews will make a nice few bob however things unfold.Join Barry Glendenning from 8.05pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Oxford United 2-1 Newcastle United.“I can’t see that our accumulation of points over the past seven months of the Premier League is luck.

They don’t need to get their hands dirty, either – finance, service and sales have apprenticeship roles tooFor petrolheads, opportunities to work with cars, in cars and around cars are extensive. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), more than 823,000 people are employed across the automotive industry, including 168,000 directly in manufacturing, while more than 30 manufacturers build in excess of 70 models of vehicle in the UK, dreamed up and created by some of the world’s most skilled engineers.But for most car fanatics, behind the wheel is where they want to be. One option for adrenaline junkies is to become a stunt driver. To do this most candidates go to a stunt driving school then serve as an apprentice in a team, learning from the best and working their way up until they become an expert themselves.If it’s size rather than speed you’re after, how about becoming a lorry driver? According to The Knights of Old Group, which offers lorry driver apprenticeships, a national shortfall of 45,000 drivers means you’re unlikely to be out of work. Training involves everything from driving techniques to vehicle preparation as well as the environmental impact of the industry and will take you up to the role of a Cat C (Rigid) driver.If that sounds a bit lonely, bus driving could be the way forward. According to Youth Employment UK, you can get into this by completing a bus driving apprenticeship, usually known as a passenger carrying vehicle driving apprenticeship. According to the government website there are apprenticeships available in several sectors of the transport and logistics sector, including passenger transport drivers.For car connoisseurs who don’t fancy getting behind the wheel, most major manufacturers offer engineering apprenticeships, including the likes of Rolls Royce, Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin Lagonda. For those after a hands-on role BMW, which has its own academy in Berkshire, offers motor vehicle technician apprenticeships as well as bodyshop and motorcycle apprenticeships. Equally Ford, which also has its own Henry Ford Academy, offers engineering apprenticeships while Jaguar Land Rover offers advanced apprentice programmes in both manufacturing and engineering. The possibilities are endless, with an apprenticeship proving a springboard for many into a long-running career in the automotive industry.But for those who don’t want to get their hands dirty, major car companies are also offering apprenticeships relating to other areas of the industry – Ford’s apprenticeships include higher apprenticeships in finance and IT, while BMW’s include customer service and sales. Ford offers dealer apprenticeship opportunities across everything from car technicians to sales executives, with a range of programmes from 12 months up to three years combining hands-on training with college study.Such is the popularity of apprenticeships that in 2016 the Automotive Apprenticeship Matching Service was launched by major manufacturers, allowing companies to connect rejected applicants with schemes run by other manufacturers and in turn close a skills gap in the sector.Whatever direction you want to take a car-related career in, it’s just a case of deciding which route to take.Shay Chuplis, 20, completed an apprenticeship at a garage in London. He now works as a mechanic for the same employer who trained him. As told to Abby Young PowellI have always been interested in cars and wanted to learn first-hand how they work. The way I see it, being a mechanic is like being the doctor of a car. An engine has so many different parts and you have got to know everything about them.I thought I knew about cars before I started, but when I got here I realised I still had a lot to learn. That was a bit of a shock.I worked four days a week and studied at college one day. On an average day during my apprenticeship, I would do quite a lot of services, like changing the oil and filter in a car. You get a lot of old cars – dying cars, as I call them. Sometimes we also have an old classic Ferrari, Jaguar or Porsche come in. I also answered the phones and spoke to customers. I have always been a people person and you get to know the regular customers and have good conversations with them. You build up relationships and see a few characters.It was good to have a mentor. They were helpful and taught me how to do things. There were a few other apprentices here at the same time as me, too. Most apprentices come through the same college, so we already knew each other and went to the garage together. It’s good because you get to make friends and it is nice to work with people you can have a laugh with. I wish I had known how hard it can be at times too, though. In the winter it is cold and you can hurt your hands, but I guess that’s part of the job.I’ve learned so much. In the beginning, I would sometimes run away from jobs because I wasn’t confident. Now I am fine on any car. I can diagnose the problem and do jobs with my eyes closed. You learn more in three months in a garage than you can in a year in college. I feel proud that I know my trade. At the moment I am taking a break from studying to work at the garage, but I plan to do another level of training here.£64bnUK manufacturing industry turnover in 201478,000People employed in the UK automotive supply chain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29485a681aece9e0a950b3b283747638d0a8309/0_702_6184_3711/master/6184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfd6d19609445c9ea26fcfdd9c6beb","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

But a relationship needn’t be entirely bad for you to want to let it goAfter a health scare 10 years ago, my father was baptised into an extremely conservative, fundamentalist Christian church. My older brother joined him shortly thereafter and after years of living with the threat of hellfire and damnation, my mother joined as well. I have attempted to keep the lines of communication open with them, to try to understand their perspective of the world, but their impossible standards mean my relationship with them is shattered. I am 36, married, have two children and own a small business. All of this to them is “worldly” and a barrier to me having the “right” relationship with God. When is the time to sever the cord with the parents who once meant the world to me?That’s a lot of hurt and anger in a few lines. But the part of your letter that strikes me most deeply isn’t your understandable hurt and anger. It’s that you say your parents once meant the world to you. It makes me wonder whether you’re hesitating because it feels too severe to cut the cord with them, like you’d be serving them the sentence we use for abusers or toxic manipulators, when your parents are just the people who once felt most like home.I wonder whether saying “enough” feels so harsh that you’re waiting for someone else’s permission to really feel the things you write: that you’ve tried to save the relationship, that it’s exhausted you to try, and that it might be a relief to cut the cord. Maybe it feels like that still isn’t enough to legitimate walking away from a relationship when you know it once contained so much good.But letting someone go doesn’t mean letting go of all they were to you, or all the good there was between you.It can be hard to see that, in the throes of breaking apart, because we often turn to anger to fuel our escape velocity. And anger moves in the fast, urgent way we need in order to get out. We cast other people as monsters. We chew off our friends’ ears with the next instalment of “can you believe what they said next”. If we’ve been lucky enough to have had relationships with some good in them, somewhere in the molten core of our exit-rage we know that anger isn’t telling the whole story. Somewhere we still remember the birthday parties and the moments of tenderness and the little rituals we shared before things went wrong.If we’re not careful, though, we can get stuck believing that only one of these stories can be true, and then endlessly ride the pendulum between thinking anger insults the memories of tenderness, or that our memories of tenderness insult our righteous anger. In fact the challenge is to let ourselves feel both. This may take months or even years and what waits for us when we finally manage it is just the deep pelagic grief of having to let go of something that wasn’t entirely bad.But almost nothing is entirely bad, and your relationship doesn’t need to be entirely bad for you to want to let it go. It will be hard, if you decide to. When we let go of things that had a little good in them we tend to leave fingernail marks behind. But we put our present selves through that pain because we think that what we’re doing is a service to our future self, and that’s enough. You don’t need any permission beyond that. Not even your parents’.Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with? Eleanor Gordon-Smith will help you think through life’s questions and puzzles, big and small.

Though he lived most of his adult life in Germany, he was born in Argentina, and in an important sense he remained an outsider.He was a leading member of the European avant garde but always seemed slightly apart from it, satirising its conventions and conceits while consistently blurring the boundaries between what belonged in the concert hall and in the theatre.Yet his works remain little known in Britain, certainly compared with those of some of his contemporaries. But the latest concert in the London Sinfonietta’s Turning Points series was devoted exclusively to Kagel – solo instrumental and ensemble pieces, mostly from the 1960s and 70s, one of his films and some music theatre, though almost all his works contain some element of the theatrical.Tim Hopkins had directed the evening, and began it himself as the protagonist of Présentation, in which an oleaginous compere makes a series of increasingly deranged attempts to introduce a famous chanteuse who resolutely refuses to appear, while a pianist (Fali Pavri) fills in with robotic, vamp-till-ready accompaniments. Pavri also played the evening’s nearest thing to a conventional concert piece, the solo-piano À Deux Mains, while the tuba player Stuart Beard gave startlingly vivid performances of two classic examples of Kagel’s instrumental theatre, Atem and Mirum, the second of which ends with the player delivering the words of the Tuba Mirum section of the requiem mass.Match, in which a to-and-fro “game” between two cellists (Tim Gill and Joely Koos) is refereed by a percussionist (David Hockings) is one of Kagel’s best-known works, but it was also good to see again the film Antithese, with its electronic music soundtrack and surreal, Buñuel-like cinematography, in which a sound engineer is overwhelmed by the technology he’s supposed to master.Typically for Kagel, the most outwardly conventional piece in the programme was the most disquieting. Fürst Igor, Strawinsky, written for the centenary of Stravinsky’s birth in 1982, is a setting for a bass (the appropriately dark-toned Jimmy Holliday) and ensemble of a section of text from Borodin’s Prince Igor. They are delivered in measured solemnity, but then a white-clad figure appears, tapping a piece of wood with a mallet. Quite baffling but haunting, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81993fdd8b2b80449dc3ccb85de285cfd06c59a/0_182_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=accffafdc1cee092a7c08a09ce1dc14e","title":"us elections the importance of iowa podcast","story":"Chris McGreal visits the first US state to vote in this year’s race for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination.

We will show everyone that our culture is open, respectful, creative and engaging,” he said.Starmer said he would like to abolish the national constitutional committee, which deals with complaints against Labour members, and instead establish a fully independent process.That has long been a demand of campaigners against sexual harassment and antisemitism in the party, some of whom have claimed their cases have been kicked into the long grass.The Bristol MP Kerry McCarthy raised a complaint of inappropriate behaviour against Kelvin Hopkins in November 2017, and the case remained unresolved two years later when he stepped down as MP for Luton South in the run-up to last year’s general election.Labour remains under investigation by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission over its handling of antisemitism.Starmer would also like to remove the power of the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) to impose candidates in the run-up to general elections, he said.Some constituency Labour parties (CLPs) complain that the NEC has too much power over shortlisting and selecting candidates – which led to a series of spats last year after the election was called.In an attempt to make Labour’s candidate-base more erse, the shadow Brexit secretary said he would like to see Labour press for a change in legislation to make all-BAME shortlists legal, and to set up bursaries to help meet the costs of standing for election for underrepresented groups.He will set out his plans in more detail in a video call with supporters on Tuesday evening.

Chloe Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, defended the briefing as a normal way of informing some journalists about specialist technical subjects, in addition to routine lobby briefings to be held twice daily.Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative father of the House of Commons, advised ministers that there was a “problem” which needed resolving with the media, although he said the behaviour of New Labour spin doctors was worse.“I do believe that it would be sensible for the government to consider having a talk to the senior political editors who did walk out and see if there’s a way of getting over this problem and resolving it,” he said.Bim Afolami, another Tory MP, asked the minister to ensure “briefings are done in a sensible way with the agreement of all members of the lobby over the longer term” and that the Commons should be committed to “no political interference in the media as that is a foundation of our democracy”.Opposition MPs were even more critical. Brabin said: “The ability of the lobby to have access to briefings without favour is a longstanding tradition and one that is vital to the health of a functioning democracy … What was the selection criteria and if that decision was made by a special adviser, are they in violation of the code of conduct of special advisers and the civil service code?“The government’s behaviour in these matters threatens the civil service’s core values of impartiality and objectivity. It also brings into question the integrity of future government-media briefings and the conduct of its special advisers and damages a free and vibrant press.”Pete Wishart, an SNP MP said the minister’s attempts to defend the selective briefing were “woeful and desperate” and “would make Comical Ali look like a Pulitzer prize winner”, calling it a “black day for press freedom”.The government’s actions have been condemned by the Society of Editors and the National Union of Journalists.Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership candidate, has also written to Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, asking him to urgently investigate what happened and whether government officials are being politicised.He warned that the decision to exclude some of the media from a briefing with David Frost, the government’s chief trade negotiator, had “undermined the civil service’s ability to comply with its core values of integrity, objectivity and impartiality”.Frost is a former senior civil servant who was made a political special adviser under Johnson but a previous briefing on security was conducted by intelligence and security officials bound by the civil service code.“The actions of the prime minister’s director of communications, whois a political appointee, are deeply disturbing,” Starmer said. “I am concerned that they have undermined the civil service’s ability to comply with its core values of integrity, objectivity and impartiality. Equally, banning sections of the media from attending important briefings about important matters of government is damaging to democracy.“For instance, the government’s post-Brexit trade plans are matters of national importance. The media’s access to the prime minister’s chief negotiator should not be determined by political favouritism.”Earlier, Michael Gove, a senior cabinet minister, refused to comment on the decision or say what he as a former journalist would have done in the same situation.He told Sky News that he did not know the full circumstances but he was sure the dispute could be sorted out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b4fc83a6b3a2ee956c017f77967906c2f1fad8c/0_108_3244_1946/master/3244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6db4a47cbded5aaeb3acc9f9f88b954c","title":"mindfulness in the mountains does your winter holiday hold the key to wellness","story":"Research shows that skiing not only improves fitness and tones you up, it also boosts your mental health. So book your winter holiday to the mountains safe in the knowledge that you’ll return home healthier and happierNo matter how much time you spend on the slopes, the pleasure of being in the mountains never gets old. Emily Sarsfield, skier and Olympic ski cross athlete, says: “Skiing makes me feel peaceful, relaxed and at one with myself. It’s almost like dancing – it’s unreal.”When Sarsfield isn’t skiing competitively she shares her passion for the sport through private ski instruction. Accustomed to stilling her own nerves ahead of global competitions, she’s ideally placed to bring some mindfulness to her lessons. “When I’m teaching, my clients sometimes get stressed and fearful. I’ll stop and encourage them to take a moment to take a few breaths, soak up the views, absorb the calm and remember why we’re skiing – to explore this beautiful world – and those fears invariably disappear,” she says.It’s a sign of the mindful times that resorts and winter sports companies are increasingly catering to those eager to combine skiing and boarding with erse non-ski activities, from dog-sledding and ice-climbing to outdoor yoga and qi gong. In response to demand from its clients, the all-inclusive Club Med is launching a new initiative this winter at properties in France where guests can swap half days spent on the slopes for wellness experiences such as yoga, swimming and spa treatments.It’s a trend that Rosie Cardale, a qualified physiotherapist, yoga and pilates instructor, has experienced first-hand while working in the French Alps. “Incorporating physio treatments, yoga and pilates classes into ski holidays is fast becoming the norm for many holidaymakers,” she says.“My clients, who range from veteran skiers accustomed to regular physiotherapy and yoga at home, to infrequent skiers seeking to recover from an injury quickly, consistently report feeling more energised and stronger, both physically and mentally, after time spent in the snow.”According to Cardale, setting aside some time for mindfulness is actually the secret to getting the most out of your winter holiday. “Find some downtime to fit in some gentle breathing exercises – ideally in the warmth of your hotel or chalet or even on a long chairlift. It can do wonders for your body and mind,” she says. “And if you get a chance in the evening, stretching will really help you to make the most of the next day on the slopes.”Finally, if the stress still creeps in while you’re on the slopes, just remember Sarsfield’s mantra: “If you’re lucky enough to be in the mountains, you’re lucky enough!”Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cfb76265d34c6243019f32b58347f34c2dfaf8/0_162_5050_3030/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85bcfb928e77bc3260bce40c979d2859","title":"leap day 2020 do you have special plans","story":"Share how you will mark the first February 29 falling on a Saturday since 1992 2020 is a leap year, which means we’ll have a 29th of February, also called Leap Day.

These four dreamers are from a different placeSome Olympic sports athletes live in a world of certainty. They know they’ll make the team. They have steady incomes within their sports, with ample access to any resources they need to compete. The following four athletes don’t dwell in that world. They have a delicate balance of work and sports in their quest to earn a trip to the Olympics that is far from guaranteed.Pitts’ pursuit of an Olympic track and field berth has been made possible in part by a surprising activity.No, the 5ft 8in triple jumper from Louisiana State University hasn’t changed sports to try something that isn’t on the Olympic radar. She has just trained a couple of rodeo athletes, all part of the employment scramble that has kept her going in the sport more than five years after graduation.“Their main thing was getting off the horse and running to the calf,” Pitts said of her rodeo clients. “You have to think outside the box. We don’t have a horse we can train on all the time.”Pitts is employable, having graduated from LSU in 2014 with a degree in kinesiology and a minor in psychology. She has trained athletes, not just in rodeo, who have a need for speed. She also has worked as a personal trainer in a retirement community and as a career counselor in middle schools.And she has been the bearer of bad news for a few people.“Being a career coach, I’ve had to crush a lot of dreams,” Pitts said. “Sometimes, unfortunately, I talk people out of being a professional track and field athlete.”Pitts isn’t being mean. Just realistic. She knows how tough it can be to stay in the sport without top-tier USA Track and Field funding, big-time sponsorship or the prize money offered at the world’s best meets.But she’s able to keep expenses down most of the time. She’s able to use the facilities at her alma mater, where she works with Boo Schexnayder, one of the coaches in the powerhouse LSU program.She also doesn’t travel much for competition. LSU hosts a couple of meets each year, including an indoor meet that usually kicks off her competitive year in January. (She tends to win.)For national championships, she can qualify for “pre-allocation” money if she gets the right results beforehand. For other meets beyond Baton Rouge, LSU’s home city, she usually pays her own way.Medical bills are also a challenge. She has phased off her parents’ insurance and gets Medicaid, but she had to pay a lot out of pocket to have ankle surgery to deal with bone spurs.Given all these obstacles, she has had the passing thought of taking her own career advice and choosing another path, especially when she balanced training with a job that kept her on her feet all day.“Boo even asked me, ‘How are you doing this physically?’” Pitts said. “I was working 32 hours a week and doing track and field. I was just coming back off surgery. I was frustrated with my marks.”Still, she has made some national teams, thanks to a series of fourth-place finishes in the US championships. She hasn’t been to the Olympics or world championships, but she has competed in the NACAC (North America, Central America and Caribbean) championships a couple of times. She took third in the 2015 NACAC meet with an official personal best of 13.83 meters and a wind-aided mark of 14.02.With her fourth-place finish in the US championships last year, she earned a spot in The Match, a Ryder Cup-style competition between the USA and Europe.“We went to Belarus,” she said. “It was really fun. It got pretty competitive in the end because Europe started pulling away. I was able to end my season on a seasonal best.”Now she’s looking toward the Olympics and next year’s worlds.“(The Match) gave me that kick in the butt, like, this isn’t it. You have to get on your horse.”Just like her training clients.Grossman is the fourth-ranked climber in USA Climbing’s overall tally and has earned a spot on the national team.The bad news for this year is that USA Climbing only gets two berths per gender in the 2020 Olympics, and the women’s berths are taken.The good news is that she has plenty of time to get to the Games down the road. She’s a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado.She didn’t have to leave home to go to school. She and her family moved to Boulder, the city with the most appropriate name for a climber and a strong youth team in Team ABC, when she was young.“I moved to Colorado right before I started high school,” Grossman said. “There’s a lot of (climbing) gyms here. There’s one here every 10 minutes.”That’s a shorter commute than she faced growing up in Santa Cruz, California, where she sometimes had a two-hour trip. Getting back and forth between a gym and college quickly is important for someone balancing an elite climbing career with a couple of psychology courses, biology, ethics and philosophy.“I have class every day, so I normally get out around 2.30ish,” Grossman said. “Once I’m done, I’ll normally study for a little bit. Then I’ll go to the gym after that, normally around 4, and I’ll be there for around 3 hours. Then I go back to school to 7.”Her three-hour workouts include some sort of conditioning – abs, arms or legs, depending on the day – and she bikes around campus for extra cardio work. But the bulk of her training is climbing, climbing and more climbing. Her gym sets new climbs on its walls twice a week, and she can dial up thousands of different climbs through the Moonboard, a wall that lets climbers pick their own routes through the multitude of holds.“I go to the gym and have a plan,” she said. “That way I can stick with it and be efficient and not just play around and go, ‘Oh, it’s been two hours.’”Weekends are spent on even longer workouts or competitions, which usually force her to miss Friday classes. She only goes to overseas competitions in the summer.So in general, she has the time-management capability to train and study. What she doesn’t have is financial support beyond the occasional bit of free equipment or prize money – perhaps $1,500 for a first-place finish somewhere.“I have to pay for everything – my gym membership, flights to competition, hotels,” she said. “I’m trying to get a shoe sponsorship.”She’s unlikely to follow the Alex Honnold path and have a camera crew record something like Free Solo, the Oscar-winning documentary tracing Honnold’s daring ascent up El Capitan.“Competition is my main focus,” she said.Imagine juggling a job with a sport.Now imagine juggling a job with five sports.That’s the life of Sam Ruddock, an Olympic modern pentathlon hopeful who lives, works and trains in a city where you’d expect to find more actors than athletes.New York? Not Colorado Springs or one of the other hotbeds of Olympic sports training in the USA? Not someplace cheaper?“The way points are skewed, it’s become more and more skewed toward fencing and the run-and-shoot,” Ruddock said. “If you look at Olympic champions, the winners all won the fence. The best fencing in the country is in New York.”But Ruddock has to do more than fence. He has to swim, run, shoot and ride – a horse, not the subway.So Ruddock’s typical day may start around 6 or 7am in the pool at the New York Athletic Club. After he swims and stretches, he heads to work. After work, it’s time to run and lift weights. By 6pm or so, he’s fencing. That’s not every day, but he generally swims five to six times a week and fences three to five times.Riding is a bit tougher. New Yorkers can’t just hop on a horse and head to Central Park. Instead, he takes the occasional weekend at a friend’s house north of the city.The shooting aspect of the run-and-shoot is also a little tricky, but he can get a little bit of practice in the comfort of his own apartment, from one end of his bedroom to the fridge, or down a long hallway in a relative’s house. Fortunately, the shooting competition was revised several years ago so that athletes use electronic “guns” rather than bullets, so he’s not putting a few holes in the wall, Pulp Fiction-style.And about once a week, Ruddock heads to a track with his laser gun, a target and a bunch of duct tape, allowing him to mimic the pentathlon’s mix of running and shooting.When he’s not shooting, riding, swimming, running or fencing, Ruddock can be found putting his economics degree to work.“I work at a small consulting firm,” Ruddock said. “We’re an incubator, essentially. We help start-ups scale quickly. I work mostly on the fund-raising side. For me, it’s kind of like a dream job. The guy started the business about a year ago. He’s fairly flexible with my training. I can go in and out as I please, almost. It keeps me intellectually stimulated as well.”In case all that’s not enough, he recently started playing squash, which gives him a break from the more solitary pursuits of pentathlon.“It’s tough socially because all I do is work and train mostly,” Ruddock said. “Most social life revolves around bars and drinking and staying out late, and I can’t really do that.”Ruddock is a second-generation pentathlete who first competed in his teens. He’ll be 27 this summer, and this may be his last attempt to reach the Olympics.But after 2020, you may still find him in a pool in New York – or perhaps a squash court, tennis court or golf course.“To take a day without working out would be odd for me,” Ruddock said.In a Colorado gym last summer, some NFL players were put into a training group along with other athletes. Among them was a 33-year-old Colorado native who had just moved in with his girlfriend and worked at a start-up.This group of men who make a living in a sport filled with violent collisions were stunned to learn what their training partner does in the colder months.“They all think I’m crazy,” said Stephen Garbett, who competes in the head-first sledding sport of skeleton. “They’re all like, ‘What do you do?’”A decade ago, Garbett didn’t know much about the sport himself. But then came a life-altering experience. On a trip home from Beverly Hills, where he was managing a gym, he started to feel ill. He wound up in the hospital for more than three weeks, with appendicitis just part of the problem.“It showed me how precious life was,” Garbett said. “Since then, I’ve set high goals for myself.”One goal was straightforward – he would go to college aged 24 and become the first person in his family to earn a degree. The other goal had to do with what was on TV during his hospital stay – the 2010 Olympics. Skeleton was the sport that caught his attention.Off he went to the University of South Carolina, notably not near one of the USA’s two sliding tracks but home to some business programs that appealed to him. He got his degree in sports and entertainment management, then headed for the hills to take part in a combine for prospective sliders.“They’re normally looking for college athletes,” he said. “I was 27. I was the oldest age that they allow incoming athletes.”When it was done, he became one of the handful of Americans who compete in skeleton. His status as an international competitor gets him free ice time at Lake Placid or Utah Olympic Park, but it doesn’t give him a steady income. Nor does it pay for his summer training with NFL players and other athletes. Or his travel.Good thing he did the college part first.“That (education) has helped me understand gaining sponsorship,” Garbett said. “You have to understand how to negotiate.”His personal sponsors, USA Bobsled and Skeleton’s team sponsors, and a summer golf tournament help him generate the money he needs to stay on the ice. So does a novel job with a start-up called Hotel Carbon, which is opening hotels that cater to athletes – including esports stages and viewing areas, Garbett’s department within the company.His offseasons are important. Not only is he able to train, work and be with his girlfriend, but he’s also able to get outdoors and away from the ice for a few months. All of that keeps him from burning out while making a run at being one of the older members of the US team headed for Beijing in 2022, when he would be 36 years old.“In high-level sports, there’s a ton of pressure from the sport, and financially there’s a huge burden,” Garbett said. “When you don’t have an escape, you’re not able to perform as well as you could.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a34c87fc0bda30a390c5c556098ef7004438814/0_212_3650_2189/master/3650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2efab151ec5a28581309050b737e53ba","title":"south africa v england first odi live","story":"34th over: South Africa 194-1 (De Kock 105, Bavuma 80) De Kock completes his century in style with a four, which runs away through the covers with a fielder gamely running in his wake. And then again! The ball goes in a near-identical direction, and Curran (SM) gives vain chase once again. The players will take drinks, with the match surely all but settled.33rd over: South Africa 185-1 (De Kock 97, Bavuma 79) Woakes’ first delivery is dismissed through midwicket for four by De Kock, taking him to 5,001 career ODI runs, though an attempt to repeat the shot next ball goes straight to a fielder. Parkinson is called upon to make another ing stop on the boundary, and this time he actually stops the ball. The required run rate is down to 4.35 now.32nd over: South Africa 177-1 (De Kock 90, Bavuma 78) Parkinson’s back, and Bavuma heaves one high over midwicket for a one-bounce four. England were 140-6 at this stage, but South Africa are playing their own game by this point. This is now a 152-run partnership, and there’s more to come yet.31st over: South Africa 172-1 (De Kock 89, Bavuma 74) Curran (TK) bangs the ball into the pitch a bit, and De Kock takes a wild swing at the first but edges it away for a single. Parkinson helps South Africa along, ing over the ball on the boundary and letting one he should have fielded trickle into the rope.30th over: South Africa 164-1 (De Kock 82, Bavuma 73) Woakes slows the South Africa sprint: this over was dot-single-dot-single-dot-single, which wasn’t exactly what England needed but did at least make a nice, regular pattern on the scoresheet.29th over: South Africa 162-1 (De Kock 81, Bavuma 72) South Africa require only double-figure runs to win this now, and at well under five an over. De Kock slaps one square for four, and then smashes one straight back to Curran (TK), who can’t get his hand into position in time to catch it. Still, it’ll have to go down as a drop.28th over: South Africa 155-1 (De Kock 75, Bavuma 71) Woakes, England’s bestonly good bowler so far today, returns, but alas with no instant magic. He bowls one shortish across Bavuma, who pulls it off his waist and high over long leg for six!27th over: South Africa 147-1 (De Kock 75, Bavuma 65) Curran (TK) puts a lid on the boundary-smashing, with two singles and a two coming from his fifth over. Brief respite for England.26th over: South Africa 143-1 (De Kock 74, Bavuma 62) Blammo! Now Bavuma’s at it! Denly bowls a long-hop, not his first, and Bavuma smashes it away for six. So far Woakes’s economy rate is 2.60, less than half of England’s next least expensive bowler. 25th over: South Africa 133-1 (De Kock 73, Bavuma 53) Curran (TK) replaces Curran (SM), and De Kock produces the first maximum of the innings, hoisting the ball high into the air and straight down the ground. Then he tries to k one over cow corner and misses it completely, his first totally mistimed swing. Looks like he’s bored of ones and twos, which is both dispiriting and encouraging for England I suppose.24th over: South Africa 125-1 (De Kock 66, Bavuma 52) Four singles from Denly’s over, but they’re notable ones. This partnership has now taken 103 balls to add 100 runs, with Bavuma outscoring his captain 52-47. England’s best partnership was the 91 added by Denly and Woakes. 23rd over: South Africa 121-1 (De Kock 64, Bavuma 50) Bavuma reaches 50 with a single from his 53rd delivery, and De Kock smashes the next away for four. England require a complete momentum change at this point, but don’t appear to have anyone likely to engender one.22nd over: South Africa 114-1 (De Kock 59, Bavuma 48) South Africa are literally strolling at present. Denly has a bowl, and they walk a couple of singles before De Kock hoiks a fairly rubbish delivery over square leg for four. England were 108-5 at this point.21st over: South Africa 104-1 (De Kock 51, Bavuma 46) Curran (SM) is back, but he can’t instantly change the flow of this river. 20th over: South Africa 100-1 (De Kock 50, Bavuma 43) That’s half of a century for Quinton de Kock! He reaches it with a couple of singles, the first of which never went anywhere near his bat as it spun down the leg side, but the umpire was convinced.19th over: South Africa 96-1 (De Kock 48, Bavuma 41) Bavuma absolutely flays one past backward point for four. That’s a brutal, beautiful shot. Bavuma’s on 41 from 42 deliveries, and is looking right at home.18th over: South Africa 88-1 (De Kock 46, Bavuma 35) After a good over from Parkinson the players take drinks. England need a wicket or three at some point soonish.17th over: South Africa 86-1 (De Kock 45, Bavuma 34) Chris Jordan comes in. Bavuma’s sweet cover drive for four off the last takes South Africa to 86, now ahead of England’s run rate and with wickets in hand (England were 84-4 at this point).16th over: South Africa 76-1 (De Kock 43, Bavuma 26) A shot for the highlight reel from De Kock, a kind of falling reverse slap to deep point, where Denly cuts it off. This partnership has brought 51 runs, precisely as many as England’s opening pair managed.15th over: South Africa 69-1 (De Kock 40, Bavuma 22) De Kock and Bavuma both have a go at smashing the ball through the covers, but both shots are fielded and they bring only three runs between them. This is all a little bit too untroubled for England’s liking.14th over: South Africa 64-1 (De Kock 37, Bavuma 20) Matt Parkinson, making his ODI debut, has a first bowl. Good flight, good revs, but it’s all a bit slow, and the batsmen score eight pretty untroubled runs, concluding with a reverse sweep from De Kock that was fine in every sense of the word.13th over: South Africa 56-1 (De Kock 32, Bavuma 17) A wide from Curran (TK) brings the first extra of the innings. Bavuma smashes the next delivery with maximum force, but straight to the fielder at point.12th over: South Africa 52-1 (De Kock 30, Bavuma 16) Bavuma scoops one over his left shoulder for four. South Africa remain a little behind England’s run rate - the tourists were 61-2 at this point - but close enough to feel pretty comfortable, and with a bonus wicket in hand.11th over: South Africa 46-1 (De Kock 29, Bavuma 11) A new Curran has a bowl, Tom this time, and De Kock hits another splendid straight drive for four.10th over: South Africa 41-1 (De Kock 25, Bavuma 10) South Africa keep the scoreline ticking over with a full house of singles from Root’s second over.9th over: South Africa 35-1 (De Kock 22, Bavuma 7) Woakes keeps going. I don’t know what kind of filters Sky have on their cameras, but the sky above Cape Town today looks to be of the bluest, book-me-a-plane-ticket-right-now blue. I am finding the jealousy quite distracting.8th over: South Africa 30-1 (De Kock 20, Bavuma 4) Root comes on first change for England, and Bavuma gets off the mark with a reverse sweep down to third man for four. “They discussed a building-site?” muses Ian Copestake. “Surely it was of interest as a deeper reflection of their own shared desire to be useful and their regret at no longer being able to contribute something tangible and lasting within the environment. As retired cricketers commenting on the actions and achievements of others surely does not come without its own frisson of melancholy. So not just a building-site.”7th over: South Africa 25-1 (De Kock 19, Bavuma 0) Hendricks made six from the first six balls he faced, and then none from the next eight. Finally he’s undone by a cross-seamer from Woakes.Hendricks feathers a nick through to the keeper, who’s left with an easy catch!6th over: South Africa 24-0 (De Kock 18, Hendricks 6) De Kock edges Curran’s first ball but high and wide of Bairstow, and away for four.5th over: South Africa 19-0 (De Kock 13, Hendricks 6) Woakes lands one on, well, de kock of De Kock, whose box does the business. He gets a single off the last, again. On Sky, Mark Nicholas and Rob Key discuss at some length a nearby building site “I doubt it’s that interesting for our viewers, though, so let’s move on,” Nicholas concludes, not unreasonably.4th over: South Africa 16-0 (De Kock 11, Hendricks 5) De Kock mistimes a drive and the ball loops back towards the stumps at the other end. Curran es to his left, but doesn’t get anywhere near the catch. Hendricks drives the next ball, and there’s no issue with his timing, the ball scuttling through the covers for four.3rd over: South Africa 10-0 (De Kock 10, Hendricks 1) For the second over in a row, De Kock gets a single off the last ball. Hendricks has only faced three so far.2nd over: South Africa 8-0 (De Kock 7, Hendricks 1) Curran’s first delivery is pushed back down the ground by De Kock, a four from the moment it met his bat. Some singles follow.1st over: South Africa 1-0 (De Kock 1, Hendricks 0) Cards on the table, I’ve just got to OBO HQ from interviewing a footballer and watched nothing of the England innings. I bring nothing but enthusiasm and a vague ability to type. Hopefully that’ll be enough to pull us through. Anyway, action: the last ball of Woakes’ opener thuds against Hendricks’ pad and brings a loud appeal the umpire raises his finger but the batsman reviews, and the ball turned out to be heading down the leg side! Actually by quite a long way!Hello everyone! Right then, no messing about: the players are out, the sun is too, and there’s cricket to be played!That’s it from me. Simon Burnton is here to talk you through the runchase - you can contact him by email here or tweet @Simon__Burnton. Bye!It’s hard to know whether that’s a good score. The surface is sluggish and my instinct is that England are slight favourites, but the pitch could speed up when the lights come on this evening. What we can say is that Joe Denly (87 from 103 balls) and Tabraiz Shamsi (10-0-38-3) were several shades of excellent, and that England would like to dismiss Quinton de Kock as early as possible.50th over: England 258-8 (T Curran 53, Jordan 1) Curran ignores a short slower ball from Beuran Hendricks, assuming it will be called wide. Wrong! But England do get an overthrow from the last delivery after a stupid throw from Temba Bavuma. South Africa need 259 to win!Joe Denly’s outstanding innings comes to an end. He lifted a slower ball miles in the air towards long on, where Reeza Hendricks backpedalled to take a well judged catch. Denly made 87 from 103 balls, including 51 from his last 39 deliveries.49th over: England 253-7 (Denly 87, T Curran 11) An excellent over from Ngidi is tarnished when Denly smears the last delivery over mid-off for his second six. That takes England past 250.48th over: England 243-7 (Denly 79, T Curran 9) Hendricks misses a run-out chance off his own bowling, missing the stumps with Tom Curran halfway down the pitch. And then Denly is dropped by Smuts, a simple chance when Denly clothed a full toss straight to him. A terrific over from Hendricks nonetheless, only four from it.47th over: England 239-7 (Denly 77, T Curran 7) Yeeha! Denly charges Ngidi and launches a big six over wide long on. Of all the gin joints in all the world, surely he’s not going to finally make his first century for England here? I doubt there’s enough time. But he has played a gem of an innings, vaguely reminiscent of Michael Bevan at his best.46th over: England 231-7 (Denly 70, T Curran 6) This is turning into a handy score for England, who were 131 for six after 28 overs. If they get de Kock early, I think they’ll win. Meanwhile, the legspinner Shamsi ends with splendid figures of 10-0-38-3. 45th over: England 226-7 (Denly 68, T Curran 3) Tom Curran, who played some cracking cameos in the Big Bash League, gets off the mark by rifling Sipamla down the ground for two. A single to Denly off the last delivery takes him to his highest ODI score.The debutant Litho Sipamla gets his first ODI wicket when Woakes holes out to mid-off. His mother leads the celebrations, springing to her feet to hug those next to her in the crowd. Woakes, at his no-frills best, made a very useful 40 from 42 balls.44th over: England 221-6 (Denly 67, Woakes 40) Shamsi returns to bowl his last two overs. After three singles from the first five balls, Denly launches a superb drive to cow corner for four. That means he has equalled his career-best ODI score, which from memory was against Ireland at Belfast on his debut in August 2009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b44615c122e821e84ede767a88d2ed018cfd0c9/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3ecfea4c5018cebd8c2a0f8644155b","title":"the rise of facial recognition technology podcast","story":"Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the politan police in London.

The event was organised by Europe’s largest radio company, Global, which owns Capital and LBC, among others.“I was going to say big up Capital,” Stormzy announced, as he took to the stage to collect the award for best R\u0026ampB, hip-hop or grime artist. “But big up Magic as well. Magic are my Gs, you know what I mean.”The statement was a faux pas. The easy listening station Magic Radio is not a Global brand. In fact, it belongs to one of Global’s competitors, Bauer. “Stormzy shouts out Magic FM … at a rival radio company’s awards night,” ran a headline in .But Stormzy’s love of Magic is sincere and profound – and sometimes it cannot be contained. A year earlier, at the Mercury prize, an interviewer had introduced themselves as a reporter from Magic. “Magic Radio – are you mad?” responded a visibly amused Stormzy. “Before my career’s over, I need to have a song that Magic just play. ’Cos that’s when you know you have a legacy. If your song is just on the Magic playlist, and it sits there for the next 30 years, you have made something special.”Tune into Magic Radio and you will hear Rio by Duran Duran and Don’t Stop Me Now by Queen and Careless Whisper by George Michael. You will hear Moving on Up by M People and Don’t You Want Me by the Human League and Hello by Adele. And you will hear them over and over again. In the week beginning 20 January, the station played the 1997 Natalie Imbruglia track Torn no less than 10 times.In the popular imagination, particularly in London, where it began broadcasting under its current name in 1998, Magic Radio is still often referred to as Magic FM. “Magic FM is my life,” said James Corden in 2018. “I genuinely miss it when I’m away.”Since 2016, the Magic empire has expanded. The main station now broadcasts nationwide on digital radio (it is available on 105.4 FM in London), while five digital-only subsidiaries have appeared: Mellow Magic (lower tempo), Magic Soul (focused on soul and Motown), Magic Chilled (“fresh, laid-back hits,” aimed at a slightly younger audience), and the newest additions to the slate, Magic Workout (high-energy songs for the gym) and Magic at the Musicals (show tunes), both of which launched last year.Magic is hot property. Each week, 4.2 million listeners tune in to one of its stations, according to the latest available figures. That may not be as many as its immediate commercial rival, Smooth (5.75 million listeners and counting, across several regional and national stations), nor the most comparable BBC station, Radio 2 (14.18 million each week), but since Magic moved beyond its London origins, it has proved capable of rattling its bigger rivals. “The powers-that-be at Radio 2 are obsessed with Magic FM and the appeal it has to the middle-aged women,” reported the Radio Times in 2018. “Magic’s music policy doesn’t pretend to be particularly forward-looking. ‘More of the songs you love,’ is the station’s promise, and they deliver, from George Michael to Lionel Richie.”Looking back on the tectonic changes that have hit the music and media landscape in the past two decades, it seems a minor miracle that Magic, and music radio in general, still manages to pull in millions of listeners each week. Smartphones and streaming mean that anyone can instantly find just about any song ever recorded. And where, once upon a time, a favourite DJ might have been the person to introduce a listener to their new favourite song, nowadays streaming services such as Spotify can serve up endless personalised recommendations, based on your previous listening taste.All this makes it hard not to wonder why, when you can just listen to what you want to listen to, would you want to listen to a radio station that may play songs you don’t like, punctuated by adverts for Great Western Railway and Mr Kipling, traffic updates about the M25, and, in between the songs, chitchat of dubious interest? (“American houses have a lot of bathrooms. I don’t know why. Do they have weak bladders or something?” mused Nick Snaith, host of Magic’s mid-morning show.) What, in short, makes Magic magic?There is some data to suggest that in troubled times, consumers turn to music radio for comfort. “I saw some research on avoidance of news,” says David Lloyd, a former executive at Virgin and the BBC who now works as a radio consultant, “and one of the key things was: ‘I feel I can’t do anything about it’. And it’s that powerlessness that drives listeners to seek a bit of solace in formats like Magic.”Magic does carry news, but in its own way. In one week last autumn, when Brexit was dominating the wider headlines, the 8am news bulletin on the main station led on consecutive days with a plan to stop serious criminals being released from prison halfway through their sentences, Meghan Markle commencing legal action against the Mail on Sunday, Dina Asher-Smith’s silver medal at the World Athletic Championships in Doha, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s heptathlon gold at the same event. (Brexit news did follow later in the bulletins.) In general, Magic does not cover sport, but makes exceptions “when a sporting event captures the nation’s attention”, a spokesperson told me.Alongside the desire to escape the grim headlines, the expanding reach of Magic is testament to the power of musical nostalgia the extraordinary emotional hold that the songs we hear when we are young have on us when we are older. Everyone loves the music they grew up with, says Matt Deegan, the creative director at Folder Media, a radio consultancy. “Particularly 11 to 19. It’s the time you when discover yourself as a person, you go out for the first time, dancing, nightclubs.” When we switch on Magic, we are looking for memories. We are looking for sounds that trigger the feeling: “This was the song where I … ” Listeners, says Magic’s director of music, James Curran, are “coming for the warmth, the nostalgia of those songs that they love”.“If you drill right down, the ultimate drive to any radio station listening is mood,” says Lloyd. “Magic is very definitely a mood listen,” he adds. “It’s very consistent. You turn it on and there’s that sort of nectar you know, you’re not going to have a nasty shock. It’s always going to be a comforting, consistent sound.”One of Magic’s most dependable moods is Abba. “You know, there aren’t that many stations that would play Abba,” noted Curran. “If you think of all our main competitors, Heart doesn’t play them Capital doesn’t play them. Radio 1 doesn’t play them. Smooth will only play downtempo Abba. So they will play The Winner Takes it All, they might play Knowing Me, Knowing You or Fernando or Chiquitita. But no, they won’t play Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) or Dancing Queen, or Mamma Mia. So all those songs are covered by the Magic database.” On Magic, you can expect to hear Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia about four times a week.Even if you have heard a song a thousand times, there is something special about hearing it on the radio. “It’s a different experience when a song plays for you on the radio,” says the chart analyst and pop critic Chris Molanphy. “That combination of comfort and the occasional surprise, and you just sitting back and experiencing it passively, that’s still an experience that people want to have.” People have been predicting the death of radio since the 50s, but as Molanphy pointed out, “it continues to survive like a bacterium it’s still alive, even in the 2020s”.The origins of Magic Radio run back to July 1990, when Lord James Hanson – a corporate raider who acquired the nickname Lord Moneybags and was once engaged to Audrey Hepburn – launched a London station called Melody. It was inspired by easy listening stations Hanson had come across during his time in the US, where stations were based around a particular sound – something that took off in the US much earlier than it did in the UK. In 1998, Melody was sold to a magazine publishing company, which rebranded it as Magic 105.4. Ten years later, the station was acquired by the media conglomerate Bauer, which also publishes magazines such as Grazia, Empire and TV Choice.Today, Magic broadcasts from Bauer Radio’s headquarters in Soho. Bauer seemingly has a station for every age range. For 15- to 34-year-olds, there is Kiss. For “reluctant adults” between the ages of 25 and 54, there is Absolute. And for less reluctant adults, there is Magic. “The type of music we play, the type of presentation that we do, the topics that the breakfast show or another show might pick, the way we interview guests, all that sort of stuff, is trying to make this feel effortless, but also feel like a very warm and welcoming place,” Tony Moorey, the group content director for Magic and Absolute, told me. In the office, a screensaver on a desktop computer showed a whale surfacing in front of forests and snow-capped peaks. Mood-wise, very Magic.In the Magic studio early last year, I watched Tom Price, an actor and standup, present the weekend breakfast show. Price was accompanied by the producer Adam Herringshaw, who goes by the name Adam K professionally. Herringshaw, then 38, was wearing a backwards baseball cap and red high-top trainers. (Before Magic, he worked at Kiss, but moved, he explained jokingly, when the bosses felt Price needed ‘reining in’ he has since left the Bauer group altogether.)Just after 8am, Tina Turner’s 1984 track What’s Love Got to Do With It? was playing. The show had been on air for two hours. It had begun with Two Hearts by Phil Collins, passed through Hero by Enrique Iglesias, and Greatest Day by Take That. The newest songs were two 2011 tracks: Adele’s Someone Like You and Christina Perri’s Jar of Hearts.As Tina Turner played, Herringshaw spoke to a caller off-air to prime him for an interview. A theme for the show was “things you have accidentally broken”. The phone call remains a key tool for the Magic model of broadcasting. Phone-ins create a feedback loop, or at least the impression of a feedback loop, between presenter and audience, fostering a feeling of companionship. (“Your radio gives you something that your streaming list can’t,” Curran told me. “You’ve got a connection there.”)Price went live: “Loads of text messages coming in, for things that you have accidentally broken. Hello to Carol from Norfolk. ‘Hi Tom. Many years ago I was at my nan’s house. I went to use her bathroom. As I stood up to flush the chain, my wristwatch fell off into the pan.’”Later, off air, Price and Herringshaw gave their read on the appeal of Magic. Price argued that the station transcends its target listener base. “Every time I’ve told people I work on Magic, when I first started especially, no matter who I told – people our age, or people who are 20 – go: ‘I fucking love Magic,’” he said.Listeners love the Magic canon – from Queen’s Somebody to Love to I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) by Whitney Houston – but their sense of what should go into it is imperfect. On the School Disco feature, a part of Price’s show during which the audience can request records, someone often asks for Saturday Night by Whigfield.“There are other songs that we kind of make a view on,” Curran told me later. “It’s like – that is just a bit too cheesy for where we want to go.”There is an art to curating musical nostalgia: one wrong move and the mood is lost. Not long ago, Price played Chesney Hawkes’ earnest power pop classic The One and Only. But he said he had to “build up a head of steam,” before unleashing it, referencing the song over a period of time, hyping it up, before finally pressing play.Herringshaw agreed, just about: “Once a year, for like two minutes, maybe it’s not the worst thing.”In 2015, a brand consultant named Charlotte Melford, received a call asking whether she would help Magic better understand its audience. Rather than the kind of clinical environment in which a focus group is observed through a one-way mirror, Magic wanted something more organic. “They called me,” Melford remembered, “and said: ‘We need to go meet them, experience them, and actually get under the skin.’”Melford sensed that the executives at Magic thought listeners viewed the station as “a guilty secret – something they felt a little bit apologetic about listening to.” Beyond that, they didn’t seem to know much about their audience. At the time marketing research concentrated on millennials and older people. But, Melford said, the audience in between – the core demographic for Magic – was under-researched.Melford set up WhatsApp groups for listeners to discuss the station. She also went into listeners’ homes, hosting six dinner parties in London, Leeds and Birmingham. For Seb Clark, Magic’s marketing manager, the experience was surreal. “I was sitting in someone’s living room, watching them eat,” he said. “She was probing. But it wasn’t just all about radio it was their lifestyles.”One assumption of the research had been that people turn to Magic not because they care much about the music, but because they want to feel warm and cosy. But what Melford discovered was that listeners genuinely loved the songs Magic lined up, and weren’t afraid to say so. “We’d radically underestimated the sense of personal confidence,” Melford said.In September 2016, Melford delivered her findings in a document titled “Magic – Introducing the Luminaries – living life in full colour and rewriting the rule book”. It is aimed at potential advertisers, but it is strangely revealing. The “Luminaries”, as Melford branded the audience, are indeed “living life in full colour”. (This page in the report is yellow, blue, red and purple.) The study aims to convey that Magic’s listeners are vivacious and sociable, enjoy music and have money to spend. (The words of the listeners themselves occasionally suggest a slightly different reality. “We regularly head to bed at 9pm, open our laptop and watch a box set together,” says one 38-year-old woman.) There are, apparently, 9,979,000 Luminaries in the UK, of whom 5,728,000 are reached by Bauer radio stations.Melford is conscious that her research, conducted in 2015 and 2016, reflected a less fraught world: it was pre-Brexit, pre-Trump. But it had an impact on how the station sounds today. Until Melford’s study, Magic had focused more on the 60s, 70s and 80s now, in its relentless pursuit of listeners between the ages of 35 and 55, Magic’s playlist moved its focus to the 80s, followed by the 90s. (That decision matches up with research by the American data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, which suggests that “strongest adult musical preferences” set in at 13 for women and 14 for men.)On a Saturday night in February last year, queues of Luminaries snaked outside the Eventim Apollo in west London for Magic Soul, one of the live events the station organises. The hosts were Angie Greaves – an afternoon show presenter, who has since defected to arch-rivals Smooth – and Lemar, a singer who came to fame on the BBC talent show Fame Academy. The lineup included Gabrielle and Tommy Blaize, “the voice of Strictly Come Dancing”. Towards the end, Gwen Dickey, the lead singer of Rose Royce, who injured her spinal cord in 2010, was carried on stage and performed seated, flanked by energetic dancers.At the interval, the audience crowded around the bar. “It takes us back to a time when we were younger, when we had fun, we loved the music, we were out,” Suzanne Hirst, a woman in her 50s, told me as we queued for drinks. “It takes me back to a time where it made me happy.”The foundation of Magic’s success is its playlist, which runs to about 650 songs for the main station. That figure includes songs that only play on the evening ‘Mellow’ show – the daytime playlist is about 400 songs. Stations that concentrate on new music tend to have smaller playlists – Magic executives say Capital plays about 250 songs on extensive rotation, or possibly even fewer. Global, Capital’s owner, would not confirm that figure, sternly stating: “We never comment on editorial decisions.”Among contemporary music, Adele and Ed Sheeran are firmly established Magic favourites. Curran points to these artists as properties who could pass “the festival test” – if you’re a rock festival, could you put them on? It’s music that can work in any context. “No disrespect to One Direction – but could I put them on at a rock festival? No,” Curran said.On a Wednesday morning in September, I attended a monthly playlist meeting for Magic Chilled, which aims at a slightly younger audience than the other branches of Magic. Each month, Chilled will add about five new songs to its playlist. The first order of duty at the meeting was to assess the previous month’s new tracks: Lover by Taylor Swift, Beautiful People by Ed Sheeran (ft Khalid), two versions of the Freya Ridings song Castles (one acoustic, the other not), How Do You Sleep? by Sam Smith, and Señorita by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. The question was which of these would stay on the playlist and which would not, and what would replace them. In attendance were Curran and Brogan Hubber, a 25-year-old producer who also presents shows on Magic Soul.Magic presenters, with a few exceptions, do not get to pick their music. That is largely Curran’s domain and he has, in a way, been preparing for this role for most of his life. As a child in Edinburgh, Curran would listen to the Top 40 on Radio 1 on Sunday afternoons and write down the charts in order to discover their secrets. He would study how singles moved up or down, who was doing particularly well, or what genres were taking off. “I loved the statistical side of it,” he told me.Curran’s starting point for thinking about what music to schedule for Magic is the target audience – that, after all, is the demographic that the stations must deliver to potential advertisers. These days, Curran has a gut sense of what will appeal. Partly that stems from experience, but he also pays very careful attention to all the data he can get his hands on: official chart positions, midweek chart positions, airplay charts, iTunes downloads, numbers from Shazam (the app that identifies songs by listening to just a snippet), and the results of music library research, where listeners are asked to rate short clips of songs online. Above all, Curran and Brogan wanted to assess if the tracks were on their way up or down, and by extension, whether they should stay or go. In the end, the Sheeran and Ridings songs were axed, Smith survived, and Dermot Kennedy’s new track Outnumbered was added to the playlist.For Molanphy, the chart historian, this kind of curation remains essential to the success of music radio. “By and large, streaming is still a very active medium,” he told me. One of the attractions of music radio is that it is more passive. When someone else is picking the hits, you have “something comforting and familiar, yet with some element of surprise”, Molanphy said. “There’s a ‘lean-back’ aspect to radio that is hard to replicate with digital media, and I suspect that is the reason why terrestrial radio holds on.”The heart of Magic, and the show that is closest to the old, pre-Luminaries, lower-tempo days, remains Mellow Magic, presented by Lynn Parsons from 8pm to midnight every weeknight. One evening last year, I watched Parsons, a radio veteran who has worked across BBC and commercial stations, present the show. She is small and blond, and stands up behind her microphone as she speaks, a trick her first ever manager in radio insisted on. “As a presenter, you’re a bit of an actor,” Parsons said off air. Another of her broadcasting tricks – taking off her security pass to avoid on-air rattle – misfired one night not long after she had started on the show. She left the studio to go the lavatory and could not get back in.“So after 10 seconds of silence, an emergency tape kicks in, which starts with Beat It by Michael Jackson, which is not very mellow,” she said. “And I was running up and down those stairs. It went through Abba’s Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) and all these really fast songs. And I was just thinking: ‘What am I gonna do?’ I can’t get through any door without a pass.” Eventually, after 20 long minutes, Parsons was able to borrow a pass from a cleaner and get back into the studio.On Mellow Magic you are sure to encounter a lot of saxophone, a lot of crooning, and, in the words of one fan on Twitter, “banger after banger”. On the night I visited, Parsons played Anything for You by Gloria Estefan \u0026amp Miami Sound Machine Crazy for You by Madonna Because of You by Kelly Clarkson and Missing You by John Waite.If one of the qualities that the station offers is companionship, then Mellow Magic provides it in its purest form. “What are you up to right now? Are you working? Are you playing? Are you just drifting off under the duvet? Whatever brings your ears our way, you’re very welcome here,” Parsons tells listeners. In between the music, the show is a gentle stream of names and very low-drama anecdotes. “We have Mark the courier … Mark the courier, great to hear from you!” Many songs get a dedication. “A little bit of Abba for Emily Curtis. Have a peaceful night and a good weekend won’t you?” Solace is offered to listeners still at work. “Super cold out there. Really super.”Parsons told me about night owls who tune in: “It’s cabs, but also paramedics, the AA, Green Flag, all the people that are in their vehicles waiting for call outs.” A typical bit of Parsons patter, from a recent show: “It’s Friday evening. So good to have your company. If you’re working for the emergency services tonight, thank you so much for all you do. We really appreciate you being there.”Parsons asks listeners to email her their “whispers and windows”. The former are a mellow version of shoutouts (“Dave in Rayleigh in Essex. You wanted a whisper out for Joanne, who you’ll be marrying soon. She’s the most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen, and I love these songs. Dave in Rayleigh in Essex, thank you.”), the latter are photographs from listeners. Parsons posts them on her own channels, and Magic will occasionally retweet. Social media is a big part of the show. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are Magic’s “big three”, says Ian Bridgeman, who runs social media strategy for the station. Facebook is the most important, Twitter less and less so. “For our audience it’s still a bit impenetrable,” Bridgeman said. “It’s now quite an aggressive place to be it’s a very politically charged place to be.”Parsons constantly encourages listeners to get in touch. Occasionally, this has unintended consequences. Within a few weeks of Parsons starting at Magic, one obsessive listener began leaving threatening comments on Twitter and Facebook. The station contacted the police, who warned the stalker off. These days, following advice from her employers, Parsons responds to messages that seem a little bit too keen or intense with the sign-off “Strong Hug”. She explained: “They just wanted to make sure there was a real proper cut-off, after the stalker.” (Parsons made clear she had stalkers at other stations the phenomenon was not unique to Magic.)Still, for most listeners, Mellow Magic is a place of comfort and solace. Earlier this month, listeners tuning in at 8pm were greeted with a classic Parsons welcome. “I’m Lynn Parsons, here until midnight, with gorgeous laid-back songs. Whatever sort of day you’ve had, the evening is going to be so much better. That’s a promise.” Then she played Total Eclipse of the Heart by Bonnie Tyler, and for a little while at least, everything was so much better.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8243618c6586c20070e2acfdf53972709890dfbe/34_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3234382a203d2c3ad74f2120d22c76ab","title":"the good place was this the most devastating tv finale ever","story":"With so much to pack in, Mike Schur’s afterlife hit often felt like hard work for viewers. But its poignant ending proved this show could still be heavenly – and heartbreakingWarning: this article contains major spoilers for the final episode of The Good PlaceFittingly, Jason (Manny Jacinto) was the first to leave. He was, after all, the least complex of the four lost souls at the heart of The Good Place, so the ennui of eternity was bound to creep up on him relatively quickly. But it was still a shock when, after finally achieving his lifelong dream of playing the perfect game of Madden NFL, our boy decided it was time to check out. He did so after throwing a party at which he played particularly heinous EDM all night. “Great. Now I’m bummed about two things”, deadpanned Eleanor (Kristen Bell).The Good Place has always aimed high. Ambition was the greatest strength of the NetflixNBC hit – and occasionally its biggest flaw. Attempting to combine a convincing exploration of practical moral philosophy with sitcom wit and narrative drive was always likely to lead to the odd wheelspin. Much of season three felt like wading through treacle. Many viewers seduced by the early seasons of Mike Schur’s warm, inventive metaphysical comedy fell by the wayside. And yet the show’s saving grace was always knowing that an endpoint was in sight. It gave the stories weight and context, and made the journeys matter.This was the real wonder of the finale. Before our heroes arrived, the Good Place they were searching for was both perfect and wholly flawed, inhabited by bliss-zombies who were unable to do anything but stagger endlessly on forever. But former demon Michael (Ted Danson) and “Busty Alexa” Janet (D’Arcy Carden) had a solution. They devised a terminus through which sated inhabitants of heaven could pass into the great beyond at the moment of their choosing.This simple device was the key to one of the most poignant, perfectly constructed and occasionally heartbreaking hours of TV you’ll ever see. Jason’s departure was sad but also kind of okay. He was one of the least introspective characters in small-screen history and in love with Janet, an eternal being. But we all knew what was coming next. At the beginning of the series, Chidi (William Jackson Harper) had battled with hesitancy and Eleanor with selfishness. Somehow, Schur contrived a conclusion to their love story that was perfectly symmetrical, gut-wrenching and eventually, just utterly exquisite - a moment of pure clarity, as Chidi acted with absolute decisiveness and Eleanor tearfully understood the true meaning of the philosophy tomes she had absorbed. TM Scanlon’s What We Owe To Each Other is The Good Place’s key text. And this was Eleanor enacting its implications. After various extravagant attempts to make Chidi stay, she understood that she owed him the freedom to leave.This could easily have toppled over into gushy sentimentality. Yet somehow, it maintained a perfect balance. The fates of these characters mattered. But their journeys towards infinity were also undercut by the relentless comic beats of the show, and humour that was always sharp but never harsh. We met a super-evolved version of Janet’s virtual boyfriend Derek (“the nexus of Derek is without dimension”). We got a glimpse of Tahani’s (Jameela Jamil) magnificently eccentric celestial bucket list, which included everything from breaking longstanding cricketing records to “Fixing the Jesus Fresco that lady messed up”. And, after his apparent departure, we learned that Jason actually spent eons in the woods looking for a trinket he had made for Janet, and meditating. When Janet pointed out that he had effectively returned to his initial incarnation as a monk, he gazed at her uncomprehendingly – he had learned everything and nothing.It is rare that TV feels nourishing. But at the moment, surrounded by corruption, bad faith, antagonism and winter, it sometimes feels that we might be stuck in our own intractable Bad Place. But things change. The Good Place never forced a moral message but it carried one all the same. We can always do a little better. As Eleanor drained her last margarita and Michael began a new life as a (middle-aged) human, The Good Place felt definitively and satisfyingly complete. It ended with a tiny act of kindness, as Michael’s neighbour delivered a letter that had been left at the wrong address. Because The Good Place is wherever you find it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

But his ignominious departure from power at the end of 2002, after 24 years as president, when the candidate he groomed to succeed him was roundly defeated, told the real story of his years in power.It was a story of stability maintained by ruthless manipulation of the ethnic card and of his opponents’ weaknesses, and by the refinement of a culture of corruption and impunity inherited from his predecessor, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya’s first president.Moi, whose given name at birth was Toroitich, spent his early years in Kurieng’wo village, in Baringo, western Kenya, with his brother, tending the few sheep and goats left by his father, Kimoi arap Chebii, a herdsman, who died when Moi was four. His paternal uncle sent him to a protestant missionary primary school where he took the Christian name of Daniel. He went on to another missionary school for his secondary education, before joining the government school at Kapsabet, 100 miles from home. Every term he would walk to and from school.Moi became a successful teacher, and then assistant principal of a teacher training college, before moving into colonial politics. In October 1955 he became a member of the Legislative Council of Kenya (Legco) – one of five Africans nominated by the British colonial government.At independence in 1963 he became minister of home affairs, and three years later, also vice president to Kenyatta. Moi, as a member of the small Kalenjin ethnic group, was a convenient outsider – and one who owed everything to the president – for Kenyatta to rely on, as his own group of Kikuyu politicians feuded for dominance in his administration.Those were years of stability for the country, and Kenya prospered with investment and loans – the fruit of Kenyatta’s unwavering pro-western policies that included allowing British troops to be stationed in Kenya. The international community turned a blind eye to the flagrant corruption at the top of Kenyan politics and the political murders that removed the less pliant opposition figures.When Kenyatta died in August 1978, Moi as vice president became constitutionally president for an interim period of 90 days. All eyes were on the bitter fight for the succession between two competing groups of Kikuyu political heavyweights within the ruling political party, the Kenya African National Union (Kanu). Moi, seen as colourless, and lacking an ethnic base of any importance, was not considered as even a possible contender for the top job.Even when Moi was elected, as a unifier, his presidency was not expected to last, so dominant were the other competing candidates. But they self-destructed in power struggles with each other, and Moi, with his philosophy of “Nyayo” (peace, love and unity), was initially accepted by Kenyans. They believed he could give the country a chance of overcoming the tribalism that had so marked the corruption and influence-peddling of the previous administration.However, intolerance and exclusion soon became the hallmarks of Moi’s regime, and in June 1982 the constitution was amended to make Kanu the only legal political party. A coup attempt led by the air force followed in August, and was put down with extreme brutality. Intellectuals, lawyers and some military officers fled into exile.Moi weathered this challenge with more repression, and went on to consolidate his power base by allowing corruption to take on ever more extravagant dimensions. Highly personalised executive power became his recipe for governing, and imperceptibly he had become an unchallengeable leader, barely recognisable as the invisible non-contestant of earlier years.In the early 1990s persecution of ethnic groups associated with opposition or potential opposition led to hundreds of thousands of people being displaced in the Rift Valley, hundreds of deaths in so-called tribal clashes, and the detention of many political activists. Major scandals of misappropriation of government funds erupted, but were always hushed up. Such scandals – and ethnic cleansing – continued to the end of Moi’s regime. Ministers, politicians and senior civil servants also seized great tracts of public land, depriving thousands of poor agrarian people of their livelihoods.In mid 1995 the first major political challenge came, with the founding of a new party, Safina (Noah’s Ark). It was led by Richard Leakey, the white Kenyan conservationist with a distinguished record of work for the country, and some well-known lawyers and old politicians disgusted with the decline in the country’s prestige and the isolation of Kanu from the increasingly impoverished population. The new party encountered violent opposition engineered by Kanu.Reformist rallies for constitutional change held two years later were so violently attacked that 22 foreign embassies protested and the IMF threatened to hold back a $36m (£27.6m) loan – the first of what became major sanctions by donors and the international financial institutions. By 2002, the IMF had withheld $350m.Moi was too wily a politician to attempt to change the constitution to give himself another term in power, but in 2001 he began to prepare his departure and ensure his own future. He appointed to parliament Uhuru Kenyatta, the businessman son of the first president, quickly promoted him to minister for local government, and groomed him to lead Kanu. Moi, it was clear, would mentor the inexperienced young man.Not only did this enrage the old party barons of Kanu, who were awaiting their moment of supreme power, but Kenya’s opposition parties managed to unite after a decade of squabbling. Together they produced an upset victory that humiliated both Kenyatta and his promoter. Following the 2002 election, Moi was forced to hand over power to Mwai Kibaki, formerly a key member of Kanu but for 10 years an implacable critic of all the Moi regime had come to represent.However, by 2007, in the tough world of Kenyan politics, Kibaki found he needed Kenyatta – and made him deputy prime minister. Kenyatta was charged by the international criminal court with being one of those who perpetrated the deadly electoral violence that year. But this did not end his career and by 2013 politics in Kenya came full circle with the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as president.By 2015 the ICC charges were dropped and Kenyatta was re-elected in 2017. With the election of Moi’s youngest son, Gideon, as the powerful chairman of Kanu as well as senator for Baringo from 2013, Moi in his old age saw his political legacy consolidated just as he had long planned.In 1950 Moi married Lena Bommet, and they had five sons and three daughters. The couple orced in 1979 and Lena died in 2004 his eldest son, Jonathan, died last year. Moi is survived by his other children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef5491d3effbc02aa4d61d89820bb0a21769315f/0_9_1904_1142/master/1904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1ccd03edacdd9f6e77d2ce70bf57ad0","title":"ireland election sinn fein takes poll lead five days before vote","story":"Party leader says voters want change as poll puts it in top position for general electionSinn Féin has stepped up its attacks on Ireland’s political establishment as polls show the party poised for a historic breakthrough in Saturday’s general election.Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin’s leader, said on Tuesday that Irish people wanted a change from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, centrist rivals that have dominated Irish politics for a century.“People aren’t fools … There isn’t a whit of difference really between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael and people see that,” McDonald said before a television debate on Tuesday night with leaders of the three parties.The party’s IRA links alienated voters during the Troubles in Northern Ireland but it is now appealing to people in the republic who chafe at homelessness, high rents, hospital waiting lists and other problems.McDonald sought to fuel Sinn Féin’s momentum in Dublin – a key battleground - by assailing “ripoff” insurance companies and appearing alongside striking nurses on a picket line.RTE’s televised debate lineup originally featured just Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the Fianna Fáil leader, but opinion poll results prompted the broadcaster to add McDonald.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have ruled out sharing power with Sinn Féin, saying it still has links to IRA figures, would ruin the economy and would be soft on crime, accusations the republican party rejects.Fine Gael, fearing a wipeout after nine years in government, launched a counterattack on Tuesday. Simon Coveney, the foreign minister, accused Sinn Féin of fomenting “undercurrents of anger in society” and said its plan to increase public spending by €22bn (£19bn) in five years was reckless.“The word ‘change’ has been ambushed and abused. Voters are being promised levels of spending and policies that would cripple the Irish economy again. Populism in the short term with a disregard for future consequence.”Asked if Fine Gael would dump Varadkar if it haemorrhages seats, Coveney, a likely successor, said there was “no question mark” over Varadkar’s leadership.Fine Gael had hoped its record on Brexit and the economy, which has bounced back from a 2009 crash, would clinch a third term. But voters have instead focused on the cost of living and fraying public services.Fianna Fáil had hoped to ride the wave of desire for change but has struggled to distance itself from Fine Gael. The parties have similar policies and Fianna Fáil, citing Brexit threats, supported Varadkar’s minority administration in a confidence-and-supply deal.John Toomey, 40, a factory worker in Listowel, County Kerry, said he was considering voting Sinn Féin for the first time out of frustration with the traditional dominant parties. “There needs to be a change. The health system is totally bonkers.”Even Sinn Féin did not anticipate its surge. Chastened by losses in local and European elections last year it braced to lose some of its 23 seats in the 159-member Dáil assembly and fielded just 42 candidates, about half that of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.This means an election surge will not fully translate into seats despite Ireland’s system of proportional representation. Fianna Fáil remains the bookies’ favourite to be the largest party and to lead the next government.Northern Ireland has barely registered in the campaign but Sinn Féin has repeated its call for a unity referendum on both sides of the border by 2025.The prospect of a Sinn Féin breakthrough south of the border – just weeks after it returned to power-sharing at Stormont – has jolted Northern Ireland unionists, said Duncan Morrow, a politics lecturer at Ulster University. “Unionists are rapidly trying to work out out what this could mean.”In a surprise development Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister, attended a Police Service of Northern Ireland recruitment event despite the party’s fractious relationship with policing. “I think it’s seismic and historic,” said the chief constable, Simon Byrne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac8e39a0141876ffe799a976082becbfff9c6e5/1514_927_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e924c503cb68413c0b3337b8a0fa5c29","title":"wild and free five camping holidays in europe to help you reconnect with nature","story":"Get some winter cheer by planning your spring or summer camping getaway.

A chance to slow down, unwind and gently ease back on the throttle of daily life. So it makes no sense to bookend the experience with stressful airports and conscience-troubling flights. Thankfully, there are plenty of great campsites that are easily accessible by ferry, a far more relaxed way of travelling that can become an enjoyable part of your holiday …Mini Camping de Hooiberg, the NetherlandsThe Dutch are inveterate campers and so it’s no surprise that so many campsites in the Netherlands are run by people who really get the whole “life under canvas” vibe. Set on an idyllic organic dairy farm, Mini Camping de Hooiberg is one such site. It’s not just any old dairy farm, either, but an organic one that produces its own unpasteurised cheeses. They’re for sale in the farm shop along with locally made bread, and fruit and vegetables from nearby farms. Open all year, the tree-lined campsite, which has just 25 pitches, has its own cafe, and is situated in Brabantse Kempen, a region of forests, heathland and meadows criss-crossed with walking, cycling and mountain biking routes. And if your idea of camping heaven means not being woken at the crack of dawn by yelping children, then you’re in luck – this site is for grownups only.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Rotterdam. Mini Camping de Hooiberg is a one-and-a-half hour drive from there.Camping Scheibeekhoeve, BelgiumBelgium isn’t a country that one automatically associates with camping, but this makes Camping Scheibeekhoeve an even more joyful find. Set on a farm, with the Scheibeek waterway running around it, the campsite offers some welcome peace, tranquility and fresh country air. There are excellent facilities for those with disabilities, while children can burn off some energy in the play barn or on pedal-powered go-karts. The campsite is situated in rural Sint-Rijkersstraat, half a mile from the small village of Alveringem. It’s also less than 15 miles from the coast, making it well placed for those who fancy a swim in the sea, or a visit to Dunkirk and Ostend, both within easy reach. On the doorstep, there are some excellent cycling routes through Alveringem and the neighbouring municipalities of Veurne, Diksmuide and Lo-Reninge.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Zeebrugge. Camping Scheibeekhoeve is an hour’s drive from the port.Camping du Val-d’Oise, FranceSet among woodland where the deer roam free, Camping du Val-d’Oise has just 40 spacious camping pitches, so it’s never overcrowded. Bread is delivered straight from the ovens of a local bakery, and there are waymarked hiking trails through the Thiérarche countryside to the region’s rather magnificent fortified churches. Or you can follow in the paddle strokes of Robert Louis Stevenson by hiring a canoe and setting off down the often frisky waters of the Oise River.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, Camping du Val-d’Oise is two and a half hours’ drive away.Etangs du Moulin, FranceA little farther afield, in the Aisne countryside, the Etangs du Moulin campsite is truly one of a kind, and perfect for those with children who are resistant to conventional camping. A soupçon of the wild west come to Picardy, the site resembles an old frontier town and offers accommodation in wagons, tipis, log cabins and gypsy caravans (but if you’d rather take your own tent, there’s plenty of space for that too). Twenty-first century comforts include a heated outdoor swimming pool and a Texan-style pub and restaurant, while just beyond the grounds there’s the 9,000-hectatre (22,000-acre) Saint-Gobain forest to explore, which is perfect for both hikers and casual walkers.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, the campsite is less than three hours away by car.Maddybenny farm, Northern IrelandRun by the White family since the 1950s, Maddybenny farm makes an excellent rural base for a coastal adventure. The campsite, tucked behind trees beyond a 17th-century farmhouse, enjoys views down to Portrush, a seaside resort two miles away. There’s a playground for children and, if the weather doesn’t play ball, a games room too. Nearby attractions include the clifftop Mussenden Temple, with its vistas along Downhill Strand, while the pretty seaside town of Ballycastle comes complete with a sandy beach and a harbour. Boats leave there for Rathlin Island, a must for both nature lovers and fans of Robert the Bruce (he reputedly stumbled across his “try, try, try again” spider while in hiding there). The Roe Valley country park is a great place for rambling along the riverbank for a summer picnic or you can head to the ancient market town of Limavady, famous for the Londonderry Air, the tune to Danny Boy.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries has the shortest, fastest and most frequent crossing between Cairnryan and Larne, with up to seven sailings a day and a journey time of two hours. Maddybenny farm is just over an hour’s drive from the port.

Photograph: James FordeDún Laoghaire, a constituency which saw one of the big political dramas play out last year, with Fine Gael removing sitting TD Maria Bailey from its election ticket, is a race where several parties have an eye to gaining a seat.The affluent south Dublin constituency is seen as an area where both Fianna Fáil and the Green Party believe they need to win a seat if they are to have strong national performances on February 8th.Only two of the four incumbent TDs will be contesting the election, People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett and Minister of State for Higher Education Mary Mitchell O’Connor of Fine Gael.Bailey’s deselection by Fine Gael followed the controversy and negative publicity surrounding her decision to pursue, and later withdraw, a personal injuries claim over a fall from a swing in Dublin’s Dean Hotel.Bailey decided not to contest the election as an Independent and said she was ending her time as a public representative “with great sadness”.During the last general election campaign, the race in this constituency was effectively for three seats, given Fine Gael TD Seán Barrett was automatically returned after serving a term as ceann comhairle.This time around, Fine Gael will have no hope of returning three TDs as they did four years ago. Mitchell O’Connor will be the only incumbent on the party ticket, and will run alongside councillors Barry Ward and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill.Local issuesLocal issues expected to come up on the campaign trail will include housing and the cost of rent, transport and the BusConnects shake-up of the bus network, the cost of childcare, and climate change.Green Party councillor Ossian Smyth topped the poll with more than 3,000 first preferences in the Green wave of last year’s local elections. A former mayor of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, he is one of several candidates the party sees as a strong hope to gain a Dáil seat.Several other local wards in the constituency saw Green candidates elected after the first count, comfortably topping the polls.Fianna Fáil is running two candidates, councillor and former minister Mary Hanafin and Cllr Cormac Devlin. In the last general election, the pair polled enough combined first preferences to take a seat, but split the vote.The Labour Party has struggled to find a candidate to win back a seat previously long held by former leader Eamon Gilmore, with councillor Juliet O’Connell to stand for the party this time out.The local elections saw particularly poor results for Solidarity-People Before Profit candidates. First elected in 2011 and with a high-profile media presence, if Boyd Barrett failed to retain his seat it would prove a huge blow to the radical left-wing party.Boyd Barrett is the only candidate standing under the S-PBP banner, increasing his chances of holding the seat.Sinn Féin’s candidate Shane O’Brien was not initially seen by the party as a hopeful to take a seat.

The comparison is with the most recent Ipsos MRBI poll at the beginning of the election campaign in mid-January.Among the Independents and smaller parties, the breakdown shows a number of groups all within the margin of error of each other.Solidarity-People Before Profit is at 2 per cent (no change), the Social Democrats is at 2 per cent (no change), Independents4Change is at 1 per cent (no change), the Independent Alliance is at less than 1 per cent (no change), Aontú is at 1 per cent, non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (no change) and other groups and parties are on 3 per cent (no change).The survey was conducted face to face among 1,200 adults at 120 locations in every constituency. The accuracy level is estimated at plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Satisfaction slumpSatisfaction with the Government has slumped again, from 27 per cent at the beginning of the campaign to 21 per cent today. Approval for both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has also fallen, with Mr Martin’s rating falling by three points to 30 per cent and Mr Varadkar’s by five points to 30 per cent.Mr Martin remains narrowly the favourite choice to be the next taoiseach at 24 per cent, with Mr Varadkar at 23 per cent and Ms McDonald at 20 per cent.Mr Martin enjoys a more significant advantage, however, when it comes to the choice of taoiseach. A coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Labour is narrowly favoured as the most popular option for government, with 17 per cent of voters saying they would like to see it forming the next government.This is ahead of Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin (15 per cent), Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael (14 per cent), Fine Gael, Labour and the Greens (14 per cent) and a Fine Gael-Sinn Féin combination, favoured by just 7 per cent of voters.Taken together, these figures show that 46 per cent of voters favour a coalition involving Fianna Fáil – ahead of Fine Gael on 35 per cent and Sinn Féin on 22 per cent, among the options offered.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161652.1580836385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government advises irish in china to leave","story":"Timelapse footage captures a near deserted Beijing as authorities call on the 20 million residents of the Chinese capital to stay at home amid the coronavirus outbreak.

A number of Chinese airlines continue to operate, though not in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “We now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.“Where there are still British nationals in Hubei province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this.”The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk, the foreign office warned.Mr Raab told MPs in the Commons: “There’s an estimated 30,000 UK nationals in China and the proportion of the population who have the virus outside of Wuhan is much lower than in Wuhan itself.”A total of 94 UK nationals and family members were evacuated to Britain from Wuhan on two flights last weekend.Chinese authorities said on Tuesday the death toll in mainland China from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 425, with the number of cases now standing at 20,438. Two people have died outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday that although the virus was spreading rapidly in Hubei, the situation “currently” was not a pandemic.Macau, one of Asia’s big gambling destinations, announced a temporary closure of its casinos, while off the coast of Japan, 3,700 people on board a cruise liner are being screened after a passenger tested positive for the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.High Court judge: Jehovah’s Witnesses prioritised “spiritual counselling” of sexually abusive man over his young daughterPolitics latest news: Britain has a \u0026#39responsibility\u0026#39 to lead the charge on climate change, Boris Johnson says\u0026#39Forever chemical\u0026#39 found in half of all cosmetics could kill seals and dolphinsIowa Caucus 2020: Democratic Party ridiculed over delay in declaring winner - live updatesComment: Iowa is the strongest hint yet that the Democrats are heading for certain defeatTurkey warns Syrian army not to advance as it moves towards populated Idlib cityComment: Eldest, middle or youngest: you cannot escape your birth order destinyComment: Our outdated prisons have descended into mayhem.

Of course I want the platform, but I risk becoming a second Jamal,” Mr Masarir told the , referring to Jamal Khashoggi, the late Saudi journalist and dissident who was killed in his country’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Mr Masariri, 39, became famous for his YouTube channel “The Ghanem Show”, which he hosts from exile in the UK. The show, which criticised the Saudi royal family, earned him a legion of fans but also one powerful enemy - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.As the channel’s popularity increased - at one point his videos were receiving tens of millions of views - so did the harassment.The offer of a column came the same week as reports that Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and the world’s richest person, had seen his Twitter and other social media accounts allegedly hacked by the crown prince or MBS, himself.One of few not surprised by the news was Mr Masarir, whose own phone is suspected to have been infiltrated by Saudi hackers he is now suing. “What was interesting is that we seem to have all been hacked in the same period of time - mid-late 2018,” said Mr Masarir. “Me, Jeff Bezos, Jamal, Omar (Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist in Canada), and that’s just the people we know about. “Something was going on with Saudi at this time, a paranoia,” he told the  via end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal - the app of choice for the privacy-conscious as it is virtually impenetrable.He first suspected something was wrong when his iPhone’s iOS software was not updating, so he sent it off for analysis at Citizen Lab, the cybersecurity organisation at the University of Toronto.Experts assessed the phones of both Mr Masarir and Mr Abdulaziz and found spyware infections with identical elements — both were surreptitiously installed through a fake DHL package delivery link — and led to the same Saudi-controlled server.“Absolutely nobody in Saudi would do such a thing without the approval of MBS,” said Mr Masarir, suggesting he believed the hacks had been ordered at the very top.“I’m not Bezos, they didn’t blackmail me. I don’t have anything interesting enough,” he jokes. “What they want is to know everything about you: who you are contacting, what you are doing and saying. It gives them complete access to your private life in.”Mr Masarir, who has been living under police protection in north London since Mr Khashoggi’s assassination, last month filed a lawsuit against the Saudi government at the High Court in London, in an extremely rare case against the ultra-conservative kingdom.He wants an apology and unspecified damages. Saudi has three months to respond to his lawyers before they take the next step.There are few legal precedents and should the case reach court it will shine an uncomfortable spotlight on Riyadh’s alleged campaign of harassment of its critics. Not only that, it could broaden the scope of liability for cyber attacks.“He (MBS) has been running a campaign to silence critics and he has been successful,” Mr Masarir said. “For years it has seemed like the regime could not be touched by the legal system but finally I have the opportunity to hold them to account.Despite the reforms taking place under MBS, including women’s right to drive, the loosening of male ship restrictions and the opening up to tourism, he claims the kingdom has never been more repressive.“I speak to people inside Saudi and they tell me ‘we are like North Korea,’” he said. “The only difference is we have money and a good relationship with America and the West.”Mr Masarir, who has long been vocal of his government, arrived in the UK in 2003 to take up a place on the University of Portsmouth\u0027s computer science course. When his student visa ran out he applied for political asylum in 2012, though it would not be granted until 2018: a delay, he claims, that was down to Saudi pressure on the British government.He has taken a break from filming The Ghanem Show but still worries about his safety in the UK, pointing to his host country’s close relationship with the kingdom.The two are important trade partners. The British government even licensed the sale of £600 million worth of military equipment to Saudi six months after the murder of Mr Khashoggi. The hacking attempts on Mr Masarir have not stopped either. Just minutes before our interview he received prompts from Google to change his email passwords, suggesting someone was trying to access his accounts.He also continues to be targeted by an army of pro-Saudi government “bots” on Twitter, which send him hundreds of messages a day intended to intimidate him.But Mr Masarir is determined to not let them succeed, publishing his first op-ed in the Washington Post last week. “(At first) I kept my opposition to the Saudi regime quiet, but as time passed I felt the need to speak up for those who still suffered,” he told the Post’s readers.“It felt good to speak out,” he said of the column this week, “and I’ve missed writing, but I don’t know yet whether it can be a regular gig.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cvs shouldnt feature names grades schools universities says","story":"CV’s should not feature names, grades, schools or universities on them because they are a “barrier to opportunity”, a former cabinet minister has warned.Alan Milburn, chair of the Social Mobility Foundation (SMF) charity has teamed up with PwC, the global professional services company, to call on employers to overhaul their “outdated” recruitment processes which “lock people out” of careers.Together have today launched the Department for Opportunities (DO) with its campaign, ‘CV’s Aren’t Working’. The aim of the project is to encourage companies to remove peoples’ names, universities and grades from their applications, ensure that interview panelists hail from erse socioeconomic backgrounds, make sure that work experience placements and internships are subject to these formal processes and to review their internal culture for inclusivity.Mr Milburn, 62, a former Labour MP for Darlington who served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and subsequently as Secretary of State for Health until 2003, highlighted the campaign to key London-based employers earlier today.“How employers recruit is exacerbating the UK’s social mobility problem,” he said. “By overly focusing on a small number of selective universities and fee-paying schools they are locking out talent.  CVs are a big part of the problem.“By taking practical steps to revise how they recruit, employers can open their doors to a far wider pool of potential.    “They should trial removing names, universities, schools and grades to ensure they’re judging potential rather than simply past academic performance and social polish. That way employers can help themselves and help address the UK’s stagnant social mobility.”Meanwhile the SMF warns that as a result, young people from poorer and working class backgrounds are being locked out of professional careers because employers give too much weight to Russell Group universities and fee-paying and selective schools on CVs.The charity found that amongst government departments and agencies almost 8 in 10 of their hires come from Russell Group universities. It also found that over 8 in 10 hires at law firms are from Russell Group universities, even when in some cases only half of the applicants graduated from those institutions.Furthermore, 2012 statistics from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Race and have shown that applicants with Asian or African sounding names need to send twice as many job applications as those with a traditionally British name to get an interview.Laura Hinton, Chief People Officer at PwC, the founding corporate sponsor of the DO, said: We’re delighted to support the ‘CVs aren’t working’ campaign. “At PwC, we\u0027ve made significant changes to our student recruitment process to ensure we are accessible to a broad range of candidates and give everyone the best chance to impress. “We focus on future potential rather than past performance, and have refreshed the way we recruit to make it more appealing and user friendly and give candidates real insight into working at PwC. “We have also opened up new routes into the firm by increasing the number of apprentices we hire and introducing innovative new degree apprenticeships.    However a spokeswoman for PwC declined to clarify or elaborate exactly what had changed in their recruitment policy. Regarding its current student recruitment process, she said that it “focuses on future potential rather than past performance or background”. The spokeswoman added that the company also offers a “new targeted apprenticeship and school leaver programmes ensure we’re accessible to a broad range of candidates”. The DO, which will act as the campaigning arm of the SMF, aims to work with a coalition of civil society actors employers, schools, universities, charities and local councils, to mobilise support and promote practical solutions to tackle the problem of the UK’s social mobility. Almost one in three employers entering the Social Mobility Employer Index now remove the candidates’ names, grades and university from candidates’ applications.  Some employers are using innovative digital systems to test applicants’ potential rather than relying on grades.The Index launched in 2017 and since then 172 employers across 18 different sectors, collectively representing 1.5 million employees in the UK, have taken part.The aim of the Index is to encourage firms to share their initiatives and progress in becoming more inclusive employers and to reveal which sectors and companies are taking the issue of social mobility most seriously.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"iowa caucuses 2020 live results latest democratic news updates","story":"Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg claim victory in first Democrat vote Results to be announced on Tuesday, Iowa officials sayResults night descends into farce as officials delay results, citing inconsistencies Why are the Iowa caucuses so important in the 2020 election race?Iowa officials have announced that they will provide results from Monday night\u0027s caucus on Tuesday, after their vote to pick its Democratic presidential nominee descended into farce, prompting candidates to give speeches and leave the state without a victor declared. In a deeply embarrassing night for the local party, “inconsistencies” in reporting were blamed amid claims that a phone app used to report results did not work and rule changes caused confusion on the ground. Iowa officials on Tuesday said it was due to a coding problem.The Iowa Democratic Party, in an attempt to play down a blizzard of speculation about what lay behind the delay, issued a statement on Monday night saying that “this is not a hack or an intrusion”.  They also denied their app had crashed. But the complications meant that far from the national conversation being about which candidates had soared or struggled in the first state to vote for the Democratic nominee, instead confusion and frustration reigned.Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobucahr, the top five polling candidates leading into the Iowa caucus, all gave speeches claiming positives from the race before the result had dropped. Tens of thousands of Democrats are estimated to have participated in the famed caucuses, the premiere of more than 50 contests that will unfold over the next five months.From the moment Pete Buttigieg emerged to speak to supporters gathered on a basketball court at Drake University it was clear he knew he’d done well. He was smiling broadly despite the late hour.Mr Buttigieg pointedly waited until all the other candidates had spoken before doing so himself.There was anticipation in the crowd. One of his “precinct captains,” aware of internal results coming in, told The : “We absolutely crushed it.”But, with no results published, nobody thought the candidate would declare victory.When he called himself “victorious” and said “Iowa, you have shocked the nation!” the place went berserk. Hundreds of supporters in yellow and blue t-shirts chanted “Boot Edge Edge” and “President Pete”.After his speech an emotional Mr Buttigieg, 38, who would be America’s first gay president, embraced his husband Chasten.A new mobile app for recording the results of the caucuses - held in more than 1,600 schools, community centers and other locations - was deployed this year.The app recorded data accurately but only partial data, Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said on Tuesday. The app had a coding problem that was later fixed, he said in a statement.The party said earlier that the problem with the app was not the result of a hack or intrusion.Some local officials also reported having trouble using the app to report results.When some of those officials turned to the traditional method of reporting results - the phone - they said they were put on hold and could not get through for hours.We had people with their phones on speaker who were stuck on hold from 9 through at least 11, said Linn County Democratic Party Chairman Bret Nilles.This year, Iowa changed how its caucus results are reported to the public, expanding it from one set to three.On Jan. 16, the state Democratic Party announced it would release three sets of caucus results, in order to provide greater transparency - but making the reporting of results more complex. As well as the number of state delegate equivalents each candidate received, the party is publishing raw data.The queue is building up outside a pizza restaurant in Hampton, New Hampshire several hours before Mayor Peter is due to arrive.Among them early arrivals is former marine, Bear Davis.He has still to decide who he will support.“I am kicking the tyres,“ he tells the .Pete Buttigieg is to speak at several events in New Hampshire todayBut he has been impressed by Mayor Pete.“He is a very confident young man and he is kind of a centrist and not too far left. We are worried about electability, which is the key.“Biden and Warren are far left, which would make them a big target.“People who support Bernie are passionate. There is a danger that if they pick anyone other than Bernie people will stay home and we\u0027ll have the worst of all possible worlds.”Like you, we are disappointed with what happened last night in Iowa.But while we wait for the results, we cannot lose focus of the fact that New Hampshire’s primary, the first in the nation, is just seven days away.And we have to be ready, and Bernie cannot do that alone.Can you make a $2.70 contribution to our campaign today? There is no more important day to make your first donation to our campaign.We will be in touch as soon as we learn more.Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price said the delays were not the result of a breach and party systems were secure.While the app was recording data accurately, it was reporting out only partial data. We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. The application\u0027s reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately.The party said it expects to release unofficial results later on Tuesday, after manually verifying its data against paper backups.Unlike the November election and state primaries administered by state and local election officials, the Iowa caucus was administered by the Iowa Democratic Party. Nevada Democrats also have plans to use a mobile reporting app for their caucuses set for Feb 22.Snow in Iowa on January 29Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News on Tuesday that there was no indication of any malicious cyberactivity.He added that Iowa Democrats declined his department\u0027s offer to test the reporting app. That\u0027s not unusual, as outside security firms do similar testing. The state party had said previously they had worked closely with security experts to test the app.Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney said he heard that in precincts across his county, including his own, the mobile app was a mess.When precinct leaders called Democratic Party headquarters, they weren\u0027t answering the phones, Courtney said.From New Hampshire, our correspondent David Millward writes:Snatching a little sleep following the Iowa debacle , the Democratic candidates have been out in force criss-crossing New Hampshire today.Joe Biden has two events scheduled, Pete Buttigieg has five, Andrew Yang four,  and Amy Klobuchar three and Bernie Sanders two. They have been joined by Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard who has two engagements.It will also be voters’ first chance to catch sight of a late entrant into the race, former Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick who has three events.A tech company affiliated with, and funded by ACRONYM - a Democratic digital nonprofit group that has rapidly expanded in recent years - was responsible for building the Iowa caucus app that contributed to delays in reporting Monday night’s results in the first vote in the party’s presidential race, according to The Huffington Post.Multiple Democratic sources, including one of the presidential campaigns, confirmed the app’s creator. State campaign finance records indicate the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow, a tech company that joined with ACRONYM last year, more than $60,000 for “website development” over two installments in November and December of last year.A Democratic source with knowledge of the process said those payments were for the app that caucus site leaders were supposed to use to upload the results at their locales. After the results descended into farce on Monday, the Party said a \u0027coding issue\u0027 had been fixed and it plans to release results on Tuesday.The caucuses were already facing plenty of headwinds amid criticism that the overwhelmingly white state isn\u0027t representative of the country\u0027s ersity.But the Iowa Democratic Party\u0027s failure to release results left the contest, long criticised for its complicated rules, one step closer to losing its status.University of Iowa students hold up numbered cards while they caucus on Monday nightWith this reporting debacle, it may be the end, said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic presidential campaign operative and veteran of multiple Iowa campaigns.And that\u0027s from someone who loves the state and the process there.Jeremy Bird, a former Obama campaign adviser, said: It is on life-support at best.It has most likely taken its last breath as first-in-the-nation.Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, endorsed Joe Biden on Tuesday, calling the former vice president Democrats\u0027 best bet to win the White House.The Kennedy family has been a major force in Massachusetts politics for generations, and Caroline Kennedy\u0027s sought-after endorsement came the day that the 2020 Democratic contest landed in neighboring New Hampshire, which holds its presidential primary next week.Caroline Kennedy and Hillary Clinton in 2013We need a nominee who can compete in every state, who can bring wandering Democrats and independents back to the fold, and even attract some Republicans.Biden at the top of the ticket is our best bet to win the White House, keep the gains we made in the House, and put the Senate in play.High Court judge: Jehovah’s Witnesses prioritised “spiritual counselling” of sexually abusive man over his young daughterPolitics latest news: Britain has a \u0026#39responsibility\u0026#39 to lead the charge on climate change, Boris Johnson says\u0026#39Forever chemical\u0026#39 found in half of all cosmetics could kill seals and dolphinsComment: Iowa is the strongest hint yet that the Democrats are heading for certain defeatTurkey warns Syrian army not to advance as it moves towards populated Idlib cityComment: Eldest, middle or youngest: you cannot escape your birth order destinyComment: Our outdated prisons have descended into mayhem.

It did not serve that purpose this year.  The fact that we did not learn the result when the caucuses ended is an apt metaphor for this entire campaign. The Democratic electorate has not been able to settle on who they see as the best challenger to Donald Trump, and Iowa has not helped make this picture any clearer.It was nearly anyone’s game going into these caucuses.  Four different candidates – Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren – each held the lead in pre-caucus polls at various points over recent months. Amy Klobuchar was making a strong showing in recent polls.  At this point it’s not quite certain whether she hit her mark and turned this into a five-person race, but she seems to have played a key role in iding the centrist vote among multiple candidates.Caucuses tend to attract younger, more ideological activists than primaries do. These are groups with whom Sanders is strong and Biden is weak. Couple that dynamic with the lack of ethnic ersity in Iowa and you have a recipe for a strong Sanders showing in the initial preference counts.Sanders’s key groups tended to be in the minority among all caucus-goers, but provided him exceptionally high levels of support.  For example, according to the Edison Research entrance polls, about 1-in-4 caucus-goers were under the age of 30, but Sanders won nearly half of that group’s vote.Contrast this with the other end of the age spectrum – a slightly larger number of caucus-goers were seniors over age 65. Biden won this group, but with just one-third support while about one-fifth backed Buttigieg.National polls leading up to this race indicated that Democratic voters were willing to put electability ahead of issue alignment in making their choice.  This held true in Iowa, where 6-in-10 voters said that finding a nominee who can beat Trump was more important than selecting someone they agree with on the issues. Buttigieg (24pc) and Biden (23pc) are basically tied among the larger group of electability voters.But among the one-third of caucus-goers who prioritized issue alignment, Sanders took 36pc, which doubled the support any of his nearest rivals got from this group.Buttigieg was a strong performer because he appeared to be the top second choice among supporters of other candidates. Buttigieg’s popularity in Iowa had fallen off his peak poll position in December, but he had a very good organization in Iowa. He may have been helped by the fact that the US Senators in the race were taken off the campaign trail due to the impeachment trial.This is especially true for voters who may have has some affinity for Warren and Klobuchar. Buttigieg offered these voters a similar type of appeal as a fresh, yet pragmatic face who they got to see in the final few weeks. It also looks like Biden did not reach the viability threshold in many precincts and most of his supporters went to either Buttigieg or Klobuchar.Even though the Iowa results are inconclusive, Buttigieg may benefit from the veneer of being an acceptable compromise choice. But at this point we don’t know until we get a better picture of what actually happened in Iowa. If the field doesn’t narrow significantly by the end of the month, then the contest faces a new wildcard in the candidacy of Mike Bloomberg.  The former New York mayor made a conscious decision to stay out of the first contests in case a centrist frontrunner did emerge. Without that clarity, his presence in the Super Tuesday contests in early March is likely to muddy the waters even more.Patrick Murray is director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey, USAThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask.

I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement.

OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate.

The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film. This later prompted the film\u0027s chief designer, Amy Wetcott, to respond publicly by saying the designers\u0027 involvement with the tutus had been exaggerated. Regardless, the film\u0027s tutus – and this one in particular – remain a significant part of the film\u0027s visuals. OPBaz Luhrmann\u0027s The Great Gatsby is a visual feast for many reasons but for fashion fans in particular, it is the film’s costumes that really capture the hedonistic era of the 1920s.SYWhy limit your red carpet look to just one dress when you can have four? That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event. OPWhen Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in early December 2018, the pair paid tribute to the heritages of their families by having both Christian and Hindu ceremonies to mark the occasion.SYJared Leto, holding a model of his own head while clad in blood red robes on the 2020 Met Gala pink carpet, was quite a striking image. The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time. OPGetty Images for The Met Museum1550 36 - Sansa Stark\u0027s armour dress, Game of Thrones, 2019For the final episode of Game of Thrones, the character of Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, wore a dress that symbolised the journey she had been on to become Queen of the North.SYRihanna\u0027s outfit at the 2018 Met Gala where the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion \u0026amp The Catholic Imagination, is not one anybody is likely to forget any time soon. Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection.

As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus. When Jodie Comer stomped across our screens in Killing Eve wearing Balenciaga biker boots and Molly Goddard’s frothy pink dress, it turned the British designer into a household name. OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black.

That was the thinking behind Lady Gaga\u0027s look at the 2020 Met Gala, where the singer first stepped out in a fuchsia caped gown that had a 25-foot train. Accompanied by designer Brandon Maxwell, Gaga then began to unzip the colossal dress to reveal a corseted black number beneath complete with opera gloves. After applying some lipstick in front of the cameras, the 33-year-old then unzipped again to reveal a third look: a bright pink column dress. Finally, it was time for Gaga to offer one final ensemble: a black crystal bra with matching knickers and fishnet tights. Paired with her doll-like make-up and platinum hair, Gaga\u0027s four looks perfectly captured the playful spirit of the camp-themed event. OPWhen Priyanka Chopra married Nick Jonas in early December 2018, the pair paid tribute to the heritages of their families by having both Christian and Hindu ceremonies to mark the occasion.SYJared Leto, holding a model of his own head while clad in blood red robes on the 2020 Met Gala pink carpet, was quite a striking image. The gown was designed by Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele who showed similar looks at his autumnwinter 2018 show, sending each of the models down the runway with a fake severed head. According to Michele, each head took roughly six months to make. We are the Doctor Frankenstein of our lives, Michele told British Vogue at the time. OPGetty Images for The Met Museum1550 36 - Sansa Stark\u0027s armour dress, Game of Thrones, 2019For the final episode of Game of Thrones, the character of Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, wore a dress that symbolised the journey she had been on to become Queen of the North.SYRihanna\u0027s outfit at the 2018 Met Gala where the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion \u0026amp The Catholic Imagination, is not one anybody is likely to forget any time soon. Given that RiRi had modeled her look on the Pope, the highest member of the Catholic church, some people accused her of religious appropriation and said the look was disrespectful and sexualised Catholicism. OP1750 34 - Jemima Kirke and Lena Dunham\u0027s Met Gala dresses, Christopher Kane, 2019The famous friends put the sisterhood front and centre with their co-coordinating Met Gala looks designed by Christopher Kane. Both were apt ensembles for the event\u0027s camp theme, though they were apparently rather difficult to get into, with both women reportedly having to use lubricant in order to put on the latex dresses. While the dresses were created especially for the actors, the looks reflected the playful eroticism in his autumnlwinter 2019 collection.

Zeigfeld Girl.SYIn recent years, actor Lupita Nyong\u0027o has become one to watch on the red carpet, delivering several impressive looks throughout awards season.SYLily Rose Depp, the daughter of of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, enjoyed her second stint as a Chanel runway model in 2017, closing the fashion house’s Spring Haute Couture show. As is customary with any Chanel couture show, the final look was a bridal gown. For the showstopping moment, the 17-year-old was dressed in a ruffled blush pink gown featuring a voluminous skirt and sleeves with a corseted bodice, a Peter Pan collar and a large belt. SYSimple, playful and vintage Keira Knightley\u0027s wedding dress was famed for its understated elegance. Yes, it was Chanel couture (springsummer 2006), but unlike most celebrity wedding gowns, this one was unfussy, featuring a simple pale grey hue, a ruched strapless bodice, and a hemline that skimmed the knees as opposed to the traditional sweeping train. The gown matched the occasion, with Knightley and husband James Righton reportedly tying the knot in front of a small group of close friends and family in the south of France. Proving herself to be a supporter of sustainable fashion, Knightley even re-wore the dress (as seen here) to an charity event in London just a few months later. OP With a wardrobe consisting of printed playsuits and bleached denim, Eleven from hit sci-fi show Stranger Things became somewhat of a fashion icon as soon as the first series hit our TV screens. Stranger Things images shot up 40 times in the months following the launch of the first season, and while Eleven\u0027s pink frock has proved popular, global search platform Lyst has also witnessed a surge in searches for trucker caps and Eighties printed T-shirts inspired by characters Dustin and Chief Hopper, showing the all-round fashion clout of the show. SYActor Elle Fanning made waves with her style throughout the Cannes Film Festival but it was this 1940s-inspired look she wore to the Once Upon a Time In… Hollywood premiere that made headlines.SYWho could forget that fateful moment when Jennifer Lawrence – then at the early stages of her career – tripped and fell because of the cut of her dress as she went to collect her Academy Award for best actress for her role in Silver Linings Playbook ? Lawrence took it in her stride and got herself up before making light of the moment in her speech. The dress she wore has become instantly recognisable thanks to this moment. Strapless, fitted and with a voluminous skirt, the Dior gown suited the occasion perfectly and made Lawrence\u0027s fall one of the most graceful in history. OP2550 26 - Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala dresses, Versace, 2019Kendall and Kylie Jenner made the grandest of entrances to the 2019 Met Gala, coordinating in bright feathered dresses. Kendall opted for a show girl-inspired bright orange feathered dress, while Kylie chose a lavender feathered gown and matching wig. Social media users instantly made plenty of comparisons to the Jenners\u0027 looks including Scooby Doo\u0027s Velma and Daphne, the sisters from Ella Enchanted, and the twins from White Chicks. On the carpet, Kendall said she and Kylie really “went for it” and designed their outfits with Donatella Versace. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumWhen Pippa Middleton walked towards Westminster Abbey behind her sister on the 29 April 2011, few could have predicted the impact her gown would have on the world. Kate might have been the one getting married that day, but Pippa\u0027s name was in almost as many headlines thanks to the way that cowl neck ivory gown hugged her figure. Unfortunately, while many praised Sarah Burton\u0027s flawless design which had 58 buttons down the back, the moment led to an unsavoury amount of sexist commentary, with many people focusing on Middleton\u0027s body over everything else and lauding her as a sex symbol. But Pippa was able to make light of the scenario when, a few years after the wedding, she teased in an interview with the Daily Mirror that the dress fit “a little too well”. OPWhile Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u0027s red carpet choices are always commendable (she favours cult womenswear label Galvan and their signature jumpsuits), this one is her most famous thanks to a viral photograph of the Fleabag creator sat in a throne-like chair at an Emmys after party, cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other and surrounded by her four statuettes. The photo was hailed as epitomising old school Hollywood glamour and feminist empowerment, earning Waller-Bridge\u0027s sequin covered gown much praise and adulation online.

The humble “printed dress”, as it’s called on the retailer’s website, costs just £39.99 and has been spotted on dance floors, in festivals and at several wedding receptions. Some women even got married in the dress. The retailer has since made it available in other colour ranges, including olive green, black and deep red.OPThe hit heist film American Hustle was set in New Jersey in 1978. While the male cast revived some serious crimes against fashion, from boxy suits to micro perms, the movie’s female stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams lucked out.SYIf anyone is going make a sartorial statement on their wedding day, you could always count on Kate Moss. For her nuptials to Jamie Hince in 2014, the British model wore a custom John Galliano gown with sheer detailing and a floral sequin skirt. According to Galliano, the dress was inspired by Zelda Fitzgerald, the troubled wife of The Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald. While the marriage might not have lasted – Moss and Hince split in 2016 – the impact of the model\u0027s stellar gown will certainly stand the test of time. OPWith the theme of “Camp”, this year’s Met Gala was always going to be one of the best for red carpet ensembles.American Vogue: “He envisioned me this California girl stepping out of the ocean, wet, dripping”. The reality star later revealed that the corset she wore under the dress was so tight she had to take corset-breathing lessons and struggled to sit down the entire night. SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumIn 2016 supermodel Bella Hadid attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing an Alexandre Vauthier gown that featured a slit that went above the thigh. The look prompted hundreds of headlines around the world and instantly became one of Hadid’s most memorable in addition to firmly heralding her arrival into the fashion industry. OPFor Bill Condon’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast, the director enlisted the help of Academy Award-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran to create Belle\u0027s (Emma Watson) famous yellow gown. The dress itself featured multiple layers of yolk yellow-dyed organza and 2,160 Swarovski crystals and it took a team of seamstresses more than 12,000 hours to make. The significance of Watson’s gown was bolstered by the fact that it lit up our screens a mere two months after Emma Stone’s similarly sunshine yellow gown did the same in La La Land. Yellow went on to reign as the colour of the season that year and was soon dubbed the next millennial pink, earning the nickname “Gen Z yellow”. OPOPIf Instagram had a fling with a tutu, their child would look something like Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s slogan dresses. With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus. When Jodie Comer stomped across our screens in Killing Eve wearing Balenciaga biker boots and Molly Goddard’s frothy pink dress, it turned the British designer into a household name. OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.  SY4950 2 - The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding dress, Alexander McQueen, 2011Kate Middleton and Prince William\u0027s wedding on 29 April 2011 included many memorable moments but no detail has stood the test of time quite like the duchess’s iconic wedding dress. SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black. SYAll things considered, then, I presumed this pledge would be easy. I’d finally kick my \u0026amp Other Stories habit, something that might harm\u0026nbspthe planet as much as it harms my wallet, and enjoy the feeling of knowing I’ll be making better, more sustainable sartorial choices. But having given this some thought, I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about waving goodbye to the ease and accessibility that high street shopping allows. What if I ladder my tights at work? Or forget to pack a second pair of underwear for after my lunchtime gym session? Such issues arise – all too often for me – and it’s arguably easiest to solve them by heading to the nearest high street shop, which, let’s face it, is probably not going to sell eco-friendly lingerie.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn.

I’m like: ‘This doesn’t sound right’,” he told the Financial Times.Why is everyone so worried about Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency?Visa also cited concerns about financial inclusion when it pulled out, with the company saying it would instead focus its efforts on the the mobile payments platform M-Pesa.The questions are part of the much broader scrutiny that has surrounded Libra since it was first unveiled in 2019.Some politicians in the US and Europe have called for its development to be halted, with French finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u0026nbspsaying in September that he would block the development of Libra on European soil as it poses a threat to monetary sovereignty.More recently, Swiss finance minister Ueli Maurer\u0026nbspsaid it would not be accepted by central banks and had therefore failed in its current form.Libra\u0027s failure to commit to not do anything that is not fully compliant with local law was one of the reasons Mr Banga\u0026nbspcited for Mastercard\u0027s withdrawal.Libra did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously said the digital currency\u0027s development would continue regardless of partners pulling out.Dante Disparte, head of policy at the Libra Association, said in a recent statement: Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra\u0027s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That plan was pulled with just two weeks to go, the paper reported.Very quickly, users started reporting glitches and errors, and organisers were able to input the information as intended. Many complained that they were being shown error messages and that the app would not load properly, forcing them to call in rather than use the app as planned.The Iowa caucus fiasco is a metaphor for the state of US democracyJonathan Green, who chaired a precinct in Lone Tree, said that when he tried to put the results into the reporting app, he kept getting a confusing error message: Unknown protocol. The address specifies a protocol (e.g., wxyz:??.) the browser does not\u0026nbsprecognise, so the browser cannot properly connect to the site.The backup plan of having people call in their results also ran into trouble because the phones they had been asked to use in case of problems were not being answered, according to Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney.Issues were further exacerbated by the fact that the app was only made available at a later stage, in an attempt to stop outside interference. That meant it had not been fully tested, and that organisers had little experience of it before the caucuses.Officials have stressed that the delays and problems are not the result of a hack or intrusion, and that the results will remain safe despite the problems.We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, the party said in a statement. This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.The creation of the app still remains mired in some mystery: very little is known about the process of its creation, or where it came from. Though it is reported to have been made by a company called Shadow, the exact details of that startup are still unclear.In fact, many of the organisations – such as nonprofit Acronym, which was reported to be an investor – have actually distanced themselves from the creation of the app in the wake of the mess.All of the information is also kept in paper backups, and officials can now scour through those to find less high-tech but more reliable results for who has won. Local Democratic officials have claimed that means that the result will still arrive as normal, and will be reliable when it does, with the problems only meaning that they will take longer to actually report.But the fallout could have broader implications beyond Iowa – into the rest of the primaries and caucuses, and even into further elections. As well as further scrutiny of the app, it could lead to yet more questions about why Iowa gets to be the first state in the country to declare, and whether that privilege should go to somewhere else in the wake of such high-profile mistakes.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can\u0027t do anything\u0027Awais\u0026nbspRaza\u0026nbspisn’t sure how old he is. He barely remembers anything from his early years, or perhaps he blocks it out. What the Afghan national does know is that his father, mother and sister were killed when he was very young, and he was subsequently taken to a children’s home – but what he describes sounds more like a prison.“They would tell me to work: ‘Clean the house, take this rubbish, take this bag here,’” says\u0026nbspAwais, wincing at the memory. “They told me to go outside and take this bag, small and big bags, and would tell me to take it somewhere. If I didn’t do it they would beat me, or burn my feet. They were treating me like this for a long time, doing these things to me.” He parts his hair to reveal a long scar embedded into his scalp, before pushing down his socks to reveal burns on his ankles and feet.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 15 years on,\u0026nbspthe Afghan national sits on a bench in east London. He arrived in the UK nearly a decade ago after an “uncle” – the term he uses for older men of his nationality – helped him escape the violence, labour exploitation and sexual abuse he was subjected to for most of his childhood. He has since been saved from his exploiters, but faced a different challenge – the battle\u0026nbspfor protection from the Home Office.When Awais\u0026nbsparrived in Britain he was housed by an Afghan man in Luton.\u0026nbspHe was at some point given a passport which indicated that his date of birth was 1 June 1994 – making him 24.\u0026nbspHe stayed with the man for just under a year until the man left the country, then he went between various friends he had met in the UK. After two years helping with cooking and cleaning in people’s houses, he came to realise that, in order to access education and employment, he had to apply for asylum.Torture victim unlawfully detained by Home Office speaks outHome Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdogAsylum seeker detained for half a decade released to homelessnessAwais, at this point aged 20, was invited to a Home Office interview, where he was asked to recount experiences he had learned to bury. After several hours, he was shocked to discover that he was being detained.He was held in the detention for 13 days, during which a doctor prescribed him medication to relieve flashbacks to the abuse he had suffered as a child. It has since transpired that Awais’s detention was unlawful – forcing the Home Office to pay him £10,000 in compensation.“I struggled to sleep in the night time,” he remembers. “It was like being in the house again. Sometimes I would sleep for five or six hours in the morning, but at night it was a big problem. I\u0026nbspwanted to forget the past – but I couldn’t.”Awais\u0026nbspwas released from\u0026nbspHarmondsworth\u0026nbspfollowing intervention from his solicitor. A medical report was carried out into his physical and mental health which found that he was suffering from\u0026nbspPTSD\u0026nbspand depression, which would both “worsen significantly” were he to be threatened with return to his country of origin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt also found that during his childhood he had been a victim of\u0026nbspbeatings,\u0026nbsplabour exploitation and child sexual abuse.Home Office to pay £25,000 in damages for unlawful deportation attemptOn the basis of the medical report, his solicitor had referred him to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), the Home Office’s official framework for identifying victims of modern slavery. The system aims to decide on cases within 49 days – but in Awais’s case took a year to confirm that he was a victim. During this time he was\u0026nbspmoved into asylum accommodation in Newcastle, where he was able to study English at college for two years. When this period ended though, he was left in a rut for two years, unable to work and left to wallow in the fear that his asylum claim would be refused.“It was good when I was going to\u0026nbspcollege because I was busy. But after two years they said I had to stop, and then I just stayed all day at home,” Awais says, quietly. “You don’t know where your life is. You spend all day at home. You wake up in the morning, same day, same thing. I couldn’t do anything.”The year after a decision was made on his modern slavery case, he was invited to another asylum interview at the Home Office. “They asked me what would happen if I was sent back to Pakistan or Afghanistan,” he remembers. “I said I don’t know, maybe they’d kill me maybe I would kill myself. I said … maybe if I go there they will make me work and beat me. They wrote it down.”Yet Awais was refused asylum in May 2019, with the Home Office saying that it had been decided he should instead be granted temporary leave to remain for 30 months. His solicitor intervened, and in August of that year an immigration judge overturned the decision, stating that it was unlawful to reject his asylum claim.When asked about Awais’s immigration case, the\u0026nbspHome Office\u0026nbspsaid it did not routinely comment on inidual cases, but said that being referred to the NRM did not automatically result in asylum being granted or refused if an asylum claim has been made.Gabor Nagy of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who represented Awais, says the Home Office claimed to\u0026nbsptreat victims of trafficking as a priority in relation to their asylum claims, but that he was seeing a growing number of cases – such as that of Awais – where, despite identifying people have suffered abuse, the department continue to question and delay their right to be granted protection and support in the UK.“The whole process from start to finish took the Home Office an unacceptable five years while my client was left in limbo with his severe PTSD. The waiting around has affected him so much that he still required counselling and psychological intervention long after he had been granted refugee status in the UK,” he adds.Mr Nagy also accused the Home Office of “disregarding” the medical report and for granting Awais “tenuous” discretionary leave when in fact the immigration judge had found him to be a refugee.With his newly granted refugee status, Awais\u0026nbsphopes to finally move on from the past and establish a happier life for himself.“It’s taken five years – in 2014\u0026nbspI claimed asylum, in 2019 I got my status. It was a long wait. You don’t know where your life is,”\u0026nbspsays the 24-year-old, looking down at the floor. Then he looks up again:\u0026nbsp”But now it\u0026nbspis better than before. Every day brings something new. I want to start working. I want to\u0026nbsponly look towards my\u0026nbspfuture, not my past. I’m hopeful for the future.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not sure European leaders, let alone leaders here in the UK would actually welcome that kind of language.”Renewed calls for Scottish independence follow UK’s departure from EUIn response to accusations there was no plan for Scotland, Mr Raab added: “I don’t think that’s right, we want to make sure, with the levelling-up agenda, with the opportunities of Brexit right across the board, that Scotland’s got the great opportunity to take advantage of all those benefits.“At the same time, we obviously expect the SNP to deliver on its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum and not keep coming back and asking for a second one.“But a lot of this is a distraction from the standards in schools, the high level of taxes, that actually the job of the Scottish government in discharging its responsibility to the Scottish people ought to be focused on.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Expect independence to surgeThousands march to demand Scottish independenceOn Friday, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, who has been demanding Boris Johnson grant the Scottish government the powers to hold a second independence referendum, said Brexit was a “profound moment of sadness” for many who did not vote to Leave in Scotland.The comments from Mr Tusk come after a YouGov poll which showed 51 per cent support for independence – a majority for the first time in five years.However, a majority of Scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in 2020 or 2021, but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years.Also speaking on the issue, Labour’s shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, told the BBC: “I desperately don’t want them to, I want a United Kingdom. I will always argue for that UK and I’m hoping they don’t go along that path.“But I just say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues, do not do things that will threaten the unity of our country – and the language that we’ve heard even in the last 24 hours is isive, rather than holding the country together.“And if he can’t secure a good deal, it will again encourage others therefore in Scotland to go their own way and I think it would be completely counterproductive for the Scottish people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Putting political considerations over people\u0027s health and safety, this, basically, is extremely vile.A passenger plane has been forced to land in Canada after a\u0026nbspman falsely announcing to passengers he had coronavirus.\u0026nbspThe man was arrested and charged with mischief after the flight from Toronto to Jamaica returned to the airport, police said.\u0026nbspJulie-Anne Broderick, a passenger on the plane, said she saw the man taking a selfie and announcing he had the virus.The flight attendants came, gave him a mask and gloves and just told him that he had to move to the back of the plane, she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\u0026nbspThe captain then told passengers he thought the incident was a hoax but had to return to Toronto, she added.France\u0027s government has joined Britain in warning against any non-essential travel to China and suggesting all of its citizens leave while the virus is still spreading.\u0026nbspThe Foreign Ministry issued the travel warning\u0026nbspbased on measures taken by Chinese authorities, and on the evolution of the epidemic.\u0026nbspFrance has six confirmed cases of the virus and evacuated hundreds of people on two flights.The Department of Health has said 414 people have tested negative for coronavirus as of Tuesday.\u0026nbspTwo patients with the virus are still being treated in Newcastle.Uzbekistan has evacuated 250 people from China and will place them in quarantine when they arrive in Taskhent, the country\u0027s state airline has said.\u0026nbspUzbekistan Airways said in a statement the passengers were being accompanied by doctors and specialists with protective equipment.A 23-year-old British man who believes he has contracted the coronavirus is trapped alone in the locked-down city of Wuhan and fears he may be left behind by the British authorities.Jamie Morris, from New Tredegar in south Wales, fears\u0026nbsphe may have contracted the virus at the end of November, before the mass outbreak prompted global media attention.They diagnosed me as having potential pneumonia but couldn\u0027t confirm it, he told the PA news agency.\u0026nbspI had all the symptoms, literally everything that has been said by the government, however it was before the virus was made public knowledge.There is a high possibility of it being so, but thanks to my high immune system, I managed to beat it back.\u0026nbspHe said he had not been able to get on the flights back to the UK because he had recently given his passport to the Chinese government to lengthen his residency permit.\u0026nbspThe news of a British evacuation came very quickly, leaving many people who lived a fair distance from the airport unable to make the flight, Mr Morris said.Royal Caribbean\u0026nbsphas cancelled eight cruises which were due to depart from\u0026nbspChina in the next month.The company – which already cancelled three trips scheduled for February after consulation with health authorities – said it expects the cancellations and some modifications to its itineraries to reduce earnings by 25 cents per share.Royal Caribbean also said it would deny boarding to people who had visited mainland China or Hong Kong over the past 15 days. It will also screen Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders and people showing flu-like symptoms.\u0026nbspThe decision comes as thousands of\u0026nbsppassengers and crew on a US-operated cruise ship are tested for the coronavirus\u0026nbspin Japan after one passenger was found to have contracted the virus.Japanese health officials are\u0026nbspconducting extensive medical checks on all 3,700 passengers and crew of a cruise ship that returned to the country after one passenger tested positive for the new coronavirus.\u0026nbspA number of people on board are ill, officials have said,\u0026nbspthough no one else has yet tested positive for the fast-spreading virus.\u0026nbspThe US-operated Diamond Princess returned to a port in Yokohama, near Tokyo, late on Monday, ending a 14-day tour during which it stopped at Hong Kong and several other Asian ports before returning to Japan.\u0026nbspJapanese government and tour company officials say they were notified by Hong Kong that an 80-year-old male passenger who got off the boat on the island tested positive for the virus.A coronavirus vaccine is a long way off, a health expert has warned.\u0026nbspSuch a vaccine will not be ready in time for the current outbreak said David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\u0026nbspA vaccine is a long way off, Prof Heymann told a briefing at Chatham House in London. There will not be a vaccine probably to deal with this outbreak, but there is work being done on coronavirus vaccines in general. I\u0027m confident that there will one day be a coronavirus vaccine.\u0026nbspHe continued: Sars caused major outbreaks when it was exported from China, major hospital outbreaks - that hasn\u0027t yet happened in this outbreak, this disease so that\u0027s one point to compare.That\u0027s not to say it won\u0027t happen in the future but it hasn\u0027t happened yet. The world is much more prepared to deal with these things now than it was then.More than 100 Malaysians have been quarantined after being evacuated from Wuhan.An AirAsia plane carrying 107 Malaysians and their non-Malaysian\u0026nbspspouses and children landed at the Kuala Lumpur airport early on Tuesday.They immediately underwent medical screenings, and the National Disaster Management Agency said two people who did not pass the screenings were immediately taken to the hospital.Medical workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike for a second day to demand the border with mainland China is shut completely in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\u0026nbspAll but two of Hong Kong\u0027s land and sea crossings with the mainland were closed at midnight after more than 2,000 hospital workers went on strike on Monday.\u0026nbspBut on Tuesday, health authorities reported two additional patients without any known travel to the virus epicenter, bringing the number of locally-transmitted cases up to four.\u0026nbspAccording to the Hospital Authority Employees\u0027 Alliance, the strike organizer, more than 7,000 members joined the strike to demand closure of the border across which tens of thousands of people continue to travel daily.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anti-Brexit comedian Nish Kumar hosted the Horrible Histories “special” song on CBBC, branded on Twitter as “British things . . . turns out there’s hardly any”.Its desperately unfunny attempt to present a “woke“ version of history by sending up the Royal Family while highlighting the slave trade was little more than thinly-veiled propaganda.It is grotesque that children should be subjected to such brainwashing.BRITS stranded in snake flu-ridden China have been going through hell.So it’s bizarre that our man in Wuhan had flown back home just as the deadly epidemic swept through the area.Consul Gareth Hoar apparently boarded a plane hours before the city went into lockdown when it should have been blindingly obvious that an emergency was developing.So which bungler thought it was a good idea to let the consul come home before stranded Britons Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But experts say it is about ,.Most of them are radicalised in the murky backwaters of the dark web and carry out their attacks alone using everyday items as weapons.All that means keeping us safe has become a near impossible task.Yet when a maniac launched himself at two passers-by in Streatham yesterday, plain-clothed police were on the scene immediately. And within minutes, the assailant had been shot dead.The police and MI don’t always get it right. Which is hardly surprising, given it takes about  people to monitor just one suspect properly.But most of the time — against the odds — they do. And we should thank our lucky stars for that.WE never thought that the EU would play fair throughout the trade negotiations.The waning institution is desperate to stop other countries following where Britain has led, and desperate people lash out. But we didn’t bargain for dirty tactics in week one. We were naive.After promising to consider a Canada-style free trade agreement with the UK as part of the WithdrawalAgreement, EU officials are already shamelessly back-pedalling. To secure a deal, they now say we must follow all the bloc’s regulatory rules.They must have known Boris Johnson would never agree to this bizarre bid. Aligning with Europe on everything would entirely defeat the point of Brexit.But they hoped that by showing some muscle, they could make the PM quake with fear and give them the upper hand.It was a woeful miscalculation.Unlike his predecessor, Mr Johnson believes in the UK whole-heartedly. And he has no qualms about telling bullies where to stick it.Brussels had better up its game: independent Britain is a force to be reckoned with.DOES the BBC have a death wish The latest Horrible Histories “comedy” video kicks sand in the faces of ordinary, patriotic Brits.Its warped version of history misses out Britain winning two world wars, a World Cup, dominating global music charts for decades, and creating many of the greatest TV shows of all time.Why  Because for the ultra-liberal BBC, Britain bashing has become a sport.We’ve always felt a certain affection for our state broadcaster. It’s done some cracking work in its time.Butit carries on trying to alienate our children from their own country, it’s doomed.

He was considered a success story of a Cambridge University rehab programme, having befriended staff including of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones, who he later stabbed to death before he was shot dead by police on London Bridge in December.He was arrested in  and given an indeterminate sentence which was changed to a fixed-term -year sentence on appeal in , meaning he was eligible for early release.Bangladeshi-born Shah Rahman, , was part of the terror cell that Khan belonged to which plotted to bomb London’s Stock Exchange.He was sentenced to “at least  years” in .It’s unclear as to when he was released on licence.Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan was arrested in May  immediately after being interviewed on BBC Newsnight and claiming his pal, Michael Adebolajo , was offered a job by MI.Abdullah-Hassan, who was involved with Anjem Choudary’s hate group al-Muhajiroun, was jailed in  for three years for inciting terrorism.It is unclear when he was released.Rebekah Dawson was sentenced to  months in  for posting clips on YouTube glorying the horric murder of Lee Rigby.Dawson, who hailed from Hackney in east London and was  when she was convicted, also made headlines by refusing to remove her face veil.The religious row broke out during Dawsons trial for a separate offence - witness intimidation.She ultimately pleaded guilty to that charge and was sentenced to six months in prison.Rebekah Dawson’s husband, Royal Barnes, was also convicted for videos mocking Lee Rigby’s death.He was handed five years and four months.In one clip, Dawson filmed Barnes laughing as he drove past floral tributes to Rigby.Rasmus was jailed in November  after being caught hiding in a truck at Dover.He’d stowed himself away in a bid to try to join Islamic State.

So theyre angry, theyre likely to lash out.“When you look at the detail of these last two attacks, its  not organised. Its about flailing about with anger.”One in seven of the convicted terrorists released since  had their sentences reduced or were freed through the early release system.But Dr Stott says that in some cases, prison is strengthening radical views.“With the networks within prisons like-minded people can associate together and reinforce those views,” he says.“We saw that during the conflict in Northern Ireland and I think were clearly seeing it again, with the jihadi prisoners. They are providing mutual support for one another in prison so theyre not being reformed.”But he says terrorists like Amman are acting alone, with no backing from formal organisations.Its a dferent type of terrorism from what we might have seen in earlier decades where its much more centrally directed. These people are taking inspiration from them and then acting themselves.Cardf Student Iqbal called himself “the father of terrorism” and posted over  links to extremist material online.Birmingham postie Mohammed Benares, one of Choudarys henchmen, was caged for two years in  after downloading an online al-Qaeda magazine glorying terrorism.The -year-old was arrested with  copies of Inspire, which detailed how to make bombs and plan atrocities.Police also found copies of a document called  Ways to Serve and Participate in Jihad and speeches by al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.Benares claimed to be “researching” extremism, but was convicted of possessing terrorist information at London’s Southwark Crown Court.Despite the shocking offence, he was released well before his sentence was up.Another of the cell jailed for the Stock Exchange plot with Usman Khan, Rahman was sentenced to five years, in , after admitting to owning copies of an al-Qaeda magazine for terrorist purposes, which included a recipe for a pipe bomb.Released “six months early” because his lawyer argued he was undertaking “de-radicalisation” in jail, he was jailed again in August  for plotting a “mass casualty attack” targeting police or military with two other men.They were caught when a sting operation found a partially complete pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the Arabic word for “nonbeliever” in the car of one of the co-conspirators, Naweed Ali.He’s currently serving le with a minimum of  years over the  conviction.Lat was also part of the Stock Exchange plot and was sentenced to ten years and four months in , plus five more on extended licence.The Mirror reported that he was freed last year.Hussain was freed on December ,  after just  months of a three-year sentence for disseminating terrorist material and encouraging terrorism.

He has since been sacked.The convicted terrorists and extremists back walking our streets could soon be joined by a new wave of dangerous characters.Other jihadi lags are expected to be released from prison on licence in upcoming months - including Sheffield con Khalil Maher, , who tried to secretly travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.Maher - who was arrested at Heathrow Airport - was jailed for five years, four months, in November , but is understood to be due out of prison later this month after serving just half his sentence.And Sunderland shopkeeper Mohammed Zahir Khan, , is thought to be due for release in the next few months, too - despite being jailed for more than four years in May  for posting support for ISIS online.Sundays Streatham attack has shone a light on the UKs automatic early release laws - which have been slammed for leaving our neighbourhoods unsafe and allowing jihadists to ignite terror across the nation.ButPM Boris Johnson gets his way, the waves of convicted terrorists ing to the streets could soon become trickles, or nothing at all.Vowing to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners, Mr Johnson said today: I think the question that everybody has about the inidual concerned [in the Streatham attack] is, what was he doing out on automatic early release, and why was there no system of scrutiny, no parole system, to check whether he was really a suitable candidate for automatic early release.And that is a very complex legal question. We do think its time to take action.I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system.UNDER British law, criminals serving a determinate – or fixed – sentence of less than four years are automatically released from prison halfway through their term.They then spend the remaining half of their sentence on licence, during which they must adhere to certain conditions like good behaviour and staying in touch with their probation officer.This has been the case since , when the provisions of the  Criminal Justice Act were implemented.Lags serving a determinate sentence of more than four years can also be released at the halfway point, but this doesnt happen automatically - a parole board must agree to it.In the cases of those serving an indeterminate - non-fixed - or le sentence, the UK Government has to apply for parole on the prisoners behalf.The intention of early release is to rehabilitate prisoners in the community while managing the populations inside Britain’s overcrowded prisons.However, recent atrocities, including the Streatham stabbing yesterday afternoon and the deadly London Bridge attack in November, have raised questions about the rules.Streatham attacker Sudesh Amman had been released on licence last month, and is reported to have been living in a bail hostel in south London, with an electronic tag fitted.It is also understood he was under -hour police surveillance – something that comes at a huge cost. One retired police detective said yesterday it takes a team of  officers to carry out round-the-clock surveillance on an inidual target.Meanwhile, London Bridge attacker Usman Khan was a convicted terrorist who was on probation after being freed halfway through his sentence under automatic early release rules.In the wake of the November attack, the Government proposed a raft of changes, including scrapping early release for offenders classed as dangerous, giving those convicted of serious crimes like preparing acts of terrorism a minimum of  years behind bars, and forcing dangerous terrorists who receive extended determinate sentences to serve the whole time in prison.Under the Counter TerrorismBill, offenders not classed as dangerous would also be expected to serve two thirds of their sentences – rather than just half – while the number of counter-terrorism probation officers would be doubled.Today, PM Boris Johnson made a fresh vow to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners following the Streatham kne rampage – although it’s not clear how any changes would be applied to existing cases.We are bringing forward legislation to stop the system of automatic early release. The dficulty is how to apply retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualy, said Mr Johnson.It is time to take action to ensure, irrespective of the law we are bringing in, people in the current stream dont qualy automatically for early release.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Government we have had some good discussions, but they will not be easy either.He added: The alternative would make me feel very uncomfortable.A pilot is still ongoing in Harrogate which is putting people from the old system to the new one - and ministers are mulling how to roll it out nationwide.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Caitlin struck up a romance with a man on the dating app, describing him as aposamazing and well manneredapos. He told her he had a farm and a golden retriever called Bear, and after three months of seeing each other he had convinced her she had found what she was looking for - but Caitlinaposs detective work saw his web of lies unravel. One day the man aposcompletely ghostedapos her and Caitlin simply accepted it and moved on, putting it down as just another internet dating disaster. But then he got back in touch in an attempt to explain himself and the move proved to be a huge mistake. He told Caitlin he was going to London to see his friend who was having a baby, which she thought was weird but, again, shrugged it off. Baffled and asking her co-workers for help, she gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking it may be an exaposs baby or that he was a sperm donor, but her colleagues immediately told her it was a aposbig red flagapos.They asked Caitlinshe knew anything about the baby or his connection to it, and she told News.auaposs Married at First Sight podcast that it gave her a light bulb moment.I saved some d*** pics he sent me on my phone, she explained. Apple has this wonderful thing where they geo tag all your photos and so I found the little country town he was from.I typed his first name and country town into Google and up popped his wedding photos. Hoping it was something resigned to the past and he had since moved on, Caitlin and her work friends tracked down the Facebook page of the wedding photographer, leading to the manaposs - still very much current - weaposs profile."},{"url":null,"title":"beautician sues tui 8500 after","story":"w.mantis  Beautician sues TUI for £, after food poisoning leaves her in wheelchair n Jenner Irving, of

Pictures and footage on social media show the empty corridors, deserted lounges and barren deck of the Diamond Princess. The ship is in quarantine in Yokohama, Japan, after it emerged a coronavirus patient spent a few days on the vessel. Masked health workers clad in blue plastic gowns have been spotted roaming around the ship, while passengers stayed confined to their rooms. British passenger David Abel said a newcomer would be shocked to discover there are actually , people aboard. He said some of his fellow passengers aposdonapost give a damn about personal hygieneapos and slammed an American who had potentially spread germs at the dinner table. Mr Abel added that medics had screened everybody after it came to light that an infected passenger flew into Tokyo and boarded the vessel. Japanese authorities are racing to contain a potential spread of the superbug by isolating the ship and the thousands of people onboard. The Diamond Princess ended its planned -day cruise early and is now docked off the coast of Yokohama. Mr Abel added: The only checks are hygiene at food time. Other than that staff are going about their business. You would not be aware there are , people onboard, that’s for sure. Staff are constantly cleaning and sanitizing public areas such as handrails and door handles. Passengers are requested not to use public toilets unless in emergency. The results from the health ‘samples’ taken will not be available until midnight. We are still anchored in the bay. The next announcement will be around : am local time. Nobody is able to book onward flights as we have no idea when quarantine will clear. An -year-old man, who was later diagnosed with coronavirus, boarded Carnival Japan Incaposs ship, in Yokohama on January  and disembarked in Hong Kong on January . When the news emerged the ship was quarantined and guests underwent tests.

one of the coronavirus symptoms is shortness of breathShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  FEB NewsMichael wants to try and get his family back to the UK \" to FREE daily email alerts

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British dad says his family is stuck in China as they canapost collect their passports from the British embassy because itaposs always aposshutapos. Teacher Michael Mireku moved to Beijing from Loughton, Essex, last July for work.But after the outbreak of coronavirus the -year-old, along with his we Akos, , and children Nessya, , and Ely, eight, are desperate toto the UK.His we and daughteraposs renewed passports are in the Beijing embassy and theyaposve been unable to get hold of them. Michael says despite advice from UK officials that offices are open, every time he tries to get in touch they are closed. He says his son has asthma and they are worriedhe has an episode he will be admitted to hospital and treated for the wrong thing - as one of the coronavirus symptoms is shortness of breath. Michael described the situation as extremely stressful and claims they have exhausted all options to try and get out of China, as advised by the UK government. Speaking exclusively to Mirror, Michael said: We canapost get anyone to speak to us just to collect the passports and leave. I have tried everything. Itaposs been very stressful. The plan was to leave on Saturday but this wasnapost possible as we havenapost been able to get in touch with anyone here in Beijing to collect our passports or even the possibility to get an emergency travel document. The frustrating part is that all calls made here say the offices are closed even though on their website it says they must be open. My son has asthma and the fear is thathe should have any issues he might be treated for something completely dferent as he will be presenting signs of the virus. He is usually hospitalised when he suffers an episode but I donapost want that to happen here. As he has an underlying issue I need to get out soon but this is not possible because the embassy is not working. The main stress is they have advised us to leavewe can before it gets dficult to leave. Just now I have received breaking news advising nationals to leavethey are able to. We just want to come back [to the UK] until everything dies down. Schools are closed now so thereaposs no point being here.  But he said the main fear for them is their son, adding we donapost want anything to happen. Michael said his we and daughter sent their passports off for renewal on January , before the coronavirus outbreak hit China. He believes the British embassy offices in Beijing shut on January  for the Chinese New Year holidays but hasnapost seen them open since, despite advice from UK officials. My we and daughter renewed their passports. According to HMPOthey were printed off on the th, he told. The assumption is that they should be here by now as itaposs sent off by DHL, but the visa office is closed to collect the passports. Weaposve tried all avenues for information on how to collect them but no luck. The message on the embassy phone says they are closed even though I got a message from the FCO today that they are open today. Iaposve been calling since the th of January but calls are being erted to the crisis centre in London who are not able to give us any help from here. The embassy advice is to leave while you can as it may become impossible later but they are rather sending their staff away and not helping on how nationals anywhere  can get help. He added: We just need help to collect our passports so we can leave. The FCO is advising us to collect an emergency travel document, but yet again their offices are closed here to be able to get that too. Andwe even manage to get that, we need to collect an exit visa to leave which will take another five to seven working days. With the current situation and the fact the offices are still closed, that will even take longer to get as there is every chance there will be a backlog to go through. Michael says they donapost go out anywhere at the moment unless they need to get food, and says others are trying to stay indoors as well amid the outbreak.

But every so often, among the things which ide us, small moments can show us that humanity isnapost too bad afterall. London is famed for its antisocial inhabitants, and anyone from the north will be quick to tell you that no one even says hello when you get on the tube. So when a man sitting alone on a bench begins to sing, you would rightly expect a park full of strangers to handle it in the only way the British know how - avoiding eye contact, carrying on asit wasnapost happening and hoping it stops as soon as possible. But instead an incredible moment was caught on camera, racking up over a million views and leading others to label it the aposclosest humanity has gotten towards world peaceapos.The man begins to belt out Jon Bon Joviaposs classic Livinapos On A Prayer, as his brilliant voice carries over the humdrum noise of hundreds of strangers sitting on the grass surrounding him in a park close to Embankment station on the Thames. His impromptu concert seems to go largely unnoticed until he reaches the chorus - at which point his lone voice is joined by hundreds of others as the park suddenly becomes alive with the sound of aposOhh, weaposre halfway thereapos as drinks are raised towards the sky. The man then raises his own can to the backing vocalists in the most heartwarming nod of appreciation between hundreds of strangers you are ever likely to see. The camera pans round to show the sheer volume of people who became caught in the moment themselves, proving the singeraposs brave impulse to be worth the risk and a thousand times more.

He was told in September that year he would not face charges.  nThen , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , .  nThe Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he felt sick and panicked and ran off after seeing the body.  nLast year, he spoke about Mr Lubbockaposs death, telling Piers Morganaposs ITV show Le Stories that he couldnapost be more sorry for his behaviour that night.  n  n  nThe one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  per cent innocent.  nBarrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only nominal damages.  nHis career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbockaposs death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the showaposs bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist.  nJonathan Kenney  n  n   nKenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymoreaposs boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago.  nHe was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June .  nThree months later, he was told he would not be charged.  nKenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits.  nHe told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbockaposs body was found.  nJustin Merritt  n  n   nMerritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymoreaposs home.  nIn September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool.  nMerritt told the hearing: He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing.  n   nTop news stories from n   nHe claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding: He said there was a geezer floating in the pool.  nMerritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am.  nHe was later arrested and released without charge.  nKylie Merritt  n  n   nAt the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justinaposs younger sister - said she didnapost see an assault on Mr Lubbock.  nShe had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening.  nKelly Campbell  nLike most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening.  nSimon Shaw  n  n   nShaw was a friend of Barrymoreaposs and a local resident.  nHe told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock.  nHe said: I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again.  nI grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me.  nHe left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbockaposs body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard.  nJames Futers  n  n   nFuters was a local resident and chef.  nExplaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest: I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around.  nHe had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am.  nFuters told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a drunken chat before they found his body.  nHe said: We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom.  n  n   nBy the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard.  nClaire Jones  nJones was -years-old when she attended the party.  nShe worked locally as a cashier.  nShe had only met Barrymore for the first time that night.  nCause of death aposunknownapos  nThe inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him.  nA coroner ruled the cause of death as unascertainable and an open verdict was recorded.  nOn Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene.  n  nBut he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years.  nHe added: We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does.  nWe want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing.  nSome people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuartaposs death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them.  n  nIt is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night.  naposCome cleanapos  nMr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, is confident his sonaposs killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key.  nHe said: I think itaposs time he comes clean. Itaposs time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you.  nItaposs time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know.  nMr Lubbock added: The pennyaposs dropped now, itaposs time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved.

He was told in September that year he would not face charges. nThen , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , . nThe Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he  \"felt sick \" and  \"panicked and ran off \" after seeing the body. nLast year, he spoke about Mr Lubbocks death, telling Piers Morgans ITV show Le Stories that he  \"couldnt be more sorry \" for his behaviour that night. nThe one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  \" per cent innocent \". nBarrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only  \"nominal \" damages. nHis career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbocks death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the shows bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist. nKenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymores boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago. nHe was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June . nThree months later, he was told he would not be charged. nKenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits. nHe told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbocks body was found. nMerritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymores home. nIn September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool. nMerritt told the hearing:  \"He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing. \" n Top news stories from nHe claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding:  \"He said there was a geezer floating in the pool. \" nMerritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am. nHe was later arrested and released without charge. nAt the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justins younger sister - said she didnt see an assault on Mr Lubbock. nShe had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening. nLike most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening. nShaw was a friend of Barrymores and a local resident. nHe told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock. nHe said:  \"I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again. n \"I grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me. \" nHe left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbocks body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard. nFuters was a local resident and chef. nExplaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest:  \"I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around. \" nHe had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am. nFuters told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a  \"drunken \" chat before they found his body. nHe said:  \"We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom. \" nBy the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard. nJones was -years-old when she attended the party. nShe worked locally as a cashier. nShe had only met Barrymore for the first time that night. nThe inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him. nA coroner ruled the cause of death as  \"unascertainable \" and an open verdict was recorded. nOn Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene. nBut he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years. nHe added:  \"We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does. n \"We want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing. n \"Some people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuarts death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them. n \"It is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night. \" nMr Lubbocks father, Terry, is confident his sons killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key. nHe said:  \"I think its time he comes clean. Its time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you. n \"Its time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know. \" nMr Lubbock added:  \"The pennys dropped now, its time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved. Any bit of information they have got, they must come forward with that. \" nHe called for a fresh post-mortem and inquest for his son, while Mr Jennings said Stuarts injuries were too severe to have been consensual or self-inflicted, and suggested he may have been held down. nThe officer said:  \"I cant rule out a single inidual was responsible for the sexual assault and causing Stuarts death. n \"I would say on the balance of probabilities and all of the evidence and intelligence that we have, that its more likely more than one person was involved. \" nThe documentary tells the story of the death through interviews with journalists, forensics experts and people who knew Stuart. nAt the beginning of the -minute programme, the  call reporting the incident to police is played. nThe caller said:  \"A fella has drowned in the pool.

Dad-of-two Mr Lubbock, , was found dead in an outdoor swimming pool at Barrymoreaposs £million mansion in Roydon, Essex, on March , , after being seriously sexually assaulted. Barrymore, now , and two other men - his ex-lover Jonathan Kenney and dustman Justin Merritt - were arrested and later released without charge, and police say the three have not been completely eliminated from inquiries. Five others who were at the party that night - Merritt’s younger sister Kylie, chef James Futers, and locals Simon Shaw, Claire Jones, then , and Kelly Campbell - have also not been eliminated, according to police  Before the screening of a new Channel  documentary on the case, Mr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, , said he believes Barrymore knows more than he has revealed. He has called for the entertainer to clear your name or put your hands up as Essex Police offer a £, reward for information. On Monday, Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Jennings told reporters that it is likely that at least two people were involved, adding: “One or more of the eight people at this party are responsible for Stuart’s death.” He also said: I believe that he [Stuart] was raped and murdered that night. In September , an inquest found that Mr Lubbock had cocaine and ecstasy in his system, and had drunk the equivalent of nine pints of beer the night he died. With plenty of unanswered questions still lingering, here is a look at the five men and three women who were at the party. Michael Barrymore  Barrymore, born Michael Parker, was arrested on suspicion of serious sexual assault and murder in June . He was told in September that year he would not face charges. Then , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , . The Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he felt sick and panicked and ran off after seeing the body. Last year, he spoke about Mr Lubbockaposs death, telling Piers Morganaposs ITV show Le Stories that he couldnapost be more sorry for his behaviour that night.  The one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  per cent innocent. Barrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only nominal damages. His career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbockaposs death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the showaposs bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist. Jonathan Kenney  Kenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymoreaposs boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago. He was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June . Three months later, he was told he would not be charged. Kenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits. He told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbockaposs body was found. Justin Merritt  Merritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymoreaposs home. In September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool. Merritt told the hearing: He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing.  He claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding: He said there was a geezer floating in the pool. Merritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am. He was later arrested and released without charge. Kylie Merritt  At the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justinaposs younger sister - said she didnapost see an assault on Mr Lubbock. She had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening. Simon Shaw  Shaw was a friend of Barrymoreaposs and a local resident. He told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock. He said: I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again. I grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me. He left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbockaposs body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard. James Futers  Futers was a local resident and chef. Explaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest: I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around. He had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am. Futers told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a drunken chat before they found his body. He said: We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom.  By the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard. Claire Jones Jones was -years-old when she attended the party. She worked locally as a cashier. She had only met Barrymore for the first time that night. Kelly Campbell Like most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening. She was a friend of fellow party guest Claire Jones. Cause of death aposunknownapos The inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him. A coroner ruled the cause of death as unascertainable and an open verdict was recorded. On Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene.  But he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years. He added: We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does. We want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing. Some people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuartaposs death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them.  It is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night. aposCome cleanapos Mr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, is confident his sonaposs killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key. He said: I think itaposs time he comes clean. Itaposs time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you. Itaposs time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know. Mr Lubbock added: The pennyaposs dropped now, itaposs time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved. Any bit of information they have got, they must come forward with that.

Kate Ingram Woolf had always dreamed of having a huge brood. After the -year-old had two children with her first husband in the mid s, she was devastated when she miscarried after trying for number three. But  years later she has finally given birth to her fth and final child after two decades of trying - and a further  pregnancies, of which  ended in heartbreak. While cradling her six-month-old daughter Edith, Kate said she couldnapost be happier and couldnapost believe she has the family she fantasised about as a teenager. Kate, from Herefordshire, said: I had always wanted a big family and when I was going through the miscarriages, it just made me want children even more. I became obsessed with wanting a bigger family. After going through  miscarriages, I just wanted to keep on trying and hoped that one day I would have my perfect little family that I do now. I hated being pregnant because I was so scared of what might happen and I just wasnapost convinced that it was real. I had to have scans every two weeks to help settle my mind and reassure me that everything was okay. My husband Steve, was excited but I didnapost want to get too excited because I didnapost believe it.  After my miscarriages, I suffered from postnatal depression despite never giving birth because my hormones were all over the place. I canapost believe Edith is here and healthy and I finally have my perfect family I had always dreamed of. Kate began trying for a third child in  after having two successful pregnancies - Jasmine,  and Kristopher,  - with her first husband. Over the next  years Kate suffered  miscarriages and had  more successful pregnancies with several partners. She orced her first husband and went on to have one child, Freya,  with her next partner. Shortly after, Kate split from her partner and went on to have Olivia, .  Kate, who has been married for three years to her current partner, Steve, , finally got the news she had been waiting for since they married in . She was pregnant again with a baby girl and in August , Kate gave birth to healthy baby Edith. Kate and her self-employed carpenter husband first began trying for a baby in . While she already has four children from previous relationships, she wanted a baby with Steve to create her dream family. After having two children with her first husband, Kate tried for baby number three which is when she began miscarrying. Sadly between  and , the enthusiastic mum suffered  miscarriages which led to the breakdown of her marriage.  After Kateaposs first miscarriage in , a number of tests were done but they all came back with the all-clear, leading Kate to believe it was aposjust one of those thingsapos. Finally in , Kate got pregnant with her third child Freya. Kate said: I was terried when I was pregnant because I never believed that it was real and I always thought I would lose it again. I wish I could have been excited but it was impossible given the circumstances. It was only after the th miscarriage, that doctors ran more tests and found that Kate had a bicornuate uterus which could causes an increased risk for recurrent miscarriage. I had been blaming myself for so long, thinking that I had done something wrong, so to find out that this could be the reason behind it was both relieving but sad because there was nothing I could do about it now, she said. During Kateaposs first marriage, she suffered a late miscarriage which led to the breakdown of her relationship. Kate said, I found out I had lost the baby at  weeks and that was probably the hardest one for me.  I had to go and sit in a hospital room surrounded by all of these women who were pregnant and be told that my baby was no longer alive. It was definitely part of the reason why my first marriage came to an end- I became obsessed with getting pregnant and it was all I wanted. Between  and , Kate had two more miscarriages with her current partner, leading them to want to give up trying. We were absolutely devastated but we decided we would try again and thataposs how Edith was born, she added. In August , Kate and Steve finally had their wishes answered when a healthy baby girl was born.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman jumped  feet to her death from the balcony of her luxury apartment block shortly after beginning a new le in China. Gill Smith, , had seemed happy after setting up home in a wealthy part of Shanghai with managing director husband Peter and their two young sons, an inquest heard. Prior to her death she got herself in a hole and took her own le in a moment of madness, the hearing in Stockport, Greater Manchester was told. On July  last year Mrs Smith, formerly of Bramhall, near Stockport, fell  floors from the family home near the Huangpu River after sending her sons to have lunch with their father. She suffered multiple injuries and was found in the grounds of the apartment complex in the Weang Xincun area of the city. The waist-high metal and glass  surrounding the edges of the balcony would have required Mrs Smith to use a stool to step over them, the inquest heard. After her death police officers found passwords to her phone which contained a suicide note. The mum-of-two had seemed quiet in the weeks before her death and had been unable to get out of bed on some days.  The family were due to fly out to Spain to start the childrenaposs summer holidays before heading back to the UK to visit family. Mr Smith, managing director of recruitment firm Michael Page China, told the hearing: I knew she wasnapost her normal self over the two weeks prior to her death. She became quiet and wasnapost her normal self in terms of chatting when I would get back in the evening. I did specically ask her three times what was wrong and I sat with her and asked whataposs going on, itaposs not right. And she said nothing was going on. The father-of-two went on to recall the last time he spoke to his we. My last conversation was over the phone she phoned to say I have just put the boys in a car and they will be with you in  minutes, he said.  When it was the school holidays they would come and see me and we would got something to eat as I did a lot of travelling. A meal had been arranged earlier in the week and at one point Gill was going to come. I didnapost notice anything unusual. I know on the Monday she had stayed in bed all day. I had gone to work and she was in bed and I came back and she said she didnapost feel up for getting up and wanted to watch TV. Recalling the day of the tragedy, he added: As we finished lunch and were coming down in the elevator a text message came through. As soon as I got that message we set off back home.  I phoned my PA to try to phone the building and get someone to get up to the apartment.phoned my friendaposs we. My friendaposs we was sat with Gill and my PA phoned me really upset and saying she was so sorry. Gill had never talked about doing anything like this before, but weirdly enough there had been a few suicides in Shanghai over the last year and it had been a topic of conversation at a BBQ we were at four weeks before. She just got herself into a hole and I donapost think she meant it. I think it was just a moment of madness.  After the tragedy unfolded police found Mrs Smithaposs phone and a piece of paper with passwords written on it. This led them to uncover a saved draft email which explained her reasons for taking her own le and how she was sorry for doing so. Recording a conclusion of suicide due to multiple injuries caused by her fall, Coroner Alison Mutch said: Clearly Mrs Smith along with her family led a very happy le in China where they where living at the time. They had a very close family with two children that she clearly thought the world of. It is clear from all the messages I have seen that her family were a huge part of her le and she cared immensely for her family. Itaposs clear on the evidence before this court that in the short time proceeding her death she had become quite distressed and quieter than usual.  Itaposs dficult to understand what was going through her mind at the time, she clearly didnapost want to talk about it. It is clear from the notes that where recovered that she felt she was in a situation that for reasons not entirely clear she felt was not resolvable.

into an aposevilapos Gay Pride parade as a shortcut to paradise, a court heard.  nMohiussunnath Chowdhury, , also singled out Madam Tussauds and a double decker tourist bus as targets, Woolwich Crown Court heard.  nIt was part of his plan to unleash death and suffering on non-Muslim members of the public, it is claimed.  nJurors heard Chowdhury was cleared of preparing to commit an act of terrorism in December  after waving a sword at police outside Buckingham Palace.  nHe is now standing trial for engaging in the preparation of acts of terrorism and his sister, Sneha Chowdhury, , is accused of two charges of failing to noty the authorities of a potential terror attack.  n n  nChowdhuryaposs plans were foiled by three undercover officers posing as like-minded extremists.  nHe sent letters to his sister with quotes justying what he had done showing he was the same man in  as he was when he was prosecuted in , it is claimed.  nIn his closing speech prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: He wrote about aposparadise under the shades of swordsapos and wanting to discuss this with an imam.  nThe crossover, the common factors between those that he posted in  that show he was the same man with the same inspirations as .  nThe Black Sahaba story, tale of gaining paradise by fighting disbelievers and being killed in the end, he posted that within days of being released from prison.  nUndercover officer Mikael provided a signicant portion of the evidence against Chowdury, made through covert recordings.  nWithin days of first meeting with undercover officers and within no time when he learned Mikael was about to become a martyr, Mr Atkinson said.  n n  nIn his interview he denied his postings were designed to encourage terror, rather general Islamic conversation, discussing both the nice and the not nice.  nButyou look at what he posted, it was not debate it was evangelising, advancing his view.  nIt was a nonsensical explanation you may think, that he was posting to confirm, in prison, despite himself he couldnapost help himself just a habit, boasting to friends who knew what he was saying and to everyone in his family and home.  nIn  he was still listening to the sermons of Muslim cleric Anwar Awlaki, who he told undercover officers he played for inspiration while he drove to Buckingham Palace in .  nOn  March he played and sent Islamic State propaganda videos calling for battle between believers and non-believers, the court heard.  nMr Atkinson said: He told you that he agreed with what Sheikh Faisal [Abdullah el-Faisal] had to say, he was sending them to undercover officers to educate them, you may think he was seeking to encourage those he sent them to support the views he expressed and shared.  nHe was attracted to Tommy

It was part of his plan to unleash death and suffering on non-Muslim members of the public, it is claimed. Jurors heard Chowdhury was cleared of preparing to commit an act of terrorism in December  after waving a sword at police outside Buckingham Palace. He is now standing trial for engaging in the preparation of acts of terrorism and his sister, Sneha Chowdhury, , is accused of two charges of failing to noty the authorities of a potential terror attack.

The recordings read: Heaposll give you his paradise, what you have to do you have to fight, you kill and then they are killed, it doesnapost get much clearer than that does it  Allah says its a bargain, itaposs just a few minutes fighting you kill and you are killed, every road has a shortcut, and a shortcut to Islam is a jihad.apos Chowdury considered targeting of Londonaposs gay pride parade with a van after realising attacking remembrance Sunday was too dficult due to security. He believed it was aposhalal permittedapos for jihadis to target gays. Mikael brought it up again to find outserious or not, affording him chance to say he was joking, said the prosecutor. He gave him a chance to back off, on the th of April he says he wants to wait, he thinks not ready yet.

Evidence shows slits and slashes on side of wardrobe, his sister told you were only visible when inside his room, less likely to attract notice of others, particularly his father who had earlier taken away his bokken. Mr Atkinson said the sister was well aware what of Chowdury was plotting. How likely is it that these would forget acting with a bokkenwith him and a kitchen kne with him, he asked. Is it a lack of memory or is it evasion  Was she simply not telling the police in interview the truth  She knew better than anyone, sat through both trials, she would have known what her brother had done, he drove to Windsor, he drove to Buckingham palace, with a sword.

While forecasts last week the country set for imminent snow, new analysis from weather radars suggests this is no longer the case.Temperatures will, in fact, remain mild for the coming days, even peaking at C in places in the southwest on Friday.Then monster gales of up to mph will lash across the country.Speaking totoday, Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: It will get colder next week but it is too early to forecast whether thereaposll be snow or what temperatures we should expect.We can only say with a great deal of uncertainty what the weather may be at this early stage.Polar maritime air moving in from the north will cause temperatures to fall. There is potential for some snow in parts of the north but thataposs not a certainty by any means. Itaposll remain mild this week and on Saturday and Sunday potentially. Temperatures will be in double figures for most of the country before then, around  or C in places. There is potential for heavy rain though when it becomes windier.  As we go through the next few days, it is likely the weather warning for wind will be refined or trimmed down somewhat as it is too early to tell where itaposll be at its worst at the moment unfortunately. There is potential for weather warnings for rain too. The unsettled pattern should remain for the rest of the month, forecasters add.

The rare sighting was captured by safari guide Kurt Schultz on Saturday in Kruger National Park, South Africa, while he was photographing lions. As Kurt, , sat with his finger poised on the camera, he at first feared a group of baboons would aposviciously killapos the helpless cub - as heaposd witnessed many times. Thankfully he was mistaken. To his surprise, one of the males ran over to the baby, scooped it up in its arms and began scaling a marula tree, as the defenceless lion watched its enemies circling underneath. The baboon continued hopping from branch to branch as dad-of-one Kurt and other safari guests winced - worried the lone lion would fall from its grip. But eventually the monkey settled with the rival baby predator in its arms, before stroking and caring for it like a loving father. In the hit Disney movie, Rafiki is a wise old monkey, thought to be a mandrill or baboon, who looks after young Simba and often gives him guidance.  Kurt, from White River, South Africa, said: It was a strange experience. I was worried the cub would fall because it would not survive that height. The baboon was grooming the little lion cub asit was a baby baboon. The baboon moved from branch to branch grooming and carrying the cub for a long period of time.  The males do a lot of grooming but the care given [...] was the same care given by a female to one of her own young. In  years of guiding southern and east Africa, I have witnessed baboons viciously killing leopard cubs and have heard of baboons killing lion cubs. But I have never seen the care and attention given to a lion cub in this manner.  This will remain one of my most interesting sightings. While Kurt and other animal lovers watched on, they feared the baboon would bring the cub back down to its aposexcitedapos, aposplayfulapos and potentially deadly troop. The photographer had to leave to give other guests a chance to watch, but was told the primates eventually took the cub away and its fate remains unknown.

Owners have been asking friends or strangers to break into their homes to rescue or feed their pets amid fears that up to , animals have been abandoned in Wuhan. About five million people who left the city for Chinese New Year have been unable tosince the lockdown began on January  and thousands of others are in hospital with the virus.

He said up to , pets had been left alone at home in Wuhan as owners went away for Chinese New Year.

There were claims online that dogs were being rounded up and killed amid discredited concerns that they could spread the virus to humans.  Authorities in the province of Zhejiang, which had the second-highest number of infections, said dogs caught in public would be put to death.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49771379-240x180.jpg

Berra went straight into the XI less than  hours after signing on loan, partnering Jordon Forster in central defence who made his first appearance in six weeks.Conor Hazard replaced Jack Hamilton in goal while Ollie Crankshaw made his first start since joining from Wigan on loan.Missing through injury were Jordan Marshall , who is out long-term, Paul McGowanand Andrew Nelsonleaving the matchday

pressure.On  minutes, they got the breakthrough with Berra coming up with the assist. It was route one stuff as the -cap Scotland international pinged a long ball up to Hemmings. He got the better of debutant Sean McGinty before spinning and firing the ball home.Despite their strong start, Dundee were pegged back on  minutes by former favourite McAlister. Shaun Byrne gave away the free-kick -yards out giving Nicky Cadden a look at goal. His effort took a deflection off the wall and Hazard could only palm the ball out, leaving McAlister with an easy finish.Seconds later Kalvin Orsi fired just over the bar as the home side had their tails up and the same player had the ball in the net from a superb overhead kick eight minutes before the break. The linesman#s flag, though, was already up for offside.After the break, Orsi looked certain to score only for Berra to get a vital toe on the ball at the last moment. The ball, though, careered off Forster#s leg before bobbling wide of the post.On  minutes, Morton were reduced to  men after Kyle Jacobs went in heavily on Hemmings on the halfway line to earn his second yellow of the contest. Home fans weren#t happy after referee Bobby Madden played an advantage before pulling the game back to book Jacobs but the tackle certainly warranted a caution.Moments later and Dundee were inches away from making the extra man count immediately as Declan McDaid curled a good effort off the far post and Forster headed the rebound wide.Hemmings went close two minutes later only for Chris Millar to block before Christie Elliott almost marked his debut with a fine goal after replacing Crankshaw.The former Partick man cut in from his left wing position and hit a fine effort that flew just past the far post.A man light, Morton were happy to hold their shape and sit back while Dundee played the ball around the middle of the park.With eight minutes to go, though, Ton had the chance to steal the points as Orsi rose in the centre of goal but headed wide of the post.In stoppage time, Elliott thought he had grabbed a late winner on his debut but his free-kick clipped the wall and drted just wide of the post with goalie Danny Rogers stranded.Morton: Rogers, Tumilty, McGinty, Jacobs, McAlister, Orsi , Strapp, Cadden , Sutton , Colville, Baird.Subs not used: Ramsbottom, McLean, McHugh, McGuffie.Dundee: Hazard, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Berra, Byrne, Dorrans, Callachan, McDaid, Crankshaw , Hemmings.Subs not used: Hamilton, Meekings, Robertson, Anderson, Cameron.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3947a16712d8.76672501-111x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"scotland international christophe berra seals dundee switch","story":"Christophe Berra will spend the rest of the season at Dundee after the Dark Blues sealed a loan deal for the Scotland international.The former Hearts skipper was surplus to requirements at Tynecastle, alerting Dens Park boss James McPake to the possibility of adding the seasoned defender to his squad.Thirty-five-year-old Berra joins the Championship side as they struggle to find the form to mount a promotion push with a wealth of experience behind him.The central defender has  Scotland caps to his name and has played almost  matches in his career for the Jambos, Wolves and Ipswich Town."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e345523ec0307.65145736.jpg ","title":"wily old fox dick campbell is top dog for utd boss","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson thinks Arbroath gaffer Dick Campbell should be in the running for Manager of the Year.Campbell brings his Red Lichties side to Tannadice today sitting just a point outside of the Championship promotion play-off spots after winning League One last season.And Robbie reckons his exploits with the Angus men should have Campbell in the running for the PFA Manager of the Year prize, backing him to continue the job he’s done until the end of the campaign.“Dick would be up there.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10969268.jpg?type=article-full","title":"green-go-benefits-purchasing-leasing-electric-hybrid-cars","story":"Intelligent Car LeasingElectric cars offer the practicality of a normal petrol or diesel car but with greatly reduced emissions. In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The long-term economic effects of Brexit will undoubtedly be pretty dire. The Treasury forecast is that the UK will lose over % of GDP growth, which is as much as in a serious recession.But wersquove already lost % since , according to most estimates, and that hasnrsquot had much impact on Brexit opinion. Moreover, these forecasts are based on untested assumptions.Reduced immigration leads to lower growth, but it might also lead to higher wages being paid to workers already in the UK. Wage growth has been ticking up since Brexit.So we canrsquot rely on some popular revolt against Brexit, and anyway itrsquos not clear how a botched Brexit is going to make the case for Scottish independence.Westminster might just as well say that wersquove had enough of isive referendums. While the UK economy is under the stresses of transition, now is not the time for a Scottish independence referendum throwing another spanner in the works.Theresa May said exactly that in , and Boris Johnson, with his huge majority, is almost certain to say the same. Which means there will not be the ldquolegal and legitimate referendum which the First Minister says is the only one she will entertain.:Iain Macwhirter: Labour is on a loser with its unsubtle attack on nationalismShe did actually mention in her speech the possibility of a consultative referendum, and said that the time might come when Holyroodrsquos powers to hold such a referendum might he tested in court. There has been much learned discussion of this on the internet among legally-trained nationalists.However, she didnrsquot exactly bubble over with enthusiasm at the prospect. For Ms Sturgeon the only independence worth having is one recognised by Westminster, and the EU, as legitimate. That requires No. to agree a Section  Order allowing a legal and binding referendum to take place.She has a point. Unionists might boycott a consultative referendum. Local authorities would have to organise it and voters might regard it as a waste of money since the result doesnrsquot mean anything. Boris Johnson will certainly say that.So, it was another dose of sober realism from the FM on Friday. Wersquove been here before. Itrsquos not a great prospect for the legions of enthusiastic nationalists who have been led to believe that a referendum is just over the horizon. That horizon is getting more distant by the year.Some prominent nationalists believe the gamersquos a bogey. The most influential independence-supporting website, Wings over Scotland, has just thrown in the towel over Nicola Sturgeonrsquos legalistic approach. The Rev Stu says the site, which has a huge following, and raises six-figure sums each year, will notuntil Nicola Sturgeon is history.That may take a while. There is no obvious replacement for Ms Sturgeon. Shes been hugely successful in electoral terms and as this column has pointed out in the past, political parties are mainly concerned with winning and keeping seats. The SNP depends on the flow of cash and energy supplied by its MPs and MSPs. It doesnrsquot want a repeat of  when the SNP lost a third of its Westminster seats.The FM is a cautious lawyer, disinclined to lead from the front. Alex Salmond would probably be active in emulating Mandela. Organising campaigns of civil disobedience, withdrawing from Westminster, fighting in the courts, staging ldquoadvisory plebiscites. The kind of ldquoratchet\" approach advocated by The Common Weal activists.That might or might not work. But the question is irrelevant. The SNP used to regard itself as a revolutionary party not part of the establishment. But it has become the establishment in Scotland.

And that means first and foremost that ministers need to get their own house in order.Britain will also need to work with the EU ahead of the blocrsquos summit with China in September, with serious European moves to cut emissions required to encourage the worldrsquos biggest polluter to take more action.But one thing likely to set the tone of the talks will be out of the UK Governmentrsquos hands: the US presidential election.President Trump has initiated proceedings to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, with the withdrawal coming into final effect the day after the election on November  ndash less than a week before the talks begin.His re-election could strengthen the hand of other countries that have argued against strong climate action, but a newly elected Democrat president would likely want to send a clear message that the US is back in the climate-fighting game."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Rest easy - Nigel has been busy making plans for Nigel","story":"In the furrowed brow camp, according to some of the Sunday papers, was the entire Cabinet, reportedly irritated that the EU was not going to give the UK a loose, Canada-style trade deal and would instead be insisting on regulatory alignment.Nigel Farage, reviewing the papers on The Andrew Marr Show, also counts being a ldquorule taker as a red line. You could normally rely on him becoming very animated on the subject, but this was a new, post-Brexit Nigel on display.Calm, chipper, strolling on the sunny side of the street, he did not look like a man who had just lost his job and was, with Brexit now done, surplus to requirements.That was certainly not how Mr Farage saw it. When the Brexit Partyrsquos MEPs left Brussels last week they were facing uncertain futures. Some would be heading straight for their local JobCentre Plus office. Not so Mr Farage.

Now that the UK was out, did the Brexit Party still exist, Marr wondered.Oh yes, said Mr Farage. He had been fooled before into thinking his services were no longer needed.ldquoIn  after the referendum I was so thrilled that wersquod won, I had been doing it for so many years, I actually believed Theresa May when she said Brexit means Brexit, very stupidly of me. I think I gave the impression that I rather walked away. Irsquom not going to walk away this time. The Brexit Party will still be there. It will be more an insurance policy in case things go wrong.A new think tank is to be set up, called Brexit Watch, and in the next  months the party would ldquopraise the Government to the high heavens when they are getting it right but ring the alarm bellthey are not.Also in the Farage diary is a trip to the US. In the giddy days after the EU referendum there was talk of Mr Farage becoming the British ambassador to the US. President Trump loved the idea, tweeting that he would do ldquoa great job. It did not happen then and it is not going to happen now. What he is going to do in the US was unclear, with Marr saying only that the former City trader would be ldquositting alongside Mr Trump, which conjured up visions of a ventriloquist act.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, did his usual trick of giving an alfresco interview to Ridge on Sunday en route to Marr. He backed his boss on not aligning with EU rules, or as he put it: ldquoLegislative alignment ndash it just ainrsquot happening. Sounds like a slogan for the side of a bus.: Leader refuses to back MP in raceMr Raab had positioned himself in the grumpy camp earlier by telling UK representatives not to be pally with their former EU chumsthey met at international talks. They should ldquosit separately, he said.Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, called this ldquopetty and said it sounded like the sort of thing that happened at school. Otherwise, Mr Varadkar was strangely upbeat for a man whose party is in the middle of an election and behind in the polls.First prize for being a sunbeam went not to Mr Farage or Mr Varadkar but to Marrrsquos main guest, Donald Tusk.The now former president of the European Council can be relied upon to say something newsworthy. It was Mr Tusk, you will recall, who said there would be a ldquospecial place in hell for those who promoted Brexit but had no idea how to do it safely.At the end of last week the SNP asked the EU to ldquoleave a light on for an independent Scotland to . Mr Tusk duly appointed himself lamplighter in chief, and an honorary Scot to boot. ldquoIrsquom very Scottish now, he said, gesturing to his heart. ldquoEspecially after Brexit.: PM ready to accept checks at borderThe Foreign Secretary took a frosty view of this warm welcome, calling it ldquofrankly rather un-European and rather irresponsible given the secessionist separatist tendencies in Spain, France and Italy.A Conservative minister scolding the former president of the European Council for being un-European.

Youve worked your way up to a wealthy, privileged place where your voice, which people actually want to listen to, is amplied to millions of folk at once.Problems arise when it turns out that you are, in fact, a rank hypocrite.Take, for one example, Prince William, who warned of the \"catastrophic effect\" of overpopulation on the planet... while his we was expecting their third child. Perhaps keep your mouth zipped on that topicyoure not keeping your trousers zipped.His Royal Highness was back on it at the Baftas on Sunday night, this time giving a speech about how the industry must try harder in terms of racial ersity.Im not sure I remember him putting his name to his brothers statement about the racist treatment of his own sister-in-law or prioritising erse representation in his household staff. London is one of the most multi-cultural cities on earth - not hard to find employees from a iety of backgrounds, one would imagine.Where Willian, and so many celebrities, lets himself down is to make a point about an issue without addressing how he is complicit in the problem and should be addressing it. Otherwise, you look sanctimonious and a bit silly.Stepping in to show him how it should be done was Joaquin Phoenix, making an acceptance speech for Best Actor against a backdrop of an all-white acting nominees shortlist.There had been talk, when the shortlist was announced last month, of a boycott but, rather, everyone whos anyone turned out on the night.Phoenix, addressing the whiteness of the awards ceremony, made his interest in the issue credible. \"Irsquom ashamed to say that Irsquom part of the problem,\" he said, \"Because Irsquove not ensured that the sets Irsquove worked on are inclusive.\"He added: \"We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. It is the obligation of the people who have created and benefit from the system of oppression to be the ones to dismantle it.\"So thatrsquos on us.\"The \"us\" was followed with a slightly too long pause. It makes people uncomfortable to hear they might be complicit in an injustice they would be quick to condemn. Action, though, is the real test of mettle and lets see what action Phoenix now takes to address this issue.The actor Laurence Fox would, as a surprise to everyone following his appallingly crass Question Time appearance, seem to be role modelling decent behaviour in the wake of racism.Fox took it upon himself to argue with an academic in the BBC audience about racism. When his own white privilege was called out he labelled this racist and he referred to discussions of race in modern Britain as \"boring\". What a luxury, to be able to be bored about a subject that profoundly effects the lives of your neighbours, eh He went on to make some bizarre remarks about  trying too hard to be ethnically erse and ending up historically inaccurate. The only one who was inaccurate, in the end, was Laurence Fox, but he bullishly kept on.Until last week when he was pictured with the writer and critic Bonnie Greer, who Fox seems to have contacted after hearing her criticise him on a radio show.Greer was lambasted for the meeting and told that she shouldnt have accommodated him. It seems that speaking directly to your critics, face to face and not online, in an attempt to learn and understand is a step a great many people could learn from.While Foxs views were repulsive, his most recent actions are right. Now he has had Greers generous counsel, Im sure hes far less bored.Learning opportunities, happily, abound. The new Speaker of the House of Commons has laid down a role model gauntlet we must hope other men will pick up.When asked as to what he thinks about breastfeeding in the House, Lindsay Hoyle said he would allow it. A -year ban, imposed by Baroness Boothroyd, has surely hampered new mothers from taking their place, should they want to, on the green benches.The decision is right, but Sir Lindsays rationale is righter still. \"I think it would be wrong for me as a male to dictate on that policy,\" he said. Absolutely.Taking responsibility, self-reflection and centring the people effected by policy - some good news for once. Phoenix, Sir Lindsay and Fox show how it should be done.

But in reality, for the vast majority of readers going about their work and le, very little will change as a result of leaving the EU.The SNP needs to understand this, see the parallels to independence, and ride the wave. Its ability to do so could well be the dference between success and failure both in next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament election, and in the second independence referendum which it hopes will follow.I have never been of the opinion that the SNPrsquos strategic approach to Brexit has been entirely smart. Of course it is sensible of it to position itself as the party of Remain in a country which voted  per cent to stay. And of course it made the right judgment to suppose that those SNP voters who also voted to leave the EU will fall back into line, with an independent Scotland being their bigger prize.But the SNP allowed itself to be sucked into the hysteria of Brexitrsquos impact, and it is one aspect of its approach which will have to changeit is to be successful in a future independence referendum. Because, self-evidently, the walls have not fallen in since Friday night, as many predicted, just as the walls did not fall in the day after the Brexit vote, as many predicted, just as the walls will not fall in on January  after the end of the transition period, as many predict.This matters to the SNP because its politicians now need to put a nation at ease by selling the message that the walls will not fall inthey vote for independence. In order to achieve that it needs to dial down the hysterical messaging on Brexit.There are other big-ticket SNP messages which will need to changethe party is to fulfil its raison drsquoetre. Perhaps the biggest of all is its policy on membership of the very institution under discussion, the EU.Whatever the UK Governmentrsquos negotiations with Brussels over the next  months bring, it is highly unlikely that they will produce any kind of customs union. This gives the SNP a migraine, because its policy of negotiating membership of the EU for a post-independent Scotland by definition means entering into the EUrsquos Customs Union.And, as we have seen rehearsed atover the last four years in relation to the border on the island of Ireland, Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU would create the need for some sort of check on goods travelling between Scotland and England.The nature of the check, and the hardness of the border, will quite rightly be the subject of debate, but the core problem will not go away, and it is utterly toxic for a nationalist campaign hoping to win over people who are instinctive, often emotional Unionists.It is the sort of issue which turns elections, and referenda. And unlike in Ireland, we canrsquot hide the problem at the bottom of the sea.So what can the SNP do to avoid it  Well, much as those inside the SNP hate to talk about it, even privately, the political reality of its position is that all roads lead to EFTA.The European Free Trade Association has four memberswhich are not members of the EU or its customs union, but are in the single market by virtue of their inclusion in the European Economic Area.It has been made perfectly clear, and is perfectly logical, that an independent Scotland would be welcomed into the group, and there is very little about this route that doesnrsquot make sense for the SNP.Externally, to a nation which showed little unrequited love for the EU before the Brexit referendum ushered in a wave of marches and flag-buying, and which will by then have realised that le outside the EU is not akin to a scene from  Days Later, this is a fairly easy sell. Scotland would be in the free trade area, and would enjoy freedom of movement. But it would not economically self-harm through a customs barrier with its biggest trading partner ndash England ndash and it would not politically self-harm by risking a physical border on Britain.It is, to quote several politicians in the last decade, the best of both worlds.The SNPrsquos largest problem will be the internal sell to a politician and activist base which has become emotionally committed to the EU. Logic doesnrsquot always work in these situations, and they would not be the first set of politicians to place themselves in political harm because they cannot see the wood for the trees.Inevitably, the SNPrsquos leadership would have to present EFTA as a stepping stone to full EU membership. It would say that Scotland would ldquopark in EFTA until free trade and movement were secured both to the UK and to the EU.But, with that highly unlikely to be possible, Scotland would park in EFTA and then throw the car keys in the North Sea. Indeed, it seems perfectly likely to me that Scotland, like Norway, will benefit sufficiently from EFTA membership that the public clamour to rejoin the EU will evaporate, as it has in Norway, which now sees pro-EU polling in the teens.The SNP still has a lot of work to do to persuade the  per cent-or-so persuadables that independence is a good idea. Flag-waving leftism wonrsquot do that. They need to see a competent operation taking sensible decisions. One of those will be a sensible decision on the future relationship with Europe.As the dust settles, it will become politically impossible for the SNP to sell the consequences of EU membership to these people. And so, as we will see in the years to come, it matters not how many lights Donald Tusk leaves on for Scotland.We are not going back in.

He remains in the Oval Office because almost every Republican senator preferred being in power to upholding the democratic principles upon which the US was founded. By Wednesday Mr Trump will have defied justice. He will then be free to continue his campaign of grievance and resentment safe in the knowledge that there is no genuine check on his executive overreach.It goes on to say this week Mr Trump will deliver the State of the Union address from the House chamber where he was impeached in December. He could use the presidency as a bully pulpit to bring out the best in civic le. But he will not. The president wants voters less interested in integrity and empathy. Mr Trump will speak of a \"great American comeback.\" Ever the malignant narcissist, the reference will surely and unmistakably be to himself rather than the country.The TimesIts editorial says to remove Mr Trump from office his accusers needed to show him guilty of \"high crime and misdemeanor,\" which is a lofty bar.In order to make their case, to the American people as much as to the Senate itself, Mr Trumps accusers sought to subpoena further documents and witnesses, perhaps subjecting the latter to televised hearings. \"We must hear from those who were in the room where it happened,\" was how the House impeachment manager Sylvia Garcia put it on Friday, with the last phrase referencing the title of a new book by Mr Tumps former national security adviser, John Bolton. Leaked extracts from Mr Boltons book appear to support allegations against the president, but the Republican-dominated Senate voted against calling new witnesses. As a result they are almost certain to vote for Mr Trumps acquittal this week.The Within days of leaving amid expressions of regret from around Europe, the gloves have come off as Brussels seeks to make clear that the UKs departure has consequences.The first is expected to be a repudiation by the EU of any move towards a Canada-style trade deal and an insistence that single market rules and regulations are followed after the transition period.No  is accusing Brussels of unilaterally changing the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. If Brussels is reneging on its side of the deal then the UK should withhold the money promised as an integral part of the orce until they abide by it.The ScotsmanIts editorial focusses on Brexit in the aftermath of Fridays departure from the EU at pm. It says nothing is over, in fact the uncertainty is only just beginning and the true impact of Brexit has merely been postponed until the end of the year.Johnson will kick off the truly terrying prospect of trying to complete a complicated trade deal with the EU in less than a year today with a typically bullish speech.He will tell the EU that he is prepared to accept border checks in a no-deal scenario, no alignment, no jurisdiction of the European courts and no concessions to any Brussels demands when talks start in March.The Prime Minister is still playing his greatest hits to his hardline Brexiteer audience.And why not, you may, as it has served him so well and indeed ed his party to government with a thumping majority in the Commons. But while this tactic will continue to be lapped up by the faithful, attention must now turn to securing the best possible future relationship with our European neighbours and preparing for an exit in  which will cause the least damage to our economy.Farage and co have their blue passports, we do not need to pretend any more that severing all ties is in either the UK or the EUs interest."},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk-stakes-claim-birthplace-irn-bru-accusing-glasgow-hijacking-drink","story":"Initially named lsquoIrn Brew,rsquo Scotlandrsquos other national drink was launched in  in a joint launch by AG Barr  Co - from Glasgow -and Robert Barr - in Falkirk.The drink was originally produced in Falkirk, near Stirling, with a colourful image daubed on the gable wall of the Cockburn Street building - which is now covered up by a billboard.Two years later Barrrsquos Iron Brew was launched, with the spelling going on to become lsquoIrn Brursquo in .:Irn-Bru maker AG Barr shares fizz on strong profit forecastIn , both sides of the family business were merged into one, A.G Barr.Campaigners hoping to put Falkirk on the tourist map have called for a mural to be erected in the town - believing the drink has been wrongly adopted by Glasgow.Convener of heritage body The Society of John De Graeme, David Reid, believes tourists would flock to the former industrial town - much as they do for whisky tourism in other parts of Scotland.Mr Reid said: ldquoThe mural used to be there, on the side of the original factory where Irn Bru was created.ldquoIt was where it originally started. Barr was originally a cork maker, he created corks for bottles, then he moved into aerated water.ldquoFalkirk used to be an industrial town, but the slogan lsquoMade from girdersrsquo didnrsquot originate until the s as an ad slogan.ldquoThere are pictures where you can see the Barrs cart pulled by a horse.ldquoIt was one of the biggest horses in the world.ldquoPeople believe that Glasgow invented Irn Bru but it started in Falkirk.ldquoThere was a family member who started some of it in Glasgow.

If an independent Scotland were in the EU, then Scotlandrsquos border with the rest of the UK would be an external border of the European Union.She said thatBoris Johnson succeeding in getting a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU, ldquothe Anglo-Scottish border would be both a regulatory and a customs border.ldquoThere will be the Scotland-England land border that may require regulatory and customs checks. Then there would be a dferent sea and air border between Scotland and Northern Ireland - softer than the one with England and Wales perhaps - since Northern Ireland would be de facto in the EUrsquos customs union and in its single market for goods.ldquoThere will also be considerable challenges around services.ldquoIf a UK-EU free trade deal can be negotiated by the end of , it is not expected to include services. The shape of any future deals on services, transport and ious security issues may take considerably longer. So, again, there would potentially be barriers between the rest of the UK and Scotland in the services sector as a result.She saidScotland chose not to join the EU, as SNP MSP Alex Neil has suggested, but went into the looser European Economic Area like Norway, it would cause other problems.ldquoIt would be in the EUrsquos single market but not in its customs union. It would therefore be free to strike its own trade deal with the rest of the UK.ldquoThe upsides would mean less, but potentially still substantial, friction in Scotland-rUK trade. ldquoThe downsides are clear ndash there would then be borders and barriers in both directions: regulatory borders with the rest of the UKand customs borders, as Norway faces, with the EU. Any serious discussion would need in-depth economic analysis of the static and dynamic benefits of these dferent options.She concluded: ldquoIf, in the end, an independent Scotland negotiated its way back into the EU, it would find itself part, with the other EU member states, of whatever UK-EU trade and security relationship had already been negotiated. Itrsquos clear that, compared to the debate in , Brexit radically changes, in many ways, the implications of independence in the EU.However Dr Hughes also said there had been a political sht in Scotlandrsquos favour because of Brexit, with ldquomore openness to the possibility that Scotland could become independent and apply to re-join the EU.She said: ldquoCertainly, member states with concerns around secession ndash including, but not only, Spain ndash would want to be reassured that any independence referendum was constitutionally and legally valid.ldquoBut, with the UK no longer a member state, and with the ill-will generated by the whole Brexit process, Scotland as a proEuropean, remain-voting country is now seen by EU member statesin a much more positive light.The paper is part of a new report, Brexit and the Union, produced by Edinburgh Universityrsquos Centre on Constitutional Change.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: ldquoThis confirms there is a high risk of a hard border with EnglandScotland leaves the UK.ldquoWith  per cent of our exports going to the rest of the UK, putting up barriers would jeopardise our economy and jobs, particularly under the SNPrsquos plan to scrap the pound.ldquoNicola Sturgeonrsquos inward-looking and negative vision for Scotlandrsquos future would also lead to a barrier between friends, families and neighbours for the first time in centuries.ldquoThe positive future for Scotland based on solidarity and economic growth is to remain in the UK.Meanwhile, it has emerged that a light show projected on the European Commission building in Brussels about Scotland and Europe on Brexit night was paid for by the SNP, not put on by the Commission.The First Minister had tweeted a picture of the \"Scotland

She pledged to “live up to our responsibility” to future generations and announced that the Scottish Government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by , five years ahead of the UK as a whole.As bold and progressive as these targets are, it will require leadership at all levels of government to realise them. Crucially, it will require Scotland’s  local authorities to help address climate change.Councils are the sphere of government closest to our communities. Our unique reach and vast remit of policy areas mean that we have a huge impact across the country. From the businesses that councils choose to support to the planning applications that are approved from the types of houses and public buildings we build to our investment in sustainable transport, roads and paths, local action is critical to our success.: Douglas Millican: Climate change water strategy must stand the test of time: ‘Catastrophic’ climate change is accelerating faster than predictedThis is an internationally recognised conclusion. The Paris climate accord, where  countries agreed to determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that they undertake to mitigate global warming, was unreserved in recommending that councils are a core part of the fight against climate change. “The Conference of the Parties recognises the need to strengthen knowledge, technologies, practices and efforts of local communities and indigenous peoples related to addressing and responding to climate change,” it said.Disproportionate share of cutsThis is a call to arms for every local politician in the world, that the fight against climate change will be aided locally, with local government at its heart.This will not be done on the cheap, however. A fight such as this requires the means to be able to do so. Investment in our critical leadership role is required to focus on the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. One that breaks down the barriers our citizens face and creates a new set of opportunities for our workforce.On Thursday, the Government will announce its budget for the coming year. It will be important that it recognises the “climate emergency”. There is a need for a budget to help combat the global emergency – a fight that will not be won when council core budgets are under threat.Over a number of years, local government budgets have decreased signicantly. Between - overall funding has gone down in real terms by seven per cent. In comparison the Scottish Government has had its funding reduced by only two per cent. We are the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s communities, yet we are being passed a disproportionate share of cuts compared to our national counterparts.More funds from UKThe services that are at risk when our core budgets are under threat are exactly the kind that are essential in combating climate change.If we are to encourage our citizens to stop using their vehicles to help reduce emissions, then why would we cut a budget that funds passenger and community transport If we want our homes, public buildings and businesses to use less energy, then why would we cut a budget that provides energy efficiency advice and grants Andwe want to provide our communities with facilities to recycle, then why would we cut a budget for waste services The Scottish Government has a chance to address climate change at every level. We need a fair funding commitment for local government that looks across the whole system. All the signs are that Scotland will see a cash increase from the UK Government, this must be passed on to local government.Strong local leadership will be requiredwe are to truly meet these ambitious  targets. The Scottish Government has a chance to invest in councils so we can develop world-class digital infrastructure, enable the transformation of services and reduce the need for travel so we can enable investment in cleaner, greener public transport and buildings so we can support businesses across all sectors to achieve zero carbon emissions and so we can provide and maintain vibrant green spaces across the country.We cannot afford to look at the local government settlement narrowly. It must be viewed in its entirety to reflect the whole-system approach that is required to tackle and address the biggest challenges facing Scotland and threatening the sustainability of our communities, the communities that councils look after and invest in every day, of every week, of every year.Councillor Steven Heddle is environment and economy spokesperson for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why i lament transformation of stockbridge into scene from richard curtis movie aidan smith","story":"Aidan Smith lived in Stockbridge, recently ranked as the least deprived area in Scotland, for five decades and remembers it fondly as a more #edgy# neighbourhood.At the Sunday market, the pheasant-burgers were flying off the shelves. No one was being stung by the nettle moisturiser’s asking price and hot cakes – warmed-up croissants with whisky-laced marmalade, organic of course – were selling like the proverbial.The beautul people were out in force, snuggle-buggled up against the cold as they moved round the stalls – at least when their £ Canada Goose jackets and voluminous scarves weren’t causing a blockage in the lanes. It looked like a scene from a Richard Curtis movie and no one happening across it could have been surprised that Edinburgh’s Stockbridge had just been named the least deprived community in Scotland.Meanwhile, I was trying to remember what the place was like when it was plain and humble Stockaree. On the site of the market there used to be tenements which were pulled down in the s amid high excitement. Kids walking to school for more arithmetic, semolina and the belt had never seen a wrecking-ball do its thing before.: ‘Stockbridge isn’t posh’ - businesses and residents respond to report naming Edinburgh neighbourhood Scotland’s ‘least deprived’ area: Hundreds queue outside Stockbridge Shelter store for January charity saleAcross the street was a toy shop which only seemed to sell plastic and tin weaponry. We were all desperate to own a Johnny Seven – “Seven guns in one … let’s count ’em!” went the ad – but my pocket money would only stretch to a flame-thrower for Action Man. This did nothing, of course, least of all shoot fire. Essentially, as my father would teasingly point out, Action Man was dressing-up dollies for boys. But I never got the accessory home as I was jumped by the Cumbie Street gang and had it nicked.Enviouos, acquisitive and smugHalf a century ago, Stockbridge probably wouldn’t have figured quite so high on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationwhich puts it top of the pops while Greenock languishes in bottom place. Fty-odd years ago, viewed from the perspective of a fur-trimmed Canada Goose hood, you would have called Stockbridge “edgy”. No one used such terminology then, of course. Wherever was home you simply got on as best you could with living, learning which streets to avoid. Now, though, we’re obsessed with league tables and where we figure in them. We crave surveys which tell us how much better we’re doing than some poor schmucks. We get to enjoy European football they suffer relegation.SIMD is supposed to highlight which communities need more help to alleviate poverty and you really hope it fulfills this . But there are critics who argue it’s flawed, that in high-density areas well-off families can be ranked as deprived, enabling them to play the system.Should it be published, though  Or rather, why is it published in full  We should know which areas are at the wrong end and they shouldn’t feel any embarrassment about this. But what’s to be gained from listing the least deprived  If a newspaper turns round the findings and calls Stockbridge the most affluent – not The Scotsman, but a rival title did this – then SIMD starts to read like one of those frivolous lestyle studies or deeply unscientic reports into property trends. Result  More envy, more acquisitiveness, more smugness.I don’t live in Stockbridge anymore. The family suddenly got bigger and we couldn’t afford the larger house we needed. Did I, for the best part of five decades, enjoy the best of it  I’m not going to claim that for fear of being seen as smug but it was certainly dferent.How to pronounce StockbridgeThere wasn’t a branch of Farrow  Ball offering the on-trend, must-have paint colour called Economy Mince, but we had a flea-pit cinema with lax usherettes so we could hide under the seats and watch Raquel Welch in One Million Years BC, fighting T-Rex in a fur bikini, many times over.Where once there was artisan housing along the Water of Leith – trim dwellings built for the working-class by philanthropists – now there are many opportunities to buy artisan bread and coffee from men in beards who don’t seem to be able to afford socks so that’s a link with the past, I suppose.For those of us growing up in EH – when everyone pronounced Stockbridge with the emphasis on the first syllable rather than the second which is the incomers’ way – a rite-of-passage was Madam Doubtfire’s second-hand clothes emporium. Were you brave enough to venture into the basement blackness, down among the mangy cats  Could you ask for something the stone-faced proprietress patently didn’t stock, like a Johnny Seven gun or Cremola Foam  Then could you run away before she hurled her clay pipe at you She wasn’t Stockbridge’s only ‘madam’. For -odd years, Dora Noyce was in the rather dferent business of running a brothel in Danube Street which was hugely popular with sailors dropping anchor at Leith. Some time after she died, when one of my four Stockbridge addresses was just round the corner, I would be stopped by panting men in full naval unorm looking for an Edinburgh attraction every bit as renowned on the high seas as the Tattoo. Gradually Danube Street pulled up its knickers and became respectable. Cumbie Street reverted back to Cumberland Street and the toerags stopped dropping penny bangers in the metal dustbins of New Town residents further up the hill. Gentrication has smoothed away much of Stockbridge’s supposed edginess and there are estate agents on every corner. A couple of old-skool pubs hang on, as does the hardware shop where the welcome is just as challenging as Madam Doubtfire. But even the river is respectable now, no longer capable since flood prevention measures of flattening the Antony Gormley statue near to the site of the market.I do miss Stockbridge, but only when it was affluent in local colour, a shade you cannot buy in Farrow  Ball.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp appoint murray foote former daily record editor and creator of the vow as new media chief","story":"Mr Foote, who was editor of the tabloid paper for four years, has been credited with helping sway public opinion during the  independence referendum after the front page pledge from the then Prime Minster, which promised more powers for HolyroodScots voted \"No\". - Latest poll shows support for Scottish independence at %But he will now be the SNPs head of communications and research in the Scottish Parliament, replacing Fergus Mutch, who was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the December General Election in West Aberdeenshire.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia. During treatment for the condition, she developed the rare le threatening condition necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh eating disease, resulting in surgeons removing large parts of the soft tissue in her face.Despite the trauma, Janine survived but her story made local headlines back in February  when she approached the North Belfast News for help after suffering abuse on the street and online because of the way she looks.In a heartbreaking interview, she revealed that she’d had to start wearing earphones when she left the house to block out the abuse and insults she was receiving from young people. But the North Belfast community rallied round and she was inundated with cards and gts, restoring her faith in human nature.In the programme, Janine talks about her le, the surgical treatments she has received and the dficulties she has faced her entire adult le, including the cruel taunts she receives because of how she looks.As Janine and her partner Matthew plan their wedding, they are met with generosity from local businesses who want to help. But as the day approaches Janine has one wish – to get her smile back.She is hoping doctors may be able to reverse some of the effects of her facial scarring through reconstructive surgery and hopefully restore her smile for her wedding photographs.True North: Saving Face is made by Triplevision Productions for BBC Northern Ireland.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"petition to save belfast zoo signed by almost","story":"Belfast Zoo. Picture: Google Maps  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBelfast Zoo. Picture: Google Maps Eimear McGovernFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA petition to save Belfast Zoo has gathered almost , signatures since it was started five days ago. The petition directed at Belfast City Council comes after a Sinn Fein motion called for the transformation of the facility into a world class visitor attraction by . The number of people signing the petition has been growing steadily since the petition was started, with many sharing their reasons as to why the facility should remain.Meanwhile, an opposing petition calling for the zoo to be closed has gathered  signatures on an animal rights protection . Organisers said their fundamental belief is that there is no need for any animal to remain in captivity and that they belong in the wild. Those supporting the petition to keep the Cave Hill site open called for investment while others advocated for the zoo#s conservation efforts, saying it does a lot to save endangered species.Sinn Fein#s motion put forward last week said some animals should be ed to their natural habitats in a carefuly crafted phased approach. This was rubbished by people who signed the petition, with one saying to re-introduce these lovely animals to the wild is silly, they will not survive.Another said: The zoo is vital for conservation efforts across the globe, provides valuable work placements for students looking to go into the conservation field and provides excellent learning opportunities to communities and young people. Money needs to be put into the zoo by the council or sold onto someone who will put the money in to make it more accessible , they wrote on the Change.org petition. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Belfast Zoo  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThis would be a great opportunity to work with Queen#s university academics and students to design stimulating enclosures both for the public and animals.Please don#t turn Belfast zoo into a tacky tourist attraction, they pleaded.  At Monday#s council meeting, Castle Councillor Conor Maskey hit out at what he described as silly reactions from other parties and the media#s approach to the recent public debate.As well as ing animals to their natural habitats and transforming the zoo into a visitor attraction, a conservation programme for indigenous animals and a commitment to retaining staff was also put forward in the motion. Councillor Maskey referred to other parties portraying the motion as about locking up the zoo and throwing away the key.He said the approach was far, far, far, from it.He told the chamber: This was never about closing the zoo, it was about properly investing in the site to ensure we are in keeping with a modern and ethical approach to the city and the animals, and doesn#t burden the rate payer.He added, however, in the light of the debate the party would be talking to the council about amending the motion before it is referred to the Strategic Policy and Resources Committee later this month.DUP Councillor George Dorrian confirmed his party#s opposition to the motion after meeting with trade union officials.He said the party wishes to bring about a more sustainable model but that they do not wish to close the zoo. Belfast Zoo said it would not be making any comment.

It even happens on the phone when I answer it #Frances Olive#.I also don#t have any public social media presence because I#ve been forced off it by bullies.For the -year-old former statistician, who has lived in south Belfast for two and a half years, it#s also a lonely road.I#m the oldest of seven children and only two of my siblings are totally accepting and embracing of my identity, said Frances, who has had two surgeries under the NHS and has met the criteria for being legally female.Wearing fashionable glasses with green rims and dressed in a baby pink leather jacket and a long multi-coloured pink and black dress for our interview, stylish Frances is far removed from her previous incarnation.But she said she has always known who I am from my absolute earliest memory, adding that for a long time in my teens I thought I was schizophrenic - or mad, but I didn#t tell anyone.I remember going through puberty and not being physically attracted to boys or girls Indeed, as a young boy, Frances even considered becoming a priest.I remember going through puberty and not being physically attracted to boys or girls so I thought I#d been given a gt from God, she said.So I considered the priesthood and I spent time going to two dferent seminaries in Co Cavan and Co Dublin for quite a while from when I was aged  to . I thought God wanted me for the priesthood and was making it easy for me to cope with a le of celibacy.But after praying for a sign around the age of  he didn#t get one and went home from seminary confused and uninterested in relationships with girls other than as friends.Frank was  when he got married to a girl he went to primary school with and had known all his le. She was also his best friend for decades.The couple, now orced, had two children - son Tim, the -year-old pastor of Omagh Community Church who continues to stand by the person he still calls #daddy# and a daughter with whom she has no current contact. Although they are now estranged, Frances, who#s now a policy advisor for FOCUS: The Identity Trust, said his ex was the first person who knew of his personal struggles.My ex-we knew for a long number of years but I don#t think she recognised the full import of it, Frances said. She misinterpreted the cross-dressing. Suffice to say we both recognised that it was an issue. We did attempt to live with it for approximately  years before I couldn#t survive any longer.When my ex-we discovered my identity we tried to continue on as things were before with the elephant in the room.I embraced it all and tried to be the best possible father, husband, brother and manager. I did the absolute best I could.In  Frances and his ex-we went together to get help from the NHS. That journey ended with an operation that marked the start of the transition. During years peppered with bouts of depression, anxiety, unemployment and social phobia, Frances revealed that she had also attempted suicide three times and had been considering it again before going to her GP in great distress aiming to complete suicide but not wanting to put that burden on my family.Frances was finally officially referred to the regional gender identity service by a consultant psychiatrist in  but relations with his we, whom he no longer sees, broke down in  and they parted ways.My ex always made it very clear that it was totally unacceptable to her that I would cross-dress, that I would express my true identity in public and it was coming to an absolute crisis, she said. The amount of pain that we were both undergoing ... it became impossible for me to bear it any longer and I was literally at the stage of choosing whether to be or not to be.It pains me that my decision to be me has had a fallout on those who I love the mostFrances is extremely conscious of the hurt and turmoil she has caused to her nearest and dearest, who may never come to understand her motivations.It pains me that my decision to be me has had a fallout on those who I love the most in the world, those people I continue to love, she said. The feeling of isolation is at times almost unbearable.But that said, she#s convinced it#s better being Frances than denying her true self.I am immeasurably more comfortable as me, she said. This whole journey has been about resolving my inner conflict and I have done that. I#m totally comfortable in my own identity and I don#t have to fight that any more.Yet there remains the guilt of bringing the challenge of her identity to her son and family.A lot of things happen to transgender iniduals like me and they#re largely down to societal attitudes but they affect the people around me, she admitted. There is transphobia all around me. My ex-we and my family would have experienced that sort of societal transphobia and I feel guilty becauseI wasn#t transgender none of this would be happening. Timothy has been able to transcend all that because he knows the true me.For Frances, though, this rocky road leads to her future path of choice. I always thought I had some sort of a calling, she said. Now I#m convinced my vocation is to shed some light for society for those transgender people yet to be born.I#m still here and the purpose of my being is to help change society#s attitude to people like me and to make people realise we#re not mad and we don#t have two heads.God created us the same way He created everyone .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTim and Frances Shiels togetherKevin Scott FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTim and Frances Shiels togetherTim#s Story: #I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it... we#ve agreed to disagree#Pastor Tim Shiels thought he#d already dealt with everything this world could throw at him.The -year-old had been a homeless drug addict, spent five stints in rehab and tried to take his own le before eventually getting clean and turning his le around.But the Omagh man, who is no stranger to battling for survival, was destined to face yet another bump in the long and tortuous road after his father told him he#d always felt like a woman trapped in a man#s body.I honestly thought I had seen it all, he said. It was around the beginning of . The exact date is a mystery to all of us at this stage - we#ve all been through so much already.But what do you do when your daddy sits down at your kitchen table and essentially tells you that he wants to become your mammy He added: My understanding or ignorance of gender dysphoria was limited to what I#d seen on Coronation Street [with Hayley Cropper, a male-to-female transgender character].Sitting in the lobby of a hotel, with his orced dad who now identies as a female, Frances, the father-of-four and pastor of Omagh Community Church speaks candidly about the shocking revelation from almost eight years ago.I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it, nor do I agree with it. Ultimately, we#ve agreed to disagreeBut Tim, who still calls his father #daddy#, also confided that while he accepts that Frances believes he was always a woman, he refuses to accept his father#s assessment that it#s a medical, rather than psychological, condition.That#s where the tension exists between him and me, he said. I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it, nor do I agree with it. Ultimately, we#ve agreed to disagree.Describing his conflicted feelings following the admission made by his father - who used to be called John Francis, better known as #Frank# - Tim said he was angry and wanted to poke his eyes out.It was a wave of emotion, going from shock into a processing of #What do you mean  That#s nuts. Daddy are you okay #, he recalled.As Frances was sharing this story I remember pausing and asking myself, #What do I do  I#m a pastor, I love God#. So I asked Jesus, #What would you do #That was the default setting for everything  that would follow, and I just felt my spirit telling me #You#ve just got to hold his hand# even though I wanted to run.Tim cannot, however, rememberhe did physically take his father#s hand.Neither one of us can remember the exact moment, he said. I#d like to think I held his hand, but I knew the message was that I had to maintain the relationship and journey with this. It would, however, have been easier to run.That made Jennie very angry. She was counting the cost and the impact of this on the kids.After sharing the news with we Jennie , a midwe, she requested a lead-in time where their children - Sian and Oisin , Aoeand Cadhla- could continue to see Grandad Frank.Frances wasn#t up for that - as far as she was concerned the decision had been made and we had to get up to speed with it, Tim said.That made Jennie very angry. She was counting the cost and the impact of this on the kids.We felt we were being told that this is the beat of the drum, and you#re either in or out.I felt that I#d already made the decision , but everybody  then had to make their own.Tim said that when they told the children they were met with blank faces. He then told them he wasn#t going to force them to be in any relationship they didn#t want to be in.Although Jennie has yet to meet Frances due to all the complexities of the situation, Tim told how the older three children initially decided that they wanted to hang out.We went to a cafe and it was very dficult, he recalled.Frances was described as a man and being greeted as #Sir#... and in their heads everybody was looking at them.So you#ve got an eight-year-old and two  year olds looking at someone who#s supposed to be their granddad but presenting themselves as a female.In the end they all felt it was easier to not engage with the emotion and the abnormality, so now there#s no contactThe reality is their granddad was there, looking like a woman. It didn#t make sense to them, they felt so uncomfortable with and decided it was too much for them.In the end they all felt it was easier to not engage with the emotion and the abnormality, so now there#s no contact.Explaining gender dysphoria to them wasn#t enough to make them understand their granddad#s new persona, as Tim added: I#m  and I still can#t make sense of it.He added: Our youngest journeyed the longest but the turning point for Cadhla was two summers ago when we were walking up the quay on the River Foyle and she found it incredibly dficult and very uncomfortable to have everyone looking at us.Recalling the words the consultant used to describe how his father had been feeling pre-transition - it#s like a cooker standing in the mirror and seeing a fridge - Tim said he accepts the analogy and hopes it will help people understand the complexity of this issue.We#ve got to accept there are people in our community who are suffering like that on a daily basis, he added.In his role as a Church leader, Tim said none of his congregation have rebuked him for his dad#s decision. On the contrary his incredible Church family have been very supportive.As Frances and I have journeyed together, I#m in a more authoritative position to speak into this and I#ve become more public and I#m travelling across the UK and Ireland to speak to churches, he said.More often than not the reality of the Church is that we look at people as problems to be fixed but regardless of how Frances is today, my daddy is not a problem to be fixed.

The South Derry MLA said: The British governments disastrous Brexit policy has caused huge concern among farmers and agricultural producers. On Monday, I was glad to see that the assembly passed an LCM which ensures our support for Westminsters commitment regarding  payments. Confirmation of funding for this year will bring some relief to farmers, but this is unfortunately short term. The Single Farm Payment from the EU represents  per cent of farm incomes and is crucial to the livelihoods of farmers and to the rural economy. In  , the total value of payments awarded to Mid Ulster amounted to pound,,. The idea that this amount of revenue could be removed from the local economy post EU exit is a scary thought.There is huge uncertainty about funding post  and farmers have been kept totally in the dark about their futures, and Mr Poots comments regarding his intention to remove the flat rate system which brought all farmers, whether based in the mountains or on lowlands, to an equal level, is a further worry. Hill farmers are already at a disadvantage, and the flat rate system set about to create a level playing field. On top of this, Mr Poots has indicated that he plans toto a productivity based payment which would further disadvantage hill farmers. It is Sinn Feacuteins position that this would be unfair, and our representatives on the DAERA committee, particularly Chair Declan McAleer MLA, has raised this as a concern with the minister.Sheep farmers in the mountains have already lost the ACN payment, which we are calling for the reinstatement of. Farmers cant plan or invest and many are genuinely fearful for their livelihoods and the future of their farms and businesses. All of this is a consequence of Brexit and the British government dragging us out of the EU against the democratic will of the majority of people here, and is another example of why Brexit is bad for the people of the north. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The target is that no patient waits more than nine weeks, but  of those iniduals have been waiting in excess of nine weeks, with the longest wait forty-one weeks. In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks. It was recently announced that the Stormont executive is to set up a new working group on mental wellbeing and resilience. googletag.cmd.push It is the first time that the executive has collectively demonstrated determination and unity to tackle mental health issues including suicide. Health minister Robin Swann said the issue requires a strategic, coordinated and sustained approach across government departments. Interventions A Spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trustsaid: “Respecting confidentiality the Western Trust does not comment on the inidual treatment and care of its patients. “Those presenting in crisis to an Emergency Department will be seen within two hours by a mental health professional and will have a thorough mental state assessment. This service operates seven days per week across the Trust. “In addition the Trust also operates the Card Before You Leave scheme . This scheme offers next day appointments with a mental health professional for those presenting with a mental health crisis who have been assessed as being low risk of self-harm.” She continued: “Following assessment patients may be offered a range of interventions including admission,appropriate, to a psychiatric bed, referred for follow-up by an appropriate community mental health team, referred to an appropriate community or voluntary organization or discharged back to the care of their General Practitioner. “There are a range of statutory and voluntary services which respond to those with mental health issues in the Western Trust area. “Services in the voluntary sector can be accessed through self-referral or through referral from mental health services, acute services or Emergency Departments.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

The plaque which is placed in an area where young people would meet will assist in highlighting Lavey’s townland’s, the meanings of their names and their Irish translations. This is particularly important as we strive to retain and keep the historical relevance of our townlands to the fore.

The First XV made their experience known at the Foyle College’s Limavady Road campus, dominating both halves with slick passing, clever footwork and powerful drives forward.Foyle had been aiming to cause an upset as the odds of beating the superior Campbell College were stacked against them. Beating Carrick Grammar - at home in Round  of the competition, Foyle’s coaches Ally Ferguson and Neil Stewart will have relished the opportunity to challenge such a highly rated team in the fourth round tie.Having taken Foyle’s players to Limerick to play against quality teams like Crescent College this year, they had logged an impressive win against Rainey earlier this season. Before the game, Foyle Director of Rugby, Paul O’Kane had highlighted the need to perform from the first whistle but it was not to be as Foyle conceded an unconverted try in the opening  minutes.Despite this, Foyle still looked bright with their forwards dominating scrums in the opening stages albeit conceding possession too easily whilst passing out. Campbell College’s lock D. Harkin drove forward brilliantly utilising skilful footwork and Foyle heads dropped as Harkin brought the ball down in the centre of the try line allowing fly half M. Rae to easily convert, widening the score to  points.A misunderstanding between two Foyle players resulted in a collision in collecting a Campbell drop kick and summed up the gulf in quality and experience between the two sides. Another brilliant run forward with slick hands from Campbell College saw centre L. Kenny score a converted try. Campbell College’s quality of passing was what allowed them to get forward so easily, despite Foyle gaining territory regularly, they were unable to match Campbell’s quality meaning they could not make the most of possession.Driving forward  minutes before half time, Campbell’s centre M. Booth gained another try and fly half R. Rae once again confidently converted to bring the half time score to - googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The heavens opened at half time to compound Foyle’s struggles but the squad looked undeterred lining up for the second half. It was in these opening stages that Campbell showcased their strength in a flurry of rucks and mauls, making the most of possession and flanker J. Jeffery scoring a decisive  points. It was the conversion of this try in the second half that sealed Foyle’s fate bringing a dference of  points and the score that would last the rest of the game. Despite the away team’s D. Harkin and J. Jeffrey dominating rucks and winning possession it was then midway through the second half when the intensity of their drives forward dropped. Knowing there was little chance of Foyle coming back in the game Campbell College allowed Foyle to push forward, maintain possession and come closest to scoring the coveted points they so desperately searched for. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Foyle College break forward. A rouse of the crowd and a succession of line outs close to Campbell’s try line saw tensions rise between the two teams, with a resulting ruck ending in flared tempers. The gain of territory and maintaining of possession from the penalising of a number of high tackles from Campbell College proved fruitless for Foyle however with the away side able to break the lines and push Foyle back into their own half.The final whistle at - sealed Foyle’s fate with an exit from the Danske Medallion Shield but the players shouldn’t be too disheartened by the scoreline. This was a quality side they went up against in Campbell College with a wealth of experience to make the most of their dominance. Foyle Principal, Patrick Allen offered his commiserations to the team on social media stating he was, “proud of the commitment and determination shown by the boys.” It will be an incredibly useful learning curve for Foyle who despite exiting the competition will take the tough lessons learned onto the rest of their season. They should eagerly look forward to facing Campbell College again in the future knowing first hand the quality of one of the best sides in the land.

when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
