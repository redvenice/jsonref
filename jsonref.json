I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, and I really kind of had to just follow my nose and that\u0027s what I did,\u0027 he recalled.What Humble did know was that he wanted to make images in color.\u0027The reason I stopped using a 35mm camera with black and white was because I had come to the end of the trail,\u0027 he said. \u0027When I was looking at my contact sheets at some point, I realized that I was looking at the same pictures I had made before and so I kind of got to the point where I felt, well, I\u0027m done with this. I need to do something else.\u0027When we got that grant for the LA Documentary Project, I decided to move into the large format camera with color and so rather than walking around on the streets making images very quickly and intuitively, they had to be put together in a very kind of rigorous way.\u0027         Photographer John Humble was drawn to the above image, titled Carson, November 13, 1979, because of \u0027the yellow car matching the yellow house,\u0027 and the residence\u0027s proximity to the transformers in the background. \u0027I have a different aesthetic than a lot of photographers,\u0027 he told DailyMail.com. \u0027To me, LA was a place and is a place where the industrial machine is of great consequence and exists in very close proximity to where people live.\u0027 California\u0027s economy currently ranks fifth in the world, and Humble noted that in 1979 and 1980, the state was producing a lot in Los Angeles          \u0027My pictures are all seen from a moving car and so I drove around Los Angeles, looked out the window and when I would see something I thought might be interesting to be photographed, I would stop and then I would take a look at it,\u0027 Humble told DailyMail.com. \u0027In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem. You\u0027re just stuck, you can get around but it\u0027s not easy.\u0027 Above, an image titled Olympic Boulevard and Ford Boulevard, East Los Angeles, February 8, 1980         For his images, Humble explained that he used cibachrome \u0027because when I started making photographs in color, color was pretty fugitive. And in fact there had been some real scandals about how long color materials lasted.\u0027 He told DailyMail.com that the cibachrome process was one that did not fade easy, but that it was also arduous. During the development process bleach was used to get rid of dye that was already part of the material. \u0027I wore an industrial respirator and long rubber gloves to keep any of that bleach off my skin because if it got on your skin, it would burn you.\u0027 Above, an image titled 3790 Olympic Boulevard, East Los Angeles, February 7, 1980         The above image, titled Pacific Coast Highway at Alameda Street., Wilmington, November 15, 1979, was one of the first photos that Humble took for what would become the LA Documentary Project. Humble also had changed from black and white to color and to a large format camera. \u0027Anything made in... \u002779 is the very first days of me making photographs with that view camera and quite frankly I didn\u0027t know what I was doing with that camera. I mean, you know, it\u0027s a very complicated machine, it doesn\u0027t look like it, but it is with all the different ways you can tilt and swing, with the front and the back,\u0027 he told DailyMail.com. \u0027I was completely self-taught when it comes to using the view camera and color\u0027He switched to a 4x5 camera, which requires a dark cloth, placing inidual pieces of film in its back, and time to set up its tripod. Humble also decided to use cibachrome for developing his large prints.\u0027The cibachrome process is one that does not fade easy,\u0027 he explained, adding that \u0027the material actually already had the layers of dye there\u0027 and that during the development process certain areas of dye were bleached away.While the result is images that were durable and long-lasting, he said the procedure was laborious. \u0027I wore an industrial respirator and long rubber gloves to keep any of that bleach off my skin because if it got on your skin, it would burn you.\u0027The colors in the images beam: the yellow car and house, the bright reds of a billboard advertising the Sands in Las Vegas and in the sign for a topless cabaret, and the green of a car next to a place selling ice.  Often, Humble drove around the city in his Volkswagen van in neighborhoods such as East LA and Wilmington - not Beverly Hills or Brentwood.  In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem \u0027In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem,\u0027 he said. \u0027My pictures are all seen from a moving car and so I drove around Los Angeles, looked out the window and when I would see something I thought might be interesting to be photographed, I would stop and then I would take a look at it.\u0027The top of his van also served as a perch for Humble to take pictures from, giving him a vantage point that was different than standing on the street. \u0027I was able to see things and include things in the photographs that I couldn\u0027t have otherwise seen or included.\u0027 Humble has now lived in Los Angeles for 45 years and continues to chronicle the city – more recently two streets, Vermont and Pico, and its downtown. \u0027Downtown LA has been gentrifying for about the last four or five years at an astonishing rate.\u0027I used to walk up and down a street called Broadway downtown and it was all Latinos and all the stores catered to Latino people. And now when you walk up and down Broadway, it\u0027s yuppies with dogs and the stores have all changed and they\u0027re expensive restaurants and things like that that never existed downtown before.\u0027The images he took for the documentary project are now a testament to places, such as the topless cabaret, that are now gone.Nonetheless, the city continues to offer Humble its photographic gifts.\u0027It still surprises me all the time. And I\u0027ll still drive around the corner of someplace I haven\u0027t been before and see something and go, Oh, my God, that\u0027s incredible. And it\u0027s nothing, you know, something nobody else would look at.\u0027         After the LA Documentary Project finished, Humble continued to chronicle the city he has now lived in for 45 years. He noted that many of places he took pictures of during the late 1970s and early 1980s are now gone or have completely changed, such as the image above titled Downtown Los Angeles from Wall Street., Los Angeles, October 24, 1979. \u0027That was another one where I drove by and I looked at and I thought, Well, there\u0027s nothing there. I mean why would you make a picture of that?\u0027 He said the above street scene is bucolic         Other recent photographic projects that Humble has done include documenting the city\u0027s streets, such as Vermont and Pico, and downtown, which he said \u0027has been gentrifying for about the last four or five years at an astonishing rate. I used to walk up and down a street called Broadway downtown and it was all Latinos and all the stores catered to Latino people. And now when you walk up and down Broadway, it\u0027s yuppies with dogs and the stores have all changed and they\u0027re expensive restaurants and things like that that never existed downtown before.\u0027 Above, an image titled 5304 Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, November 6, 1979         Humble said that he used power lines, as seen above, to break up the sky in images. It was important to him that he showed a city beyond the representation of palm trees and people in fancy cars. \u0027That\u0027s what I wanted to do was to go around to the different parts of LA that people really probably didn\u0027t go into very much or pay much attention to and photograph these things that I thought really were indicative or emblematic of Los Angeles and how we live in Los Angeles – how most people live in Los Angeles.\u0027 Above, an image titled View West from 2700 Block, Guirado Street., East Los Angeles, February 8, 1980         \u0027LA is all about commerce,\u0027 Humble said of the above image titled 349 Rose Avenue, Venice, July 7, 1980. He noted the billboard blaring \u0027It\u0027s Chevy\u0027s Homecoming\u0027 between the two homes. While taking the photo, a woman came out of the salmon-colored house smoking a cigarette. Humble said that he spent a lot of time thinking about philosophy, painting and photography before he took the images for the LA Documentary Project. He said: \u0027They\u0027re pretty edgy pictures in a way\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE James Middleton celebrates healthy profits exploding card firm Boomf","story":"Share this article   Martha Lane Fox has revealed that she would like to have been a Hollywood starlet. The 46-year-old internet entrepreneur, who co-founded late travel deals website lastminute.com in 1998, says: \u0027I\u0027m a frustrated actress and would love to have had a successful Hollywood career like my heroine Hedy Lamarr.Unfortunately, I\u0027m not nearly as racy as Hedy and not a fraction as glamorous.\u0027Lamarr, who died in 2000 aged 85, was almost as famous for her colourful private life — she married six times — as for inventing 1940s technology that led to GPS, wi-fi and Bluetooth.            Luciana Gimenez, 50, has marked the festive season by slipping into a shiny gold leotard and red stockings for a picture, which she shared onlineSir Mick Jagger\u0027s former lover, Brazilian TV host Luciana Gimenez, refuses to let being single spoil Christmas.The 50-year-old mother of the Rolling Stone\u0027s son Lucas, 20, has marked the festive season by slipping into a shiny gold leotard and red stockings for a picture, which she shared online.Last year, she split from her husband, media executive Marcelo de Carvalho, with whom she has an eight-year-old son, Lorenzo.\u0027I am alone and happy,\u0027 she says. \u0027Mick is a wonderful father, just like Marcelo.

Old customs get replaced. We swap comfortably familiar habits for more progressive ways of doing things.This year, amid the urgency of our climate crisis and the toll it’s taking on some of the world’s poorest people, many of us might be tempted to finally break with the modern tradition of treating Christmas as one giant consumerism fest.Other retail analysts attribute the change to something closer to consumer self-interest. “History shows that people’s social consciousness ranks way below their own direct economic wellbeing,” says retail expert Richard Hyman. “People are feeling anxious and uncertain about the future, though, and that is encouraging caution.”Either way, festive gifting is changing. It isn’t about being a Scrooge or killjoy or ditching presents altogether. It’s about reimagining Christmas gifts to make them more sustainable and meaningful – whether it’s buying each other experiences instead of physical gifts, trawling charity shops for ethically produced products or pre-loved possessions, or pooling funds with loved ones to rent somewhere to get together over the break.After all, Christmas gift-giving has long become unmoored from the Christmas spirit – distorted by a sense of obligatory quid pro quo and a feeling that we have to prove our affection with the price tag of our presents. It’s also economically inefficient.Joel Waldfogel, a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota, has been studying the economic waste of festive gift-giving since 1993, when he coined the term “the deadweight loss of Christmas” in a research paper investigating how people waste their money trying to guess what someone else would like. He argued that gifts typically destroy value because the giver would pay more for a gift than the recipient would have been prepared to spend on it. His 2009 book Scroogenomics: Why You Shouldn’t Buy Presents for the Holidays, expanded on his ideas.“In the early 1990s … people were blinded by their good intentions, unable to see any problem in holiday gift-giving,” says Waldfogel. “People are now more concerned about both wastefulness and associated environmental degradation, as well as the awful juxtaposition of rich people getting stuff they don’t want while many problems of the truly needy are not addressed.”A rethink of festive gifting has also been prompted by a glut of possessions and people’s tendency to live in smaller homes – a trend famously highlighted by Ikea’s former chief sustainability officer, Steve Howard, who, in 2016, declared that consumers in the west “have probably hit peak stuff”.Since then, a variety of projects and ventures have sprung up to make it easier for consumers to reimagine Christmas gift-giving. One example is Advent of Change, which subverts the traditional advent calendar so that instead of doling out gifts or treats, each of the 24 doors reveals a donation to charity, which is included in the purchase price. “Christmas had become quite commercialised in recent years, but now it is changing quite rapidly the other way,” says founder Kristina Salceanu. “People are becoming a lot more aware that their purchases can have a big impact.”There have also been a raft of alternative e-commerce sites, such as online marketplaces for handmade and vintage gifts. Patchwork, for instance, was set up as a group gifting platform akin to a digital whip-round. “The established convention for gift giving, especially at Christmas, is to get in a panic and spend money we don’t have buying people things they don’t need,” says founder Olivia Knight. “Most people use Patchwork to collectively fund experiences in lieu of physical gifts – they’re worried about the environmental impact of consumerism. We are increasingly seeing people using it to ask family to contribute gift money towards a good cause too.”Oxfam Unwrapped gift cards, from £5These poverty-busting cards help transform lives around the world.Preloved books, from £0.99First editions, cookery and children’s books available in store and online.Sourced by Oxfam Homeware, from £2.50New, ethical and sustainable items such as a fairtrade plant basket (£24.99).For inspiration on gifts that don’t hurt the planet and the people in it, visit the Oxfam Christmas gift guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb23deb9637b17c1e0b4ddd595dd84806257326/1116_346_4900_2941/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401ec64055e97aaa827ba42bce9c81d3","title":"give joy without the junk and prepare poems for loved ones christmas morning reimagined","story":"Beyond gathering around the tree to open presents, why not sing carols with the family or volunteer for a charity this year? Breaking traditions never felt so good on your conscience – and the environmentThe stereotypical Christmas morning involves frosty white snow, warm families and children getting up at the crack of dawn to rip open stockings full of glittering wrapping paper, sugary treats and plastic toys that will probably be discarded by lunchtime.But as we seek to reimagine a more environmentally friendly Christmas, what might we do when dawn breaks on the 25th to ensure we generate less junk and more joy?Play swap. Ilana Taub, co-founder of environmental consultancy Bolder and the Snact fruit snacks with compostable packaging, suggests a swap session with family and friends. “We all own so many things we don’t use, so how about a Secret Santa with meaningful or useful things we own,” she suggests. “It will hopefully get people thinking about whether they need all the stuff they already have.” Pre-loved Christmas gifts from your local charity shop are ideal things to swap – with the added benefit of having raised a bit of money for good causes.Sing in the season. Carols are a staple part of Christmas when you’re at school, but many of us fall out of practice as we get older. This is as shame as, even if you can’t carry a tune, the melodies and harmonies for classics such as Silent Night and Once in Royal David’s City are relatively easy to pick up again. Rehearse enough ahead of Christmas and you can – with the help of a keyboard, guitar, recorder or even a piano app – be serenading your family in four-part harmony. Failing that, consider a singalong to the pop classics, such as Little Drummer Boy, Mary’s Boy Child and White Christmas, with the help of YouTube. Singing together as a family is a good way of bonding – and making everyone feel less self-conscious about their vocal abilities.Prepare some poems. Take a leaf from the Dutch tradition of celebrating Saint Nicholas by writing other members of the family a fun, poetic tribute. Gently tease them for their foibles, praise them in word play for recent achievements, and read the poems aloud on Christmas morning to give everyone some light relief. OK, this is easier in Dutch, which has fewer words, and a lot of rhyming endings, but there are plenty of seasonal favourites to take inspiration from, such as AA Milne’s King John’s Christmas.Take a brisk walk. Instead of trying to walk after lunch – when, let’s be honest, you probably won’t get far – use the morning to enjoy the lack of crowds and cars on the road. Wrap up warm, don your home-knitted beanie and take some time in the outdoors – preferably up a picturesque snow-covered hill, with dogs, children andor grandparents.Push the red envelope. One way of reducing wastefulness when gifting is to take inspiration from the Chinese new year tradition of giving children money in a red envelope so that they can save up and buy something they really want. Economists point out that this makes for much more efficient resource allocation than traditional festive-gifting. Giving cash rather than badly-judged gifts can also encourage kids to work out the cost of their presents and help them appreciate the value of money.Decorate the tree. Instead of opening brand new gifts under the tree, why not save Christmas morning as a festive time to decorate your tree? There are two options when it comes to the tree itself: one is plastic, as long as it’s going to last at least a few decades. Government waste reduction body Wrap states that “artificial trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have a lesser impact than natural alternatives”. Alternatively, a real tree that can be put in your garden, either in its pot or planted into the soil, can give you joy all year round – and even make an appearance next Christmas. You could even use Christmas morning to bake the ultimate environmentally friendly decorations: tree biscuits. They just go soft if you make them in advance, anyway.Give the gift of your time. What could be more in the spirit of Christmas than to volunteer? Charities and good causes offer Christmas meals for those without family to go to – and many of these people welcome help getting there. You could do a shift at a shelter, help cook or prepare for a Christmas party, or even hold your own community event. (Of course, this kind of giving doesn’t just apply on Christmas morning – charity shops are often desperate for extra pairs of hands in the run-up to the big day!)Wrapping it all up. If you do decide to exchange gifts (after ensuring they’re environmentally friendly and ethically sourced), bear in mind that glittery wrapping paper and plastic bows can’t be recycled. Studies show that each British household uses four rolls of paper wrap for stocking presents and gifts, and Wrap reckons the amount of wrapping paper thrown away at Christmas in the UK alone would stretch to the moon. Dr Aiduan Borrion, associate professor of University College London’s Circular Economy Lab, recommends choosing packaging with care. “A lot of wrapping paper has plastics or glitter on it, and isn’t suitable for recycling,” she says. “Look at an alternative way of wrapping presents using recyclable papers or box baskets, which you can then use for different occasions. Newspaper is also a very common way of wrapping gifts, and you can also look at using reusable fabric.”Plenty of stores and charity shops sell eco-aware paper nowadays, and Oxfam’s high street shops sell a range of recycled and craft-based options that are responsibly sourced.

As a documentary charts his journey where Israel and Palestine meet, Koudelka talks about challenging official narratives – and himself There’s a surreal moment near the start of Koudelka Shooting Holy Land, a documentary about the acclaimed photographer Josef Koudelka. He has pointed his lens at one of the concrete barriers that separate Israel and Palestine but has been stopped by an official and a heavily armed soldier. His local assistant, Gilad Baram, is trying to smooth things over. “It might result in a book,” Baram tells the soldier. “He is a one of the most renowned photographers worldwide. He is a photographer with an agency called Magnum.”Suddenly the atmosphere changes. “Magnum? Ah, I know it,” says the soldier, his stern face breaking into a smile. A short discussion later, a friendly handshake and all is well.It is one of many quietly absurd scenes in Koudelka Shooting Holy Land, filmed on lengthy visits Koudelka took to the region between 2008 and 2012, making work that was published in the book Wall: Israeli and Palestinian Landscape. In another scene, Koudelka goes to a fake Arab city, built by the Israeli army for practice manoeuvres so realistic they even include actors pretending to sell vegetables in the “marketplace”. Later in the film, he observes a tour guide in Hebron, in West Bank, telling his group that, while they and Jewish settlers can walk freely up and down a particular street, the Palestinian residents can only go as far as “up to this door”.“These places have so much absurdity in them,” says Baram. “Of course, they are also a reminder of a painful reality. The film had to reflect that.”Baram was a photography student when he was assigned to help Koudelka, one of 12 international photographers invited to the region to participate in a group project, This Place. Driving Koudelka around, translating and facilitating access, Baram became fascinated by the journalist’s unique approach to photography, and started to film him. Initially, Koudelka was very suspicious.Initially, Koudelka didn’t want to work in Israel because he was wary of “getting mixed up” and emotionally involved – he paid for his first trip there himself so he wouldn’t feel beholden. Then Koudelka found himself deeply interested in the barrier built by Israel in the West Bank, which struck a chord because of his own experience of living behind the iron curtain.See it through his own eyes he does, as Baram’s film shows. Koudelka, who was in his 70s on these trips, worked long hours every day, walking along both sides of the barrier, speaking with those he encountered and taking photographs of the landscape. He returned to the same places over the years to see them at different times of the day or year, or in different weather.Baram’s film opens with a two-minute single, static shot of Koudelka at the fortified entrance road to Rachel’s Tomb. The photographer keeps shifting slightly to get the image exactly right. “You want to see everything, as much as possible, and to find the place where you think the photograph is waiting for you, and then build from these pieces a mosaic that can make a certain statement,” he explains.Such independence has characterised Koudelka’s long career. In 1968, he witnessed the Soviets violently suppress the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia and took to the streets, photographing the locals but also the invading soldiers. He didn’t feel hatred towards them, he says in the documentary. “I felt that what happened to them could happen to me. One night they could wake me up, put me on the tank, and I could be somewhere, in Warsaw or in Bucharest, in their situation. So then you’re a soldier and, in most cases, a soldier does what he is told to do.”For the past three decades, Koudelka has used a panoramic camera and photographed landscapes shaped by human activity. The scenes he depicts are usually devoid of people, but human actions have changed everything, whether it’s scarring the landscape with mines or huge concrete barriers, or building the roads, fortresses, and temples. These human interventions are an expression of power over the environment, and over each other. “Control over sources of water is one example,” he says. “You start by making roads – if you have the infrastructure, it helps you to establish your domination.”He believes people should interpret his photographs for themselves, but his images of the barrier in the West Bank are undeniably bleak. A long-distance shot of the Shu’afat refugee camp shows a nine-foot concrete barrier snaking all the way down from one corner of Koudelka’s wide panoramic image to the other his depiction of the entrance to Rachel’s Tomb shows the walls closing in like a prison.“Photography is so easy,” he says. “You just press the button. But photography is so difficult. There are some photographers, a few, who have got a vision. There are many more who have got a certain style. What is vision? It is, I think, where you were born, how you grow up, what sort of parents you had, the education you got, whatever happened to you, and how finally you get to a certain point. Style you can copy very easily. Vision, not really.”• Learn more about the documentary at koudelka-film.

I then kind of fell into a mushroom wormhole … there is so much enthusiasm for mushrooms and so much innovation.“Everyone loves a mushroom, it makes people happy. There is something light-hearted to it and perhaps it’s an antidote to a lot of the conceptualism of contemporary art.”Gavin has unearthed some fascinating stories for the exhibition. For example, Cage’s lifelong interest in mushrooms, which led him to reviving the New York Mycological Society in the 1950s.To make some extra money he also supplied hotels including the Four Seasons with mushrooms he foraged in upstate New York.“He’s actually better known in Italy for his love of mushrooms than he is for his music, which I think is amazing,” said Gavin.For Cage, it was as much about the foraging as it was the mushroom.“If you think about the peacefulness and space in his work, I think that was very much connected with his love of foraging,” she said.Going on display will be a rare mushroom book he published with the mycologist Alexander H Smith and illustrator Lois Long, which includes Cage’s poetry and handwritten notes on the the subject.Cage’s passion and interest in mycology will be a surprise to many, as will Potter’s.Over the course of a decade, before she found fame as a writer, Potter completed about 300 fungi and lichen paintings in startling detail. “They are just so beautiful,” said Gavin. “She was very young when she was doing them … you can see her children’s books as an extension of making narratives around that connection to nature.”Potter also studied fungi under a microscope and presented a paper, On the germination of the spores of Agaricineae, to the Linnean Society of London in 1897.Other mushroom-loving artists in the show include Cy Twombly, represented by prints of a quasi-scientific series he made in 1974 called Natural History Part I, Mushrooms.Work by designers include a biodegradable mushroom burial suit by Jae Rhim Lee, which aims to reduce the environmental cost of the funeral industry, and a mycelium high-heeled shoe by the Belgian shoe designer Kristel Peters.Gavin said she had learned much since she began research for the show and lots of fascinating mushroom facts would be included. For example the 965-hectare (2,384-acre) mushroom in north Oregon, which is considered the world’s biggest and oldest organism.One reason mushrooms are in the zeitgeist is our need to reconnect with nature, said Gavin. “We’re living in this moment where life has become so urbanised and technology focused.”Another reason is simply that mushrooms are so aesthetically pleasing and people love them. “Honestly, I’ve never had a response like this to an exhibition, people are really excited.”• Mushrooms: The art, design and future of fungi is at Somerset House 31 January-26 April 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a30cbef5fe52e45a7eefc4e5d968a89469792e/0_74_2220_1332/master/2220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab72add758ed39a1806ed4a96d76d655","title":"beneath modern melbourne a window opens into its ancient history","story":"Researchers are drilling into remnant billabongs across the city to document the landscape as it was under Aboriginal managementIt’s a Wednesday morning, and as commuters make their way toward the city along Bulleen Road – a busy thoroughfare in Melbourne’s north-east – several vehicles detour into an easily overlooked, unsealed car park.A team of geographers gather on the shores of the brown and shallow Bolin Bolin billabong, a stone’s throw from modern Melbourne but a world away, where the dull roar of traffic fades behind the warbling of magpies and the rustle of the breeze through the trees.

From there, Fletcher and his crew will drill and extract four sediment cores from beneath the still water. Inside these muddy cores are clues about the hidden, potent history of this place stretching back several millennia.“We’re trying to really reimagine Melbourne, as it was prior to British invasion and under Aboriginal management,” Fletcher says.By analysing the sediment – from the traces of pollen, and layers of charcoal and organic matter, to the DNA of lost creatures and micro-organisms – with the local Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders and community, Fletcher will add to the collective knowledge of this secluded spot.This coring exercise is phase one of a research program using scientific and Indigenous knowledge to document remnant billabongs across Melbourne. It’s about “helping Melbourne reconnect to its hidden treasures,” Fletcher says.The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people are the traditional owners of the Bulleen and Heidelberg area, which was connected to Melbourne through the Birrarung river system. The Melbourne area was once so lush with waterways and bushland that palaeontologist and conservationist Tim Flannery likened it to a “temperate Kakadu”.The billabong off Bulleen Road, now bordered by sporting fields, golf courses and roads, was part of a vast system flowing out from the Birrarung – the Yarra river.It’s hard to conjure what has been lost. Where Crown Casino sits today “was a giant swamp”, Fletcher says. “There was a waterfall where Elizabeth Street flows into the Yarra, and where Spencer Street was, there was actually a rock bar across the river.”Yarra “improvement” works in the late 1800s, at the height of the gold-rush expansion of “marvellous Melbourne”, severed the Bolin Bolin billabong and others like it from the river. Natural flooding was interrupting day-to-day life as the city grew, Fletcher says.This billabong is one of five that remain in urban Melbourne. With the rest long since filled in or turned into tips by colonisers, this place is all the more precious, providing an “ecological window into what the billabong system used to look like”, Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elder Uncle Dave Wandin says.Fletcher has studied many similar sites across Australia, and observes that the removal of Aboriginal land management after colonisation led to ecosystems becoming less erse and less healthy.By midday, he has collected the first of four cores, after rowing out to the pontoon with his crew and using a two-metre-long metal stick to push a clear plastic tube deep into the earth beneath the metre-deep water.Back on shore, he holds the long-buried treasure. Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders including Wandin and Alice Kolasa, and water and land managers from the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung cultural heritage corporation, join the scientists in the field to discuss the coring and analysis.They focus their attention on the first core. A full laboratory analysis will take about six months and involve high-tech geothermal scanning. But this core already tells the story of the billabong’s post-colonial decline.The top section – containing the most recent sediment – looks more like tar than earth. There’s a distinct change in colour about a third of the way down, from deep, jet black to a lighter, healthier brown.“There’s a definite change from here,” Fletcher says, pointing to the bottom of the tube, “into this really black muck. I think this black muck is going to be post-British kind of pollution. It really stinks, and it’s just yuck.”Wandin is a key fire knowledge holder and helped to develop the Victorian traditional owners’ cultural fire strategy. He hopes the analysis of charcoal within the core will provide clues about traditional Indigenous practices in burning and managing the site. This could inform the use of fire to promote natural regeneration around the billabong, rather than relying on chemicals to control weeds.“I look at a landscape and try and imagine what it was … and that’s going to give me information,” he says. “Hopefully we’ll find out from the charcoal in this the frequency of burning and the type of burning.”Fletcher and Wandin discuss how the area around the billabong has become cluttered with trees and wild undergrowth. They point to one enormous red gum which shows the changes that have played out. It branches outwards, rather than upwards – a sign it grew in a much more open landscape, not among today’s closely grown “mess”, as Wandin describes it.Listening in on this exchange is Delta Lucille Freedman, project manager for the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung corporation, who is conducting a cultural values study of the Bulleen-Banyule Flats area on behalf of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. What she hears resonates with archival material from Melbourne surveyor Robert Hoddle and pastoral holders, who frequently wrote that this landscape was a thinly wooded grassland. Observations of broader Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung country indicate it was burnt in the warmer months.The grasses are now pasture grasses rather than native ones, which has an impact on insect health. If the seeds of the old vegetation can be sourced, significant replanting could be undertaken by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Narrap rangers, an Indigenous land management team.“From an anthropological perspective, it was not a natural landscape but a cultural landscape that was shaped over millennia by Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung beliefs, traditions and land management,” she says.Back in 1840, in the early days of colonisation, Woi Wurrung people made a request to the Port Phillip Aboriginal protectorate for a permanent reserve to be established in this area. Because non-Indigenous settlers were already on the land, Nerre Nerre Warren reserve was chosen instead, but the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung continued to live in the area and practiced their traditions on this land until they were moved onto Acheron Station in 1859.“When we were kicked out, we weren’t allowed to go back down into the city,” Wandin says. “This is sort of the closest where we felt comfortable, where we weren’t really interfering.” The Bolin Bolin billabong was an important area for ceremonies and dances involving neighbouring clans, a gathering place, and had an ecosystem that could support between 300 and 500 people, he says. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people would have fished for eels by burning the reeds in the still water here, knowing they would congregate in the warm shallows. They could then be fished with a spear.“It’s like a day spa for an eel,” Wandin jokes. They would have come here to shed fat and then migrated north in their epic journey to the saltwater of the Coral Sea to breed. In running water, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung would have used stone eel traps, a common practice across Victorian Aboriginal groups.“It looks beautiful, it looks nice and green – but it’s not its natural landscape,” Wandin says. “But it doesn’t mean we just leave it alone and do nothing.“We call it caring for country today, but it’s caring for our mother … she nurtured us, she nurtured our ancestors and she’ll continue to nurture us if we look after her in the way that she’s been looked after for tens of thousands of years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

This would be an achievement for any artist, but for one living in the 18th century, when lives and careers generally stopped at 40, it was extraordinary. Delany had spent decades being competent at all the usual “accomplishments” required of a genteel Georgian woman: embroidering napkins, sketching landscapes and, oddest of all, sticking sea shells to mantelpieces to make them look like plaster stucco. But at some point, sitting out in the garden in the golden late summer of 1772, she felt inspired to pick up her scissors and start snipping into coloured paper to see if she could recreate the shape of the plants spread out before her. Thrilled by the results, Delany wrote cock-a-hoop to her niece a few weeks later: “I have invented a new way of imitating flowers.”Actually, she had done a lot more. Far from making simple cut-outs, Delany had created a new kind of art (pictured right). Over the top of her petal template she would typically paste a multitude of smaller cuts to create shading and depth, which she then touched up with watercolour. One flower alone could easily contain more than 200 bits of paper. She called her work “mosaiks” we might describe them as mixed-media collage. More than mere botanical description, they function as a kind of floral portraiture, designed to show off a plant to its best advantage. Untidy leaves have been lopped off, droopy petals edited out, and the stamens sing with such hallucinatory colour that it feels as though they have transcended naturalism and now exist in a world of pure form.By the time of her death at the age of 88, Delany had produced almost a thousand flower images that were the delight and wonder of her smart social set. It had been in the magnificent gardens of the Duchess of Portland’s Bulstrode estate in Buckinghamshire that she had experienced her eureka moment. Joseph Banks, the celebrity naturalist, was an early fan of her work, while her later specimens were provided by no less a cheerleader than Queen Charlotte. Meticulously organised into 10 handsome albums, the Flora Delanica was bequeathed by a great-niece to the British Museum in 1897. Far from languishing in a dusty drawer along with all those other indecipherable traces of the vernacular past, Delany’s flowers remain some of the most visited works in the museum’s department of prints and drawings.The irresistibly odd shape of Delany’s life and work has previously attracted both popular and scholarly biographies, but Clarissa Campbell Orr hits the sweet spot between rigour and readability. In particular, she wants us to understand how the blazing serenity of Delany’s late-blooming art was born from decades of personal and political turbulence. At the age of 17 Mary Granville, the daughter of a disgraced minor Jacobite aristocrat, was married off for cash to a lechy 60-year-old called Alexander Pendarves, who had nothing but his profitable Cornish tin mine to recommend him. Released by his death after a mercifully short six years – gout galloped through Pendarves – Mary now embarked on a careful widowhood that lasted two decades.Campbell Orr is good at making us see why young Mary, who had missed out on becoming rich as a result of her rotten husband failing to update his will, nonetheless chose to turn down no fewer than eight proposals of marriage. There was a toxic bachelor called Lord Baltimore, whom she dubbed “the Basilisk”, and another man with a big fortune who struck her as simply “silly”. The offer from a widower with five young children naturally appalled her, as did a proposal from the doomy religious poet Edward Young, who, despite living in an age of Augustan wit, resorted to teasing her about her spider phobia.Rather than marry one of these buffoons, Mary carved out for herself a much pleasanter life as a free agent. She was careful to avoid any suggestion of being “light” by shunning gaming tables and keeping her friendships with men – John Wesley, Jonathan Swift, Horace Walpole – strictly platonic. Only when she was sure that her fertile years were behind her did she take a second husband, a nice Irish cleric called Patrick Delany, who soothed her soul even if he did not enrich her coffers.Quite why Mary turned, four years after Delany’s death in 1768, to cutting flowers out of coloured paper remains a mystery. And it is a great strength of Campbell Orr’s book that she doesn’t pretend to solve it. Nor does she insist on squeezing the Flora Delanica into a grand theory about the suppression of female artistic practice in the 18th century. Indeed, she admits that Delany’s productions, which straddle devotion and decoration, kitsch and craft, remain hard to place and difficult to decipher. But they are nonetheless gloriously easy to enjoy, and it is that sense of Delany’s life and work as a pleasurable puzzle that makes this exquisitely illustrated book such a treat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df33035fd49e7d3d23e370bf65a78cc385c28d9/0_249_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=578e1efe1ac5c61cd2db9258431604a9","title":"top 10 books about loneliness","story":"At what can be one of the loneliest times of year, a historian of emotion picks the best books about a modern maladyLoneliness is everywhere. Or so it seems. It’s been described in medical terms, as an epidemic, plague and infection. It has its own minister in the UK, Baroness Barran, with indications that other countries – Switzerland, Germany, maybe even the US – may follow suit.The problem is that loneliness is seldom defined. It’s often presented as an inidual, even universal, mental affliction. But loneliness is relatively new. The word comes into common usage around 1800, linked to social change – especially the secularity, alienation and competition produced by modernity. Before then it was solitude that interested writers and philosophers. Solitude could be problematic, but in a landscape forged by God, was one ever alone?Loneliness is different at different times. Yes, it can be desperate and crushing and agonising. But it can also be temporary, transitory, a “pinch-point” or life stage. Loneliness is not a single emotion but a mix of different feelings, including anger, resentment and fear as well as sorrow, grief and shame. It can even be pleasurable.As a historian of emotion, these complexities, and the absence of any existing extended historical inquiry, inspired my new book, A Biography of Loneliness. With case studies that include Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria and Thomas Turner, it explores the emergence of loneliness as a modern, physical and psychological affliction. And it considers the role played by political, social and economic factors (including the fact that the loneliest of all – homeless people and refugees – are not covered by the paper-thin umbrella of government concern).I chose these 10 books for what they have to say inidually, as well as what they represent collectively, about the historically changing meanings of loneliness. Many are written by women, because the connections between loneliness, creativity and gender are a neglected but critical aspect of modern and contemporary writing.1. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1719)Drenched in the contemporaneous racism of crusaders and cannibals, Robinson Crusoe is often read as a study in religious redemption and a search for the self. Unlike Tom Hanks’s character in the Crusoe-inspired film Castaway (2000), Crusoe is not lonely. The word is never mentioned and he may rail at God, but the universe he inhabits has certainty and meaning.2. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818)This well-known tale (by a writer still, depressingly often, dismissed as “Shelley’s wife”) is one of the first fictive attempts to identify loneliness and social disconnect. Written when science was being “mastered”, and drawing on concerns about social alienation and the exploitation of nature, Frankenstein was also written when the word loneliness was just emerging. It contains just two references to loneliness (and one of those is a lonely road, reflecting its unemotional origin as a synonym for solitude). Yet the angst of Frankenstein’s monster, guilty of sin, abandoned and lost, expresses a remarkably familiar, modern version of loneliness.3. The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall (1928)One of the earliest, best-known accounts of lesbian experience in British and American culture, this novel raises important questions about gender, sexuality, and “belonging” broadly defined. Though its language of “sexual inversion” and “inverts” is archaic, the novel brought attention to the core themes of loneliness and alienation that resulted from early 20th-century anti-gay rhetoric. A recurring theme of LGBTQ+ discussions in the 21st century has been loneliness, especially when linked to mental illness and minority stress.4. A Writer’s Diary by Virginia Woolf (1953)By the 1940s, when “loneliness” was in widespread use to mean emotional isolation, Woolf wrote of its uses. For how else, other than through loneliness, could she disconnect from the world? Published posthumously by her husband Leonard, the book comprises extracts from the diaries she kept from 1918 until 1941, the year she died by suicide. It is filled with fascinating detail on her writing life and the Bloomsbury set of which she was part, as well as critical reflections on loneliness in a gendered world.5. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath (first published in 1963 under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas)Plath’s novel explores a loneliness that again stemmed from social expectation – this time, what it was to be a woman in the 1950s, juggling the expectations of work, domesticity and desire. The agonising loneliness and mental illness described by its narrator Esther Greenwood connect to Plath’s own life, as described in her journals and letters. Plath killed herself just one month after its publication.6. Journal of a Solitude by Mary Sarton (1973)An American poet and writer, Sarton wrote this book in order to record her experiences of depression and loneliness. The Journal was widely regarded as a landmark in women’s autobiography. Like Woolf, Sarton wrote about loneliness as necessary for creativity. But her writing also echoes Romantic ideas about the creator being in nature, and the need for physical connectedness to the world in order to belong.7. Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John T Cacioppo and William Patrick (2009)In the early 21st century, loneliness began to be a medical as well as a social concern. In light of an ageing population, with health risks attached to loneliness, post-industrial societies needed to look at causes. Together with his wife Stephanie, the late John Cacioppo (et al) undertook path-breaking work in the neuroscience of loneliness. This book was one of the first to describe loneliness as a form of contagion it gives a neuroscientific explanation for the physical damage caused by social isolation, from hearts and neurons to the immune system.8. The Lonely City by Olivia Laing (2016)Laing explores the paradox of loneliness in the city – multitudes of others alongside an “omnipresent, unanswerable feeling that I was in a state of lack”. She also considers the sense of blame attached (which reminds me of the dismissal of lonely people in the UK as “Billy no-mates”, as though they are lonely for a reason). Loneliness can bring creativity, too, Laing reminds us, via a (strikingly male) lineup of artists that includes Edward Hopper, Edward Darger and Andy Warhol.9. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)The winner of the 2017 Costa first novel award, this book focuses on the eponymous social misfit, who is isolated and lonely. An abusive childhood, facial scarring and her social awkwardness contribute to her sense of being misunderstood. When asked how she is, she always replies: “Absolutely fine.” It is only when she befriends Raymond, or is befriended by him, that she begins to understand how to have a friend, and to belong.10. Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari (2018)Hari’s book is a reminder of how devastating loneliness can be, despite all its creative possibilities. This is an important study of depression as a social problem, against a backdrop of medical reductionism: depression as a problem of mind (or rather, brain). It is unmet need that Hari sees at the centre of rising levels of depression and anxiety. We are back to Cacioppo’s need for social connections – with Hari’s conclusion that their loss, as the book’s subtitle suggests, is the real cause of depression.• A Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion by Fay Bound Alberti is published by Oxford University Press.

More than £1bn is likely to be spent digitally on Christmas Day according to the Centre for Retail Research.IMRG, the online retailers’ body, said Christmas Day was not only about picking up bargains using vouchers and cash received as a gift. “Gifting companies say there is a massive spike in buying an experience, like a hotel break or driving a car, on Christmas morning as people forget to buy a present for people and those gifts are instant.”But for some, Boxing Day remains an opportunity to treat themselves after the hectic buildup is over. “It is like an oasis after the mayhem and pressure of buying presents for other people,” said Wehrle. “You can go shopping for a few hours and have something to eat or go to the cinema. I think it’s less about standing in a queue waiting for a department store to open so you can grab a bargain.”While many retailers have been offering discounts for months, household names such as Next, John Lewis, Harrods and Selfridges tend to hold back until Boxing Day or the 27th, creating events that can still draw a crowd.The property firm Intu said it expected more than 1 million people to flock to its shopping centres, which include Lakeside in Essex and the centre in Gateshead, on Boxing Day.Its commercial director, Trevor Pereira, said: “We expect it to be one of our busiest shopping days of the year. Going shopping on Boxing Day is a yearly tradition for many and people come to our centres to enjoy a great experience that cannot be matched online.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17bc351d8e558620e89dbc4039d03715666e6013/0_167_4100_2460/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3b32442e860be04eac9e490ca4fa3f","title":"the christmas story of one tube stations mind the gap voice","story":"If you’ve ever noticed Embankment station’s announcement is different to the rest, well there’s a reason – as a viral Twitter thread recently retoldIf you happen to find yourself at Embankment station on the London Underground, pay particular attention to the tannoy: the station’s “Mind the Gap” announcement is pronounced in rich, theatrical tones, a voice you won’t hear elsewhere on the network.The reason for that is touching – a story of love and loss that went viral recently when it was retold in a Twitter thread by John Bull, AKA @garius, erstwhile contributor to this site and editor of the London Reconnections blog that covers transport in impressively entertaining detail, and is well worth following if you’re a fan of the kind of stories we tell at  Cities.Bull writes: “Just before Christmas 2012, staff at Embankment Tube station were approached by a woman who was very upset. She kept asking them where the voice had gone. They weren’t sure what she meant. The Voice? The voice, she said. The man who says ‘Mind the Gap’.”Staff reassured her that the announcement had simply been updated with a new digital system and new voices.“That voice,” she explained, “was my husband.”Sure enough, the voice belonged to Oswald Laurence, a Rada graduate and theatre actor who died in 2007. The recording dates back more than 45 years – and at one point could be heard along the length of the northbound Northern line before eventually being phased out – except at Embankment.In her grief, his devastated widow, Margaret McCollum, took comfort in travelling via the station and listening to her beloved husband’s voice.Distressed by the fact she could no longer listen to Oswald’s voice, she asked Transport for London if she could get a copy of the recording. Staff managed to track it down and worked to restore the announcement at Embankment station.“And that is why today, even in 2019, if you go down to Embankment station in London, and sit on the northbound platform on Northern Line, you will here a COMPLETELY different voice say Mind the Gap to ANYWHERE else on the Underground. It’s Oswald,” says Bull.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab98caf91b4c467f1cc25749cf16bd92f860bd44/0_103_3374_2025/master/3374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59575dd58bf35cfb6262e9fba3a7742e","title":"2010s tech giants google amazon facebook regulators","story":"The 2010s will be remembered for a new era in the development of capitalism, one of mind-boggling scale. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are closing the decade as the world’s first trillion-dollar companies. Last year, Apple’s revenue was larger than Vietnam’s GDP, while Amazon’s research and development spending alone is almost as much as Iceland’s GDP. Facebook boasts 2.4 billion users, a population larger than that of every continent except Asia.Big tech may offer much to us as consumers but, as the decade progressed, it became clear that it presents a problem for us as citizens who want elections that adhere to advertising laws and are free from foreign interference. It’s also a problem for people who want to live in towns with functioning retail high streets, where Amazon’s ruthless margin-squeezing means poorly paid, zero-hour gigs in logistics and delivery are the norm. And it’s a problem for us as democrats who depend on independent news media to hold our elected representatives to account.The decade gave us new concepts to account for all this: the political economist Nick Srnicek talks of “platform capitalism”, a business model of creating market trading platforms, extracting vast amounts of data and seeking monopoly. Prof Shoshana Zuboff dubbed this “surveillance capitalism”, warning of the risks that data poses to democracy and freedom.Let’s look back at the headlines in 2010. Facebook was under attack for exposing information that users assumed was private Google exited China after cyberattacks aimed at human rights activists Apple had a huge US iPad data breach and there was an “epidemic” of worker suicides at Chinese factories run by Foxconn, which makes Apple products. Amazon meanwhile was found to be selling a paedophile advice guide – and was locked in argument with publishers over ebook royalties.Researchers at the time warned that something was rotten in the state of California, too. “Cyberlaw” scholars Lawrence Lessig and Jonathan Zittrain argued that we must grapple with who would govern cyberspace and how. Prof Siva Vaidhyanathan feared “the Googlization of everything” and Evgeny Morozov railed against “the net delusion” – the naive notion that the internet would liberate the world. During Facebook’s 2012 IPO, Mark Zuckerberg wrote: “We hope to change how people relate to their governments and social institutions.” He should have been more careful what he wished for.But if the problems were so evident so early, why didn’t governments rein the industry in?Big tech moved at a scale and speed that states and regulators couldn’t match. As marketplaces, they benefit from “network effects”, where each additional user improves the utility of a service, producing a positive feedback loop of growth. Running costs barely change as more people join. This has allowed their rise to surpass those of other boom industries in the past, from automobiles to oil: one additional car on the roads, for instance, causes more congestion. In the first half of the 2010s, financial crisis was spreading from the US to the eurozone and political energies were directed away from the tech industry. There was a skills gap – career politicians and their advisers lacked expertise to even identify the problems, let alone design fixes. But more than this, governments didn’t want to rein tech firms in. They were an engine of growth in an otherwise sclerotic economy. And Barack Obama thought that social media and micro-targeted digital communications had helped him win the 2012 election. (Then Trump thought much the same.) There was no political will for change.There is finally momentum growing around regulation: in 2018, GDPR made legislative ground for user data protection and privacy, and ongoing EU antitrust rulings are chipping away at monopolistic excesses. Increasing tech employee activism provides a kind of internal regulation, too. The next decade will also see more competition from Chinese firms such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu – though this is just more platform capitalism wearing a different hat.Are alternatives possible? I would like to be more confident than I am. This decade has seen decentralised social networks such as Mastodon, Gab, Diaspora and the dark web either sputter out or, in the absence of moderators, fill instead with Nazis and paedophiles. Every so often there’s a call for a publicly funded state social media platform – but, with Boris Johnson gunning for the BBC licence fee in the UK, this is but a pipedream.In the US and UK, with rightwing populists in power, greater state regulation may not go exactly as tech commentators of the early 2010s hoped. There are fundamental tensions in what we are asking of Facebook, Google and Twitter. We fear how far they shape and control the information billions see – but, in seeking action on abusive content and misinformation, we ask that they exert yet more control, not less.The social media era is already waning: we’re shifting away from public posting towards private and small group messaging. I expect to see tech companies getting better at the small design decisions that discourage hostile digital behaviour – though I hold little hope for decisive action on the big issues of antitrust or curtailing data collection. The tech headlines of 2019 – “Facebook revenues soar despite $5.1bn in fines”, “Google hit with ‘historic’ monopoly abuse investigation” – may well predict the state of things in 2029.• Jay Owens is a researcher and writer interested in media, technology and modernity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9406f516ee0913b6591b2b4518cb9a34cad5908b/362_677_1699_1019/master/1699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9f3014fdf511d853ebc36ad1b5289c","title":"60th birthday old age","story":"Having been denied all birthday celebrations until I left home at 16, I was always determined to mark subsequent birthdays well. I’d go to bed the night before in a juvenile state of anticipation and wake up ecstatic that I had survived another year, that I had proved them wrong and outrun the apocalypse. You see, I was brought up as a Jehovah’s Witness and believed I would die in 1976 when Armageddon came. I would never reach 30, 40 or 50 so I thought. So each birthday has been a shaken fist at the heavens well as a celebration.My 21st lasted three days: drink, drugs, dance and a very long sleep. I came to and felt I’d finally put the cruel denials to bed and maybe that a three-day party would last me a lifetime. But I had a party for my 30th, 40th and 50th. OK, not three days long but a bit of a bash that welcomed in the next decade. So far, so good. And next year I will be 60. I thought the prospect would feel the same. That I would sashay up to the date, throw my arms out and say “welcome” as I had to all the others. But this one feels different.I’ve been getting away with the term “middle age” since I turned 40. I assumed it started around then and ended at 55. Then I got to 55. I extended it, obviously. But it has to end. Next year, I can’t be middle aged any more. I must officially be old.I think of the other 60-year-olds I have known. My mother – worn down by housework and an unhappy marriage, frightened into righteousness by an oppressive religion – was definitely old at 60 and my father was dead at 68. Aunts and uncles and teachers and people I worked for were impossibly ancient at 60, they dressed in beige and had Velcro shoes and all seemed to smell of Vicks VapoRub. I know I will never be like that. But as it gets nearer I realise I will be entering into another realm, old age, the other tick box that is 59-plus. There’s never anything after 59, you are lumped in with the 70- and 80-year-olds as though we all think the same despite a possible 30-year age gap between us.At 60 I will be sent (my older sister assures me) a free bowel cancer check kit complete with a mini scoop to stick in your shit and send off in the post. I will get free prescriptions and eye tests. I think I get reduced admission to my local gym and a rail travel discount card. So even if you are unwilling to accept 60 and bury your head in the sand even if, like me, you are determined to see it as just another number, the world conspires to tell you that things have changed. And at least for me, they have.My 50s have been wonderful. I’ve become single and have had some great dates. I’m open to a new relationship, to flirting, to being wanted and sexual and expansive. I’ve found professional success writing books and essays, editing, teaching and encouraging other writers. I have used my voice to say what I think on behalf of working-class writers and marginalised people, and I’ve discovered in the Fuck-it Fifties that I truly do love myself with no apology or codicil. I have stopped looking for universal approval, worrying about fitting in and whether or not I wear, eat, read or say the right thing. But all that has come at a cost. I’ve been told I appear self-contained and intimidating, “fierce” is a word often used to describe me, all of which I find baffling.Far from being just another decade, I think 60 might be a turning point. Yes, I will flip from middle age to old age, but I may also flip from the Fuck-it Fifties to the Savour-it Sixties. Will I slow down? Will I soften round the edges? I have noticed I am already consolidating important friendships and sloughing off those that have become negative or “taking”, which is the only word I can think of to describe them. I hope to always be making new friends, and in my 60s there may be more time for that.There is, of course, the inevitable express train of time, hurtling away from you as you age. As 60 approaches, I do have the sense of time running out, or at the very least becoming more precious, which is the most cliched of all cliches but nevertheless true. I thought coming up to 60 would feel like just another birthday, but as it approaches I realise I was wrong. It does feel like something is about to end, and so, of course, something is about to begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95fdf64300c1f0c4ba346089d1b2b819c7cfe9c/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6096a045fb1478db0acd94a7ed48468","title":"new little women greta gerwig inspirational","story":"My sister-in-law confesses that she is nervous about the Greta Gerwig adaptation of Little Women, in cinemas from Boxing Day. In her family of women, the 1994 film starring Winona Ryder is a Christmas tradition another version will, she fears, inevitably disappoint. Having just seen the new film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen as the sisters Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March, I assured her there was nothing to worry about. The rave reviews are pouring in, and to the universal acclaim I can add my own: this clever, spirited, witty adaptation is pure pleasure from start to finish. Furthermore, it serves as a timely reminder of just how feminist the original novel, published in two parts in 1868 and 1869, was.“When I read it at 30 I couldn’t believe it, I felt like I’d never read it before,” Gerwig told the New Yorker. “I couldn’t believe how modern it was, how strange it was, how spiky it was. I’d allowed it to become this snowglobe of sweetness, and it was nothing like that. It was much more complicated.”Lines that Gerwig has used from the original novel include the girls’ mother Marmee’s “I’m angry almost every day of my life” (of course she was, Gerwig has noted: she was a woman in the 19th century) and aspiring painter Amy’s insistence: “I want to be great or nothing.” Little Women is, essentially, a story about raising intelligent, ambitious, creative girls at a time when society consistently undervalued them, a fact to which the title specifically alludes. Heroine Jo desperately wants to be a writer but is under pressure to marry and improve her family’s fortunes. “Women have minds and souls as well as hearts, ambition and talent as well as just beauty, and I’m sick of being told that love is all a woman is fit for,” Jo says in the film.It is ironic, then, that despite having produced one of the best films of the year, Gerwig has been snubbed for her efforts, dismaying many film critics. She was not nominated for a Golden Globe in the best director category, which this year, yet again, features only men. Nor was she shortlisted for best screenplay, despite having intelligently rewritten the story as a non-chronological dual narrative that switches between the sisters’ girlhoods and womanhoods, before she introduces a third narrative strain that erodes the boundaries between fact and fiction while commenting shrewdly on itself.Look away if you don’t want spoilers, but Gerwig gives Jo a book. Alcott’s novel ends with Jo, having got married and become a mother, giving up writing and founding a school. In real life, Alcott became a famous author, writing later of her heroine Jo that “she should have become a literary spinster”. Gerwig blended the two narratives to create a sort of meta-fiction, gifting Alcott’s heroine the ending that she – and perhaps Alcott – were both prevented from writing (in the film, Jo is told by her publisher, in a guise that could equally be that of a Hollywood mogul, that “if the main character’s a girl make sure she’s married by the end”).Perhaps it is Gerwig’s affinity with the March sisters, via the struggle to be a woman artist, that makes her adaptation of Little Women so good. Gerwig’s partner, Noah Baumbach, is also a director, and although their work together has involved collaboration and Baumbach has been vocal about her influence on his work, she has been consistently cast as his muse. Furthermore, Little Women gets to the heart of which stories continue to be perceived as important and worthy of intellectual inquiry and interpretation. This is why I sense that Gerwig may have anticipated the snub, and may even have baked its underpinnings into the text of the film. “It’s just about our little life,” says Jo, of the new writing she is producing. “Who will be interested in a story of domestic struggles and joys? It doesn’t have any real importance.”“Maybe,” says her sister Amy, “We don’t see these things as important because people don’t write about them.”We have come some way to reconciling the domestic when it comes to artistic and literary output, of accepting that stories in such a setting are human stories worthy of being told, even if the protagonists are female. (Because, while women are constantly required to imagine themselves from the viewpoint of a male character, men are rarely expected to surrender the default, and even when they are encouraged to do so will often be resistant.) We have writers such as Elena Ferrante to thank for this ever-increasing acceptance, though we must remember those who dispiritingly insisted that this anonymous author of world-class skill must be a man masquerading as a woman.Women’s stories continue to be written off, to be denied the status of high art. Gerwig knows it, just as any woman who writes novels, or makes art or directs films knows it. Like Jo, you have to fight hard for recognition. I have no doubt that many men will refuse to go and see this film, but those who do, or who are press-ganged into it by excited daughters, will find it brimming with humanity. It is hard not to be moved by the “little women’s” ongoing struggle to be included in that category, or by the thought of all the little girls who will see it, this book I have loved since I was six and which has been reinvented for a new generation, that tells them: “What you want is valid and important.”I don’t know when my sister-in-law will get a chance now: she has just given birth to a daughter. No doubt one day they will watch it together, and it will show her that her dreams and ambitions can be greater and more soaring than Louisa May Alcott, trapped in the 19th century and kicking against it, could ever have hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2103e0a89a11505caddbbc99e26337ad68419a3/0_0_5770_3464/master/5770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f407ec402370307b7974dfa8dfbd37","title":"the guardian view on the rise of christian nativist populists a troubling sign of things to come","story":"It has therefore, for many Christians, been depressing to witness the faith of their churches being used to justify the abandonment of such principles in Europe, Donald Trump’s America and beyond. For liberally minded Christians, 2019 was the latest in a succession of anni horribili, during which a cultural appropriation of their religion did service for aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, homophobia and anti-environmentalism.In Poland, the Law and Justice party was re-elected, with the enthusiastic backing of the country’s Catholic establishment. It made the demonisation of LGBT people a key part of the autumn election campaign. In doing so it received the active assistance of the archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski, who warned voters that a “rainbow plague” had replaced the “red plague” which blighted the country in the communist era. The country also stands accused of breaking European Union law by refusing to comply with a refugee quota programme, instituted in 2015.A question of faithHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has forsaken talk of illiberal democracy and now speaks of “Christian liberty”. Mr Orbán’s ambition appears to be to turn Budapest into the capital of rightwing Christian thought, an arch-conservative counterpoint to Pope Francis’s Vatican. Last month, at a conference convened in the Hungarian capital to highlight the persecution of Christians in places such as Iraq, Syria and Nigeria, Mr Orbán repeated his argument that Christian culture was under threat from Muslim migration, and warned that the persecution of Christians in Europe was “much closer” than generally understood. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organisation, has accused Mr Orbán of systematically denying food to failed asylum seekers held in detention camps on Hungary’s border – an action it described as “an unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe.” He has also made homelessness a criminal offence.Mr Orbán discovered a religious side in his 30s, as the political party he led, Fidesz, moved to the right. In Italy, the leader of the League party, Matteo Salvini, uses Christianity to pursue culture wars relating to migration and national identity. When Mr Salvini, as minister of the interior in Italy’s previous government, proposed in 2018 that crucifixes should be displayed in all Italian public spaces, including ports he had closed to vessels carrying rescued migrants, he was reprimanded by a close adviser of Pope Francis. The Rev Antonio Spadaro tweeted: “The cross is a sign of protest against sin, violence, injustice and death. It is NEVER a sign of identity. It screams of love to the enemy and unconditional welcome.” But Mr Salvini has since doubled down on his politicisation of Catholic symbols, claiming he is “the last of the good Christians”. Support for him among practising Catholics is high.The battle to defend the rights and human dignity of all, irrespective of gender, race or sexuality, is having to be fought all over again. But the theological roots of that liberal vision in a Pauline notion of universality – “all are one in Christ” – is rarely examined by progressives. In an era when Christian ethics are being so brazenly twisted to serve nativism and attacks on minorities, that could be a mistake. Happily, there are signs that this may change in 2020. Some of the Democrat candidates in next year’s US presidential race are wearing their faith on their sleeve to an unusual extent.Straws in the wind? For both secular liberals and Christians, there are lessons to be drawn from what might be seen as a prophetic alliance between Pope Francis and Greta Thunberg on the most urgent issue facing the world: the climate emergency. When Time magazine made Ms Thunberg its person of the year, the Vatican was quick to celebrate her as “a witness to what the church teaches on the care of the environment and the care of the person”.The pope has identified the protection of the Amazon rainforest, where this year the greatest levels of deforestation for a decade were recorded, as an environmental priority. But the culture wars being fought in the public square – which have seen Ms Thunberg become a target – are also being played out within the Christian churches. A three-week Rome synod on the Amazon in October was overshadowed by conservative criticism of the Pope’s decision to invite native peoples and welcome their religious symbols. Liberal democracies rightly prize the separation of church and state which emerged following the Enlightenment. But as the reactionary right denigrates ideas of human dignity and equality that can be traced back to the first formulations of early Christianity, liberals of goodwill need to unite across the religioussecular ide in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef958be65e839c917039925b0ed8680e34e4b051/979_620_4148_2489/master/4148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb9a599ae4b626661f0c3c6072dc69fc","title":"if i have no hope for the planet why am i so determined to have this baby","story":"I wonder if my child will ever have the innocence I had two months ago, of not having to think about whether the air will kill youSitting, nauseous with morning sickness, on a park bench in the bright heat of an unusually hot spring day my partner and I watch children march past us, striking from school:“What’s the point of an education if we have no future,” their signs say.My heart relocates itself, sinking down somewhere around my ankles. They have 10 more years of habitable planet than the baby I am carrying.In early summer of the same year, after a miscarriage, I find myself pregnant again in the week that megafires tear through the state. There are 70-metre flames producing their own weather systems, driving them further on across the countryside, through the bushland that relies on fire to stimulate new life, on to forests that have never before burnt.The sky over our Canberra home is tinged orange, the air is thick and sticks in the back of your throat in such a way that no coughing seems to dislodge the sensation. The whole country is suffocating. We haven’t seen the sky in a month.Outside, the particle count is only 200 PM2.5 today. Yesterday it was 700, more than double the highest warning of “hazardous”. Two months ago we’d never looked at fine particle readings. We didn’t know the difference between a 10-micrometre particle that can be filtered out by your respiratory system, and one smaller than 2.5 micrometres, that will find its way right into your bloodstream.I wonder if my child will ever have the innocence I had two months ago, of not having to think about whether the air will kill you.Locked in my house, waiting for a high-grade pollution mask to arrive by post, I press my nose up against the glass doors, looking at where my front fence should be. “So this is what it’s like to have a baby at the end of the world.”There’s always a leap of faith in choosing to have a child. Will they be healthy? Can you provide for them? Will you be a good parent? Will you even know how to be a parent? We have to suspend our own disbelief in ourselves. We Can Do This. I Can Do This.There are times in history where that leap has been more existential.I can only imagine that women anxiously questioned “What world will be left for my child?” during the cold war. During epidemics. During genocide. And I presume they continued because, despite the terror, they still had hope. Hope that the atrocities of humanity, the threat of disease, would quiet. Hope that their child would be one of the lucky ones.How different is this existential leap to the one women must take now? To quiet their minds as the world burns? In some ways the threat is both more abstract and more overwhelming.War is an immediate threat to life. But war can stop as abruptly as it starts.Climate collapse is less immediate – there is, at least presently and for most of us, no imminent loss of life. But, unlike war, it cannot be stopped. Perhaps it can be slowed. Maybe a little of the damage already done could be mitigated. But as my climate researcher friend explained to me this year: “There’s an analogy we use to explain climate change to students. We say: it’s like traffic. You’re not in traffic, you are traffic.”I lost two babies in 2019. With each loss, I both grieved and felt something lift from my chest. “What is that lifting?” I searched. “Why is there the smallest touch of relief each time this happens?” I dug.Guilt was the answer. It was guilt sitting on my chest while I was pregnant, that sits there now while I write – pregnant again.Guilt for creating another human that has to live on this planet. Guilt for my unborn child that they will not live the kind of comfortable life that I have. That the things that we know we can pass on to protect our children from suffering, that previous generations have sought to pass on, will do little. Education, wisdom, wealth are useless when there is no air.When I expressed this guilt, or rather its dispersion, after I lost babies friends would say, “Don’t feel climate guilt. We need a smart, informed generation if we’re going to get out of this.” Or, “It’s kids like yours, like mine, that are going to change things.” In these comments I see the hope they are reaching for, the way they quiet their mind when they worry “what world will be left for my child?” as countless women before them have.I envy them that hope. Maybe, it will become the straw I too cling to when I finally do bring a child into this world. I nod as they talk – perhaps more to themselves than to me – and stop words leaving my lips: “Thinking your child will be part of the solution, not the problem, is hubris.” We are the collapse. Our children are the collapse.Why, you might ask, if I think “my child could be part of the solution” is merely self-soothing hubris, do I keep getting pregnant? Why if I have no hope like my friends am I so determined that I’ve now become pregnant for the third time in a year?There are two answers to this. One is that I hope the hope will come.The other is that in choosing between the sadness of living a childfree existence because I do not believe the Earth can survive us, and the sadness of having a child whose future may be limited – I choose the latter. When I weigh them up, hold each in my mind and my hands and see which is heavier, I decide time and again that the latter is a sadness I can more easily carry.I think of my child, of the relationship I will have with them and the world we will live in, like the time my mother was terminally ill.When my mother had cancer there was 12 months between her diagnosis and her death. I knew she would die. But knowing that didn’t mean I didn’t spend time with her. Didn’t laugh with her. Find joy and beauty in our relationship. Enjoy the experiences we could have, while we had time. And so it is, we must reach for the pieces of beauty the world still offers us. The clear blue sky when we have it. A child watching a bee feeding in the garden. The sounds of a flock of native birds passing overhead. We, my child-to-be and I, will visit the world on its deathbed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c5615e586cce2e57261bfb812da7b7980ab4abc/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f28fc8fc991fb6e374f1066bdc2f62d","title":"ben jennings christmas yet to come cartoon","story":"The 2019  and Observer appeal is supporting four charities that help to slow down the damage from the climate crisis.

By 2025 there will be more than 330, based on an analysis of company announcements.New European Union rules come into force on 1 January that will heavily penalise carmakers if average carbon dioxide emissions from the cars they sell rise above 95g per kilometre. If carmakers exceed that limit, they will have to pay a fine of €95 (£79) for every gram over the target, multiplied by the total number of cars they sell.The excess emissions bill would have been £28.6bn on 2018 sales figures, according to analysis by the automotive consultancy Jato Dynamics, illustrating the extent of the change required by carmakers over a short period of time. Jato analyst Felipe Muñoz said there will still be large fines, as companies keep selling profitable internal combustion engine cars and struggle to bring down EV prices to parity with their fossil-fuel peers.“It is very difficult for carmakers to change manufacturing infrastructure in such a short period of time,” Muñoz said.However, some analysts take a more sceptical view of the industry that spawned the Dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen and Daimler were shown to have deliberately cheated emissions regulations. Carmakers successfully lobbied for a rule that means cars emitting less than 50g of carbon dioxide per kilometre are eligible for so-called super-credits, a controversial policy which means that every electric vehicle sold counts as two cars. That makes it easier for carmakers to meet their targets, even if average emissions from their cars are actually higher than the rules stipulate.Multiple new electric car models will go on sale just in time to qualify for EU regulations. In November the first of Volkswagen’s ID.3 cars rolled off a new electric production line in Zwickau, eastern Germany, that will be able to produce 330,000 vehicles a year by 2021. The first of BMW’s Mini Electric models, made in Oxford, will arrive in showrooms in March. Vauxhall, owned by France’s PSA Group, will start production of its Corsa-e in January, with sales to begin in March.Sales of pure electric vehicles will still be dwarfed by those of cars with conventional fossil-fuel engines, as well as hybrids that use both battery and internal combustion power. However, the electric vehicle surge is likely to contribute to significant price reductions, as carmakers compete for buyers beyond the early adopters willing to pay a premium.Consultants at Deloitte estimate the market will reach a tipping point in 2022, when the cost of ownership of an electric car is on par with its internal combustion engine counterparts. Separate research by the International Council on Clean Transportation suggested this was already the case in February in five European countries, including the UK.In the UK, some drivers anxious about the short range of electric vehicles on a single charge will be put off from buying them until the development of charging infrastructure spreads across the country. However, scandals such as Dieselgate have made investors “acutely aware” of the need to increase electric sales and comply with emissions regulations, according to Arlene Ewing, a director at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.“Brand is all to a carmaker and failure to meet the deadline may adversely affect their brand, reputation and, ultimately, sales,” she said. “We have seen this before. Consumers tend to be brand loyal.”Rising demand from consumers has also filtered through to used electric cars: listings website CarGurus found that second-hand prices of some models had risen during 2019. Tom Leathes, the chief executive of rival car sales platform Motorway, said the market was growing “extremely fast”, despite the complications of selling cars that include separately leased batteries.“We expect this segment to grow year on year for at least another 10 years as electric’s share of the new car market continues to grow exponentially,” Leathes said.Volkswagen ID.3Price: under £26,000, range: 205 miles, due in early 2020The “third-generation” mass-market vehicle from the world’s largest carmaker will be swiftly followed by the ID.4 SUV, on the same electric vehicles platform, and production will be carbon neutral, VW claims.Vauxhall Corsa-ePrice: £26,490, range: 209 miles, due in April 2020Along with the Mini, the Corsa is one of the first of the UK’s perennial bestsellers to get an electric makeover. It shares its core parts with Peugeot’s e-208, another of the PSA Group’s key superminis.Tesla Model YPrice: about £30,300, range: 230 miles, production to start in summer 2020The latest model from the company that kicked off the electric car race will be the Model Y, a compact SUV that can fit seven people.

Such is the damning verdict of shoreline anglers on a species that has been thriving for 450 million years. After winter storms they are often seen stranded on beaches but otherwise in summer are found by delighted children in rock pools around British coasts. Also known as sea stars because of their five arms, specimens are usually orange or brown and grow to 10 to 30cm (11.8 inches) across, although sometimes larger depending on the food supply.They are strange creatures, spiny on top and able to move around on small bumpy tubes on their underside. They have cells that “smell” prey and detect light. Chop them up and each piece will regrow into new starfish provided a part of the central core remains in each piece. But perhaps their most remarkable feature is the ability to turn their stomachs inside out through the mouth to absorb prey and then suck the stomach back into the body. Starfish eat almost anything they find on the sea floor but use their arms to prise open mussels and clams to consume them. Large numbers can cause commercial shellfish farms serious losses but starfish are otherwise harmless and provide food for seabirds.

Thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it seems post–Christmas sales no longer hold the sense of anticipation they once did with many shoppers choosing to eschew them altogether.When it comes to fashion many are turning to buying secondhand – where lower prices come with the added benefit of reduced impact on the environment.“There are signs of an emerging fatigue about frenzied mass consumerism and its impact on the planet,” says Nina Marston, the beauty and fashion analyst at Euromonitor International.This is backed up by research from the retail analyst Edited, whose “Black Friday and Cyber Monday postmortem” report stated that “growing environmental concerns paired with more frequent promotional strategies has resulted in discounting fatigue from consumers, leading to retailers that opt out of running sales”.There will, of course, still be plenty of sales in the run-up to the new year and beyond – and while impulse buys and clothes bought to be worn once are now decidedly unchic, investment purchases at a reduced price still hold appeal.Here are five pieces which will help you make a stylish, and eco-friendly, start to the new year and beyond.The sale might be dead but the bralet most certainly isn’t. Bralets were worn under summer jackets on SS20 catwalks, including Anna Sui, and loosely layered over strappy tops at Vera Wang, making it one of the most versatile items you can pick up in the sales. Asos and Topshop have numerous longline styles designed to be worn as standalone pieces, but for those who’ve been eyeing up Savage x Fenty since September, bralets worn as underwear one day, outerwear the next, are value for money.Shiny dresses in gold, silver and primary colours are a Christmas party staple – and now, you guessed it, they’re heading straight for the sale rails. Good news, however: a quick glance at springsummer collections from Balenciaga, Halpern, Versace and others suggests that, this year, the metallic look is here to stay. On the high street, Zara has opted for a host of metallic mini, midi and ankle-grazing gowns.Microbags, though big on Instagram and the red carpet, were always daft, being unable to accommodate more than a lip balm. In any case, this season big bags are set for a comeback. Of course, being entirely more practical, big bags never really went away – look out for supersized crochet carriers, as seen at Off White, or giant bucket bags like those at Marni.Recently announced as Pantone’s colour of the year, classic blue is set to be big next season. When shopping the sales, avoid last summer’s prairie pastels and instead opt for the kind of heavy, solid hues seen on suits at Balmain and jackets at Fila, \u0026amp Other Stories has everything from dresses to jumpers in the shade.Hacking the high street doesn’t get simpler than coords (coordinates), especially when many stores sell – and discount – different items with the same pattern, print, or material. Labels including Palm Angels, Dries Van Noten and Sacai all opted for coords on the catwalk, with the matchy-matchy look crossing both mens and womenswear (ideal if you shop for a shared wardrobe). River Island and Nobody’s Child are your best bets for matching sets in the sales and, of course, you can always mix it up to get more bang for your buck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f18992b804ccbf3ff1eece67b14a9c54059b1aeb/0_56_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=120cff13574f0c89c578c4ef7022b993","title":"the most exciting movies of 2020 family films","story":"Mulan fights her way out of controversy, Pixar jams with a jazz Coco and Keanu Reeves stars opposite SpongeBob Squarepants in next year’s most promising kids’ flicksWe had a pretty good version of Roald Dahl’s The Witches in 1990, but that was a whole generation ago.

The way Ramsey was allowed to leave last summer rankles among Arsenal fans but he eclipses Laurent Koscielny as the club’s best performer of the decade. Paul ChronnellThe goalkeeper was likened to Superman by Gordon Strachan after a superlative performance for Blackburn and he continued to avoid kryptonite after moving to Villa in 2008. Friedel proved to be a rock-like presence behind Martin O’Neill’s defence and while he only played one year for Villa this decade – he joined Tottenham in June 2011 – his service was immense. In a game at Manchester United in February 2011, Friedel also became the club’s oldest player at the age of 39 years and 259 days. Ian MalinPerhaps the best £170,000 Bournemouth have ever spent. The defender has racked up more than 300 appearances since turning a loan deal from Brighton into a permanent move seven years ago, when the club were 10th in League One. Cook, who cut his teeth in non-league football, has been the epitome of consistency and a cornerstone of Bournemouth’s extraordinary rise to the Premier League under Eddie Howe. Ben FisherA difficult decision but, in the end, Dunk gets the nods over Bruno. As the song says, the 28-year-old defender has been with Brighton from Withdean to Wembley having been born in the town, attended secondary school there and spent his youth career at the club, signing his first professional contract with Brighton in 2010. Dunk, named captain by current manager Graham Potter, is fearless, great in the air and even chips in with a few goals – in 2014-15 he was Brighton’s top scorer. Stephanie FinchamBarnes has come to epitomise Burnley in his seven seasons at Turf Moor. The 30-year-old striker has played in all five Premier League campaigns under Sean Dyche, growing in stature and scoring more often with each one. The former west country journeyman is now an established top-flight performer and while his style might not be the prettiest, he, like the club itself, is persistent, effective and awkward to play against. Paul WilsonForget about the last decade, the Belgian is one of the greatest players ever seen at Stamford Bridge. His creative genius brought him plenty of inidual accolades during his seven years in England and he proved an inspirational figure during Chelsea’s title triumphs of 2015 and 2017, under José Mourinho and Antonio Conte respectively. No doubt, Premier League defenders were relieved when Hazard left last summer to join Real Madrid. Jacob SteinbergOnly Julian Speroni even comes close to matching the impact of the player who grew up a stone’s throw from Selhurst Park. Having made his debut for Palace in March 2010, Zaha has racked up almost 300 appearances for the club – having briefly flown the nest to Manchester United as Sir Alex Ferguson’s last signing there – and without him the south Londoners would never have played a record seven straight top-flight campaigns. Ed AaronsA £60,000 purchase from Sligo Rovers in January 2009 and Everton and Republic of Ireland captain today. A humble, dignified and proud figure who developed into one of the finest full-backs in the Premier League over the course of the decade (Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka have played more matches for Everton than Coleman but were already regulars before his arrival) and he epitomises the kind of spirit, and signing, the club desperately need to find again. Andy HunterFrom a goalscoring debut against Torquay United to match-winning performances in the Premier League and Champions League, Vardy has done it all with Leicester, mostly with a lovable snarl. The striker could have followed Riyad Mahrez and N’Golo Kanté out the door after spearheading the title triumph in 2016 but he stayed and is now leading another charge for glory. Leicester fans love him, England fans miss him, and Premier League defenders will have a party when Vardy retires. Paul DoyleA troubling figure, and not a member of Jürgen Klopp’s golden generation, but no player lit up Liverpool this decade quite like Suárez. There were the moments – the shot against Arsenal, the goal against Newcastle, the goals against Norwich – as well as the relentless work-rate and desire, all of which combined in the 2013-14 season as the Uruguayan led Brendan Rodgers’s men on their thrilling and ultimately doomed title charge. The most talented player in Liverpool’s history? Quite possibly. Sachin NakraniThe Spaniard will depart the Etihad Stadium next summer after a decade of midfield play that has been akin to Picasso in his cubist period: a one-off exhibition of unique artistry. Silva is peerless and has been fundamental to the success City have enjoyed during his time at the club, most notably their four Premier League titles. Now aged 33 it is no surprise Silva’s powers have been on the wane this season and, as a result, so too have City’s fortunes. Jamie JacksonDe Gea was United’s No 1 goalkeeper in their 2012-2013 title-winning campaign – the second and final occasion the club were crowned champions this decade – and in the seven years since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club the Spaniard has been the sole world-class presence at Old Trafford. In the fog of disarray that has so often occurred in front of him, De Gea has proven to be - the odd dip in form aside - a beacon of excellence. JJFor a time Tioté – who tragically died at the age of 30 following a cardiac arrest sufferered while training with Beijing Enterprises – was the most uncompromising holding midfielder in England. The Ivorian began his seven-year stint on Tyneside in 2010 and will always be remembered for his stunning 25-yard equalising volley in the 4-4 draw with Arsenal in February 2011. His midfield partnership with Yohan Cabaye was also integral to Newcastle’s fifth-place finish in 2011-12. Louise TaylorKnown to Norwich fans as ‘Wessi’, Hoolahan was an integral part of three promotions and four Premier League seasons. More importantly, he set the tone. Norwich have been up and down a lot during the past 10 years but they have settled on a style of play that values short passing, technique and brains above brawn. The diminutive Irishman embodied all of those qualities during his time at Carrow Road and earned a testimonial, too. Paul MacInnesSharp technically started the decade as a United player, albeit transfer listed and on loan at Doncaster as his second spell at the club fizzled out. He left. Again. He came back. Again. He made his third debut for the club in the 4-0 defeat at Gillingham with which United opened the 2015-16 League One season and two promotions and 90 goals later (for a club total of over 100), the 33-year-old striker is a bona fide Blades legend. John AshdownAfter five unforgettable years and 117 goals, Lambert left Southampton a hero. He initially joined the club in League One as a serial goalscorer with Bristol Rovers and fired them to the Championship and the Premier League, form which earned the striker a call-up to the England squad at the age of 31 and, in 2014, a move to boyhood club Liverpool, where things did not work out. Lambert retired two years ago after spells at West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City. Ben FisherKane brings the romance and the connection with the Tottenham fanbase he brings a work ethic that demands more of himself and those around him every day and, above all, he brings goals – over 170 of them since his debut for Spurs in August 2011, following a loan spell at Leyton Orient. Luka Modric and Gareth Bale were joys to watch for Spurs at the start of the decade but make no mistake – Kane is the symbol of the club. David HytnerThis has unquestionably been the Deeney decade. The forward has been at Watford for all but the first six months of it, and though initially underwhelming – his first season saw 17 league starts and just two goals – he has grown enormously as a player and as a person, with the team’s travails during his three-month injury absence this season demonstrating the captain’s continued importance as its spiritual figurehead. Simon BurntonIt ended in tears but there was nothing quite like it when Payet was in the mood. Signed for £10m from Marseille in June 2015, the Frenchman’s flicks, tricks and free-kicks were the undisputed highlight of West Ham’s final season at Upton Park. His skill was unrivalled and he managed an unforgettable solo goal against Middlesbrough before returning to Marseille in protracted manner in January 2017. JSNo player better embodies Wolves’s rise than the Irishman, who was not even a regular first-team player for Bohemians before joining the club for £80,000 in the summer of 2010. After a couple of loan stints, Doherty has soared to every challenge, progressing from League One through the Championship and into the Premier League and the Europa League, where the 27-year-old is now one of the best wing-backs in the business.

A navigation of the area of the Football Association’s website containing the reasons behind its disciplinary judgments in racism cases opens a window on to an unedifying world and is possibly best left to intrepid explorers.On second thoughts, perhaps everyone should make the journey. Maybe all fans need to study the arguments, sometimes complex, exposing the fine details behind Jonjo Shelvey’s five-game ban and £100,000 fine for racially abusing Romain Saïss of Wolves in 2016 and Sophie Jones’s similar suspension for making monkey noises at Renée Hector last spring.The time seems right to initiate a debate as to whether the FA’s burden of proof – currently the civil standard of “on balance of probabilities” rather than the criminal “beyond reasonable doubt” – remains appropriate.At a time when racism is on the rise the FA does much laudable work in increasing tolerance, with part of that role quite properly involving zero tolerance of abuse underscored by severe sanctions for offenders. It is imperative victims are taken seriously and justice is seen to be done.Yet in a highly sensitive sphere when the damaging repercussions for the guilty can be personally and professionally far-reaching and cases are often extremely confusing and contradictory, nagging fears about the present proof-level linger.With Shelvey and Jones adamant their convictions were wrongful, might the ruling body’s justice system gain greater credibility by adopting the hybrid “comfortable satisfaction of guilt” standard used by the court of arbitration for sport in doping cases?Angus Kinnear, Leeds United’s managing director, would prefer “beyond reasonable doubt”. His club’s goalkeeper, Kiko Casilla, is shortly scheduled to face an FA independent commission tasked with deciding whether to uphold the charge that he racially abused Charlton’s Jonathan Leko. Should the panel find him guilty of an offence Casilla denies, he can expect to be banned for between six and 12 matches, potentially jeopardising Leeds’s promotion hopes.“We fully support such a serious allegation being subjected to disciplinary process,” Kinnear says. “Our concern is that the burden of proof for an FA hearing is not ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’. We believe that, in cases of this seriousness, the higher standard of proof is more appropriate one man’s reputation is at stake.”He could have a point. Newcastle’s Shelvey was accused of calling Saïss – a French midfielder of Moroccan heritage – “an Arab or Moroccan prick or cunt”. Jones, a former Sheffield United Ladies striker, was said to have made monkey noises at the mixed-race Hector. In both instances the lack of corroborative evidence dictated that the Crown Prosecution Service would have been unlikely to consider initiating criminal proceedings.That does not necessarily mean the commission’s decisions were wrong but they look less than watertight. After repeatedly reading the written reasons it does not seem impossible Jones might have made spiteful, childish, non-monkey noises simply to mock Hector’s weight as she jumped for a header.Shelvey’s defence that he had instead, charmingly, called Saïss “a smelly breathed prick” seemed complicated by the non-English speaking Wolves midfielder having heard nothing. The complaint was made by opposition players who had earlier listened to Shelvey calling them peasants as he emphasised his significantly fatter wage packet by, in football’s vernacular, “cashing off”. “I didn’t say it but that stain will be always be there,” Shelvey has said. “I have to live with people calling me racist.”Jones has given up football and has been similarly critical. “It was a kangaroo court,” she said. “I have no confidence in the FA.”Admittedly kangaroo is a term the lawyers and former players and managers comprising the independent regulatory panels that assess evidence and hear witnesses cross-examined by the respective parties’ QC’s would balk at. Footballers-turned-lawyers Udo Onwere, Stuart Ripley and Gareth Farrelly often feature on experienced and erse three-person panels alongside former pros such as Marvin Robinson and Tony Agana. Female representatives include the barrister Arshia Hashmi.If Casilla could soon demand their attention, so too will Mark Sampson. Shortly after Stevenage’s first-team coach was promoted, temporarily, to caretaker manager in September the FA received a complaint from a newly sacked member of the ousted manager, Dino Maamria’s, staff. They alleged Sampson counselled against signing a defender because he was Nigerian. The former England women’s manager denies a resultant FA charge he maintains is malicious and was exonerated by Stevenage’s own investigation.Given Sampson’s past – namely, the discriminatory remarks he was found to have directed at Eni Aluko and Drew Spence – a guilty verdict could seriously harm his career. That places huge responsibility on a disciplinary panel, arguably increasing the case for adopting a Cas style hybrid as the required proof in FA racism cases.Advocates of “beyond reasonable doubt” should consider Fernando Forestieri’s alleged abuse of Krystian Pearce. In March the Sheffield Wednesday forward was found not guilty of racially harassing the Mansfield defender by a criminal court, but in July he received a guilty FA misconduct verdict and six-match ban.The ruling body justified this glaring ergence by citing the trial judge’s comment that a lack of supporting evidence meant he had to accept it was possible, although in his judgment, unlikely that Pearce misheard, thereby prefacing the not guilty verdict. In law, as in life, perfection is frequently elusive but “comfortable satisfaction of guilt” seems a pretty fair compromise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f88080f9d1df7d1e76f5c05bef7959de4ace63/0_96_2948_1769/master/2948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e42e216948e0feeddc54b66edaa32df8","title":"jurgen klopp focus liverpool momentum premier league","story":"With the world conquered, Liverpool’s thoughts return to scaling the peak that means the world to them. It is a measure of their unrivalled dominance and consistency in the Premier League this season that their position at the summit strengthened despite being more than 3,000 miles away in Qatar.Jürgen Klopp’s unbeaten leaders left England for the Club World Cup 10 points clear of Leicester, whom they visit today. They returned 10 points clear and with a game in hand on their nearest rivals after Brendan Rodgers’ team were beaten by Manchester City, whose challenge has not materialised so far. Liverpool also came back with the first world title in the club’s history – an achievement that proved beyond Bob Paisley’s team in 1981, Joe Fagan’s in 1984 and Rafael Benítez’s class of 2005 – and their third trophy inside seven months.The Club World Cup victory will generate momentum for the months ahead, claimed Andy Robertson. Roberto Firmino, required to give a rare interview after being named Fifa’s man of the match following the final he settled against Flamengo, warned: “In every match Liverpool are playing better.” The European champions appear to be growing stronger, too, despite concerns that fatigue might catch up eventually.While out in Doha Liverpool completed the signing of the Japan international Takumi Minamino, the gifted Red Bull Salzburg playmaker acquired for the bargain £7.25m release clause in a deal orchestrated by the sporting director, Michael Edwards. The 24-year-old, who officially becomes a Liverpool player on New Year’s Day, could feature in the FA Cup third-round derby against Everton on 5 January.In Qatar Naby Keïta continued his recent progression into the potent, creative and industrious midfielder that Liverpool have been waiting to witness regularly since his arrival in July 2018. Keïta’s opener against Monterrey was his third goal in three games and his penetrating runs into the box provided an alternative threat for a Liverpool team often reliant on the devastating power of their front three. Speaking of which, the return to form of Firmino and Mohamed Salah at the Club World Cup gave Klopp another reason to celebrate taking part. So, too, did Joe Gomez’s polished display in the final after a difficult start to the season for the young defender.It was a tournament that again left the Liverpool manager enraptured by the single-minded focus and desire of his players. There was little celebration beyond the changing room, from where the sound of “campiones, campiones, campiones” infiltrated the nearby media room.The team returned to the plush St Regis hotel for a meal in the early hours before retiring in advance of a flight home at noon. The Boxing Day trip to Leicester, and the opportunity to extend their lead to a remarkable 13 points before the halfway mark of the campaign was on Klopp’s mind before he left the Khalifa International Stadium with Liverpool’s latest trophy.From here it would take a monumental collapse for Liverpool not to add the Premier League title to world and European crowns. And a fade of that magnitude appears beyond them. Liverpool supporters have craved championship number 19 for almost 30 years and that exhausting wait, combined with painful memories of 2014’s dramatic slip, has fuelled a code of silence around what the spring of 2020 promises. But the omerta is as much under threat as Manchester City’s hopes of winning a hat-trick of Premier League titles. Sixteen victories from 17 league games so far, 26 from the last 27 stretching back to last season’s challenge, and 49 league games unbeaten at Anfield is a stunning return from a team who do not waver from their task.Klopp’s demand for complete focus on the next game is at the heart of Liverpool’s extraordinary consistency. It may be dull to hear the one-game-at-a-time cliche trotted out by the manager and repeated by his players but it works. The Club World Cup played out as everyone expected – and Fifa probably hoped – with the champions of Europe and South America in the final but there was no complacency inside the Liverpool camp.Firmino and Alisson, for example, were not asked for inside information on Flamengo until after Monterrey were overcome. Klopp watched Flamengo’s semi-final comeback against Al-Hilal at his hotel but again, only when Liverpool had booked their place in the final did he study four of the Brazilian club’s previous matches.Firmino’s stoppage-time winner against Monterrey was the sixth goal Liverpool have scored in the 90th minute or later this season (seven if his extra-time winner in the final is included). There is no danger of Liverpool’s relentlessness being taken for granted when their innate belief in victory, and the composure that remains in their game when trailing late at Aston Villa or falling behind in the first minute to Tottenham, are part of the team’s appeal. “Staying on track is part of our game,” as Klopp put it last week.Strength in depth told against Monterrey, as it has frequently this season, while the final lived up to its billing as the best Europe and South America have to offer. “Sensational” was how Klopp described the feeling of being the first Liverpool manager to win the Club World Cup. Becoming the first Liverpool manager to win the league in 30 years would feel even better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7827348185750aa3e30892b90b68ea9643d753cc/0_63_2083_1250/master/2083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69a91aee8b3c527253b02357b8b3b6fe","title":"liverpool barcelona tottenham ajax champions league","story":"No one gave Liverpool or Tottenham a chance of overhauling Barcelona and Ajax before a magical 24 hours of footballLiverpool v Barcelona at Anfield on Tuesday night. Ajax v Tottenham in Amsterdam on the Wednesday. I was there. Or at least, I think I was. There are newspaper cuttings that suggest this was the case, with words that sound familiar, if a little more fuzzy and overheated than usual.Those two days in early May still have a kind of fog about them even now. The Anfield game in particular feels like a moment of shared hysteria, the kind of game you watch through the prism of the crowd, the whole spectacle framed by their reactions.It’s no secret Anfield does this to people. Pep Guardiola calls it “that place”, and seems more spooked every time he goes back, a man who has talked himself into seeing ghosts. For all the myth-making, you have to admit he’s got a point.Perhaps there’s a science to it, the way the Anfield noise reverberates back across those tight single-tier stands. Perhaps it’s geography. Travel to Liverpool across the country and there is a feeling of the land falling away as you get closer, arriving at a kind of end point in that low grid of streets.Science, geography, whatever. The end result is the same – Anfield does weird things to people.The night before the Barcelona game had brought another note of drama, Vincent Kompany punting the ball past Kasper Schmeichel at the Etihad Stadium to give Manchester City a narrow but decisive-looking Premier League win.It didn’t seem to have affected the vibe around the ground. Quite the opposite. It still felt like the witching hour. Anfield was a beautiful tableau before kick-off: the red shirts, the deep green of the stage, the powder blue as the light faded above the lip of the stands.It is easy to forget Liverpool had a significantly weakened team, with no Mo Salah and no Roberto Firmino. The opening goal after seven minutes came at the end of a move involving Joël Matip, Jordan Henderson and Divock Origi who, for all their many qualities, are not players Spain’s elite clubs will have spent their pre-season anxiously studying. But how will we stop Matip? But they did for Barcelona all the same.A 1-0 half-time lead felt like a foothold. The game changed completely between 54 and 56 minutes, as Georginio Wijnaldum scored twice. The first was made by Trent Alexander-Arnold, and involved giving the ball away in midfield then simply smashing through Jordi Alba to get it back, before pinging a cross into the six-yard box. The second one was a power-header into the corner.At which point the night fell apart. People leapt and  around and tried to stand on things. The moon seemed to scroll backward through the sky. In the row of seats in front of me Jamie Carragher jumped around beating on the desks, combination-punching the air, hopping about like a seal chasing a beach ball. Which seemed like a fair point well made in the circumstances.The fourth goal, the clincher, contained acting. Liverpool had a corner kick down below where we were sitting. Alexander-Arnold walked away nonchalantly, shoulders drooped – hmmm, where am I going? – then ran back suddenly and smacked the ball into the path of Origi, the acting, really quite good acting, all part of the pass.I left Anfield around midnight, at which point it was clear football was going to fill the next 24 hours. In the lobby of my Manchester airport hotel everyone was still talking about football. A few short, adrenaline-churned hours later everyone at breakfast was talking about football. In departures and security everyone was talking about football. In Amsterdam the passport queue was full of Tottenham fans and various red-eyed media types, all on the same midweek weekender, all talking about football.It was a different feeling around the Johan Cruyff Arena. This is a huge concrete shell of a ground. If Anfield was warm and persuasive the Cruyff felt overwhelming. Ajax supporters had set up a noisy, slightly hostile fan park outside. There was a fug of sweet smoke and a drunken crush around the stairwells and stadium bars.Getting in was terrible. The admin system had crashed. No lunch, no water, four hours’ sleep: this felt like a day taking a wrong turn. Upstairs there was a further shemozzle over access. As the game kicked off, charged with filing 900 words on the final kick, I crammed myself into a concrete ledge without power or wifi right up in the gods, the players a set of moving shapes miles below.Spurs were already without Harry Kane. After four minutes they were 2-0 down on aggregate, Matthijs de Ligt heading in a corner. With 36 minutes gone it was 3-0, Hakim Ziyech smashing a shot into the corner. And at that moment this was pretty much over, a re-entry into the everyday after the wildness of Anfield. Ajax celebrated the moment, a team savouring the high. Spurs looked spent, cooked, done.Somehow they just kept coming. The first goal of the second-half comeback was a thing of beauty, a blitzkrieg down the centre launched by Danny Rose’s nutmeg and speared long pass. Dele Alli played a lovely touch to Lucas Moura, who scored. Four minutes later Moura did something brilliant with his feet in a tiny space in a crowded area. It was 3-2 and Spurs were playing through a kind of rage.Jan Vertonghen hit the bar with four minutes left and you could see the waves of fear rolling around the ground. Everyone knew what was coming. Into the 96th minute, Moura took a lovely, easy little flick from Alli and just tucked the ball into the corner with thrilling ease.At the final whistle the Spurs players didn’t really know what to do. They leapt and clutched each other. Mauricio Pochettino was suddenly there, punching the air with both fists. Anfield had felt like a universal effort, something the entire stadium dredged out of itself. This was more distinct, a display of will from the players that was easier to stand and admire, but no less moving for that.Barcelona had simply collapsed the night before. Ajax played their part in Amsterdam, a brilliantly constructed team reaching their own two-season high in that first half.The night ended in more confusion, with a struggle to escape the out-of-town megadrome. A mess of absent taxis was followed by a long walk into town and a slightly messy stroll through the canal bars of a city that wasn’t going to sleep.It is easy to become a little jaded by European club football, this Gazprom-fest, this endlessly excitable arm of Big Entertainment. But this was something else, a piece of extended sporting theatre that still feels a little raw and undigested, as though some small part of it will just keep on flickering away on an endless replay at the back of your head. Nothing quite this much fun has ever happened before in this competition. It may never happen again. Which is, all things considered, probably for the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718932d2f6caa2debb936805a4f41d83ef11e10d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce18b2dbfa39f0ba30d10e5268dbc74","title":"leeds west brom sheffield wednesday championship","story":"The top two are threatening to run away with automatic promotion but the race for the play-offs remains competitiveThreatening to runaway with things are West Brom and Leeds. This time last season nine points separated the top six but Slaven Bilic’s free-scoring Albion – only Manchester City have more league goals across England’s top five tiers – have established considerably more breathing space at the summit. Bilic has made his first taste of managing in the so-called madhouse look easy, so much so that his side have soared to the 50-point mark without appearing to work up too much of a sweat, and the sense is there is plenty of oomph to come.West Brom are eight points better off than they were last campaign while Leeds are only a point worse off. Not that they should be worried, with Ben White’s form in the ision’s best defence and the stealth of Kalvin Phillips major boons. Leeds could be forgiven for not getting too giddy – they imploded towards the end of last season and this month had to settle for a point after leading a 10-man Cardiff by three goals at Elland Road. Whether Marcelo Bielsa’s stubbornness over Eddie Nketiah comes back to bite remains to be seen the Arsenal striker is yet to start a league match since joining on loan in August.Beneath the top two things are splendidly congested between a flurry of teams with clear imperfections, with seven points separating third-placed Sheffield Wednesday and Queens Park Rangers in 14th. For Wednesday, who have made impressive strides since Garry Monk took charge in September, the elephant in the room is the EFL misconduct charge over the sale of Hillsborough, with their fate in the hands of an independent disciplinary commission. Fulham, propelled by the ision’s 17-goal leading scorer, Aleksandar Mitrovic, are fourth, level on points with a vibrant Preston, while a slick Brentford are primed for a tilt at the play-offs after tightening up at the back. Not so long ago Tony Mowbray was feeling the heat at Blackburn but they are one of the form teams and unbeaten in seven games.A youthful Swansea have blown hot and cold under Steve Cooper but remain in the mix, largely thanks to André Ayew. The Ghanaian is the club’s highest earner, taking home around £80,000 a week but the striker has proved a priceless commodity, hitting double figures in goals to keep them in the hunt. Across the Severn Bridge, Bristol City have wobbled in recent weeks and crave to add that kind of firepower in January. Sabri Lamouchi seemed to have sussed out how to return Nottingham Forest to the big time but a so-far dreadful December – played four, won none – has caused panic and they need to ease the goalscoring burden on Lewis Grabban. If Hull can repel interest and cling on to Jarrod Bowen – 51 goals in 118 league games, including 15 in 23 this season, is an extraordinary return for a right-winger – then they will fancy their chances, while Cardiff have been steady if unspectacular since Neil Harris took the reins, losing only once. Meanwhile 13th-placed Millwall, for whom Jed Wallace is enjoying a fine season, have benefited from an upturn in results since Gary Rowett replaced Harris they have lost two of Rowett’s 10 matches.It is increasingly hard to believe but the bottom club Stoke City have the most expensively assembled squad in the ision, weighing in at more than £140m, and another £50m-worth of talent out on loan. Back-to-back wins in Michael O’Neill’s first games in charge perhaps sugar-coated the size of the task, with Stoke taking a measly four points from the past available 18. Luton must shore up the leakiest defence in the ision while Middlesbrough have been unconvincing at best under Jonathan Woodgate. Danny Cowley and his brother Nicky were managing Braintree Town three years ago and have injected belief into Huddersfield after they became the first of the six second-tier clubs to change managers this season. The one constant throughout has been the outstanding Karlan Grant, who has scored 16 goals in 36 appearances since joining from Charlton in January.No team have been cut adrift and three consecutive draws have halted that sinking feeling at Wigan, who are a point from safety despite not winning since October. After a promising start Charlton have hit a brick wall but Lee Bowyer’s injury-hit side are six points above the drop zone. Barnsley may be a point below the dotted line but there are green shoots under Gerhard Struber. The 22-year-old former Portsmouth striker Conor Chaplin has been central to their mini-revival, having scored seven goals since the Austrian’s arrival in mid-November.Derby’s run of two wins from their past 10 matches is deeply worrying and Philip Cocu’s side appear light on quality, having failed to replace last season’s loanees Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Harry Wilson, all of whom are excelling in the top flight. Derby have not won away and are among the league’s lowest scorers. Enter player-coach Wayne Rooney: the 34-year-old is expected to make his Derby debut on 2 January against Barnsley. Reading have been Jekyll and Hyde since their sporting director, Mark Bowen, was appointed manager in October but should have sufficient quality to stay out of trouble, while Birmingham are above the drop but going nowhere fast after losing three in a row."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6315501ce4a437b2a66d83f7b666dd622c358ff/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea8a9159db42aefc2927df28d96ef72b","title":"i lied to my family and spent christmas day alone","story":"I had a steak – with chips, no sprouts – and a nice bottle of rioja. I went for a walk. There were no arguments about what to watch on TV. Best Christmas everI haven’t always hated Christmas I think I enjoyed it as a kid. Not so much since. It is a little about the food (if turkey and sprouts are such good news, why don’t we eat them on any other day, eh?). It has a little more to do with rampant consumerism. Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath … funny how a festival that is supposed to be about the birth of Christ has come to encompass so many Christian sins. But this isn’t about him it’s about me, my own family and my own insecurities.I think things turned sour in my 30s, when my siblings selfishly started having families of their own. Suddenly there were new people and generations involved it became more complicated logistically, as what had been a simple family gathering exploded. This lot went here, that lot there … oh, God, what about Sam? Where’s he going to go? Whose turn is it? I wasn’t involved in these conversations, but I’m sure they happened. They did in my mind, anyway. I had become the grumpy grandad no one wanted, before even being a dad.I could – and should – have just spent Christmas alone, for everyone’s sake. But that would have made them feel bad, and I didn’t want that or to be felt sorry for. So I went along, to wherever there was room or I was least unwelcome, to whoever’s turn it was. I ate my sprouts – mmm – and I tried to be the fun uncle, and not to disapprove so obviously of the mountains of presents being ripped open (while also, hypocritically, feeling sorry for myself as I strung out the unwrapping of my own pitiful molehill of hastily thrown-together afterthoughts). I don’t think I fooled anyone.And then one year I did fool them – everyone. Uncharacteristically, and improbably, I found myself in the situation known as having a girlfriend (I had had them before, just not for Christmas). She came with a family of her own, and they asked me if I would like to spend Christmas with them. No, of course I bloody wouldn’t, but it gave me an idea. That’s very kind, I said, but I’m spending it with my family. They’d be devastated if I wasn’t there. (Ha!)See where this is going? I then told my family that I would be spending Christmas with my girlfriend’s family – I was keen to get to know them better. And my family concealed any relief they may have been feeling. At least they didn’t need to feel sorry for me because I wouldn’t be alone at home …Which is exactly what and where I was, of course. By myself, as myself. I had a steak – with chips, no sprouts – and a nice bottle of rioja. (I don’t really remember that it was rioja, but in my mind it was a grade or two above the usual. It could have even broken the £10 barrier.) I toasted absent friends and family. Yeah, maybe there was a bit of gluttony involved, but it’s hard to remain sin-free at Christmas. I went for a walk London is beautiful on Christmas Day. There were no arguments about what to watch I caught up on some of the films I had missed in the year just gone. I may have felt a little sorry for myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing so. It was perfect – best Christmas ever. But impossible to repeat.It turns out the girlfriend wasn’t just for Christmas, but for life (so far). We did some new-generation-creating of our own, and since then, as you can imagine, it has been impossible to sneak off. But that’s OK.I still hate Christmas because of the turkey, sprouts and all of that sinning. Also wrapping – I really don’t like wrapping. But now I don’t have to pretend not to hate it: I’m the Grinch, but out and proud. Which is liberating, even amusing – for me. And I’ll always have the memories of the year I went free solo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/014f6ed446aac8634a61e45b265443c3bf984327/0_636_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd8f9e358eebad64b755949613f35401","title":"i wanted everything to be perfect for my new girlfriend then the christmouse turned up","story":"My partner had flown from New York with me to meet my parents. Sadly, I didn’t count on being caught up in my dad’s war with a rodent“Be careful,” I warned E as she stood on the doorstep, suitcases next to her. “You’re walking into a trap.”I meant it literally. There was a mouse in the house and my dad had been trying to catch it for days. Standard traps having proved useless, he had spent hours on YouTube researching homemade devices and had fashioned an elaborate rollercoaster of doom from a plastic bottle, a bucket and a piece of wood. The kitchen looked like a scene from a Wallace and Gromit film.It was Christmas Day, 2017, and E, my girlfriend of several months, had flown into London that morning from New York, where we live, to spend the holiday with my family. It was the first time they were meeting, and I was one part nerves, two parts effervescent excitement. Even though it was early days, I knew E was a keeper. I desperately wanted everything to be perfect and the Christmouse hadn’t been part of the plan.But life doesn’t always go to plan. It can change in an instant. The fact that E was celebrating the holidays with my family that year was particularly special because, just a few months earlier, there had been a moment when I thought I was going to lose my mum. She’d gone into hospital with a suspected heart attack, and been booked in for an angioplasty – a routine procedure. When my dad, my sister and I arrived at the cardiac unit to pick her up, the nurse gave us a worried look and ushered us into a dark little room. “I’m sorry,” he said gravely. “Your mum is no longer with us.” After far too long a pause, in which I nearly had a heart attack myself, he continued. “She’s been moved to the intensive care unit.” The doctor had accidentally cut my mum’s artery, and she had almost bled to death. She was in intensive care for days.She made a full recovery, thankfully, and had built the bulk of our Christmas book tree (a festive tree made out books) that year, while my sister and I squabbled over the creative direction. It had turned out surprisingly well, Pinterest-worthy even, and the moment E stepped into the house she was ushered into the living room and forced to admire it. There was tea, there were hugs, and E was absorbed into the family. The festivities were under way and E’s first experience of a traditional Palestinian-British south London Christmas was about to begin!At that moment, alas, disaster struck. In the post-breakfast lull, E wanted a quick look at the family photo albums. While these contain many pages of Cute Baby Arwa, they also unsparingly document my awkward bowl-cut-and-fluorescent-tracksuit phase. From the ages of seven to 11, I looked like a young, gap-toothed, Richard III on ketamine truly I was a sight to behold and then get as far away as possible from.Thankfully, it was time to do just that. Having flown 3,459 miles to get to my house for the holidays, my sleep-deprived girlfriend then discovered that there were a couple more miles to go. For the past few years my family have spent Christmas at a dear friend’s house along with her family and friends. Laden with booze, food and presents, we set off and I pointed out local landmarks to E as we walked. To the right: the tree my dad once chained himself to when the council erroneously tried to cut it down, mistaking it for the dead tree they were supposed to remove. To the left: one of south London’s most renowned chicken-and-chip shops. Straight ahead: the school hall where I briefly went to Woodcraft Folk (hippy scouts) and had to play cooperative musical chairs, one of the least fun games ever invented.Poor E: after spending 45 minutes sprinting through London with groceries, she was immediately set to work peeling parsnips when we arrived at our destination. When she wasn’t being quizzed by the 1,000 new people she had just met, or being plied with gin, I educated her on the finer points of Christmas cracker etiquette. Christmas crackers aren’t very common in the US however, when I spent Thanksgiving with E’s parents in Boston her family friends brought Thanksgiving crackers with them – which they described as “poppers”, much to my amusement and nobody else’s. I’m obsessed with crackers, so I’d been thrilled by their appearance. And then was shocked when the table proceeded to pop their poppers inidually. Instead of sharing with a neighbour, they just grabbed a side with each of their hands and opened it like that. It was the most American thing I’ve ever seen. I was horrified.Now it was E’s turn to be horrified: another walk was at hand. Before we could eat, it was time for the Great Christmas Stroll. “It’s sort of an English tradition,” I told her as the household filed into the drizzle for a bracing circuit of the common. “You have to suffer a little bit in order to enjoy yourself.”The rest of the day was perfect. Crackers were opened in the appropriate manner there was a lot of food, a lot of bad jokes, and a very competitive Christmas quiz. I have bah-humbugged my way through a lot of Christmases, but, that year, I think I realised how enormously lucky I was to celebrate the holidays with such a loving and accepting family. Christmas is a time to remember not to take anything or anyone for granted and be thankful for everything that you have.I was certainly thankful for E’s resilience. Having barely slept on the flight over, she must have been awake for about 36 hours straight that Christmas. At about 10pm, we left for Mum and Dad’s before the rest of the family – arriving back to a very quiet house where not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Upon inspection, it was clear that the homemade trap had proved quite useless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7206033fa0053fc4f811066ef16eaba125056db/150_95_2263_1358/master/2263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30adf2cc79db7f0f155d31725fdc4079","title":"woke to gammon buzzwords by people coined them","story":"Brexit, millennials, binge-watching… every word in the English language was coined by someone. What’s it like to be an accidental wordsmith?Are we living through a golden age of linguistic inventiveness? Buzzwords and neologisms – from office jargon to the lexicons of democratic chaos in Britain and the US, as well as the ever-expanding culture wars – rain down on us every day, and can gain global currency at the speed of fibre-optic cable. Many, of course, fail – like “Brixit”, an early rival to Brexit, or “Generation Me”, one proposed label for what we now call millennials. Others rapidly become part of the modern conversation. Why, for example, do critics call young, supposedly over sensitive and easily triggered people “snowflakes”? Because in Chuck Palahniuk’s 1996 novel Fight Club, Tyler Durden says: “You are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.”Palahniuk’s contribution, however, was accidental. He later explained: “Back in 1994, when I was writing my book, I wasn’t insulting anyone but myself… My use of the term ‘snowflake’ never had anything to do with fragility or sensitivity.” Instead, he was using it as a means of “deprogramming himself”, so he didn’t believe in his own praise. But the point is that you can’t control what usage will do once it’s out of your hands: a much wider uptake can shift the meaning. The term “woke”, for example, is now used mockingly for a kind of overrighteous liberalism but its first recorded use, by the African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley, was meant to indicate an awareness of political issues, especially those around race, a positive usage that still also persists.Some people coin words for the sheer fun of it – and if the rhythm and pleasure of the sound are sufficient, they might be lucky enough to see it go viral. This is how we got “fashionista” – coined by Stephen Freid in a 1993 biography of the supermodel Gia – and “amazeballs”, first used publicly by the fashion blogger Elizabeth Spiridakis Olson in 2008. It’s easy to forget that every word in the English language has had a first use a language is the record of innumerable creative decisions. Most of those responsible are lost to lexicographical history, but in our online age, it is easier to identify the culprit or heroine.I tracked some of them down. What is it like to see a word you invented get into the dictionary? And how does it feel if it spirals out of control, in ways you never intended?The word Brexit was a tragically unintentional success in verbal invention: coined as a warning, it became a rallying call. In early 2012, the possibility that crisis-stricken Greece might have to leave the Eurozone was labelled “Grexit”, for Greek exit. Then Peter Wilding, a former adviser to David Cameron, left his job as European director of BSkyB in order to set up a thinktank called British Influence, which was designed to celebrate and encourage Britain’s role as a leader in the EU. On 15 May 2012, he published an article on a European blog platform, in which he argued that if Britain’s leaders did not set out a positive vision for membership, “then the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word, Brexit.”Between 2005 and 2008, Wilding had worked in Brussels as media and policy director of the Conservative party in Europe. “I found,” he recalls now, “Britain was running the show. It had all the most powerful portfolios in the European commission. The penny dropped for me: here was Britain as the leading power.”In 2016, Wilding went to see Cameron in Downing Street, brandishing the results of a poll that showed the majority of Britons wanted the country to lead in Europe. “I said to him, ‘You could be the new Churchill here: you could say Britain is a leader in Europe and we’ve achieved all these things.’ He said, ‘No, we just don’t have enough time to roll out this message. We won the Scottish referendum and the general election through fear and the economy, and we’ll win this one the same way.’ I said, ‘You will lose.’”And lose they did. Was part of the problem the sheer energy and brio of the word Brexit itself? In 2012, alternatives had been flying around: both the Economist and the Daily Mail referred to a possible “Brixit”, while others suggested UKExit but Brexit was clearly the most satisfying to pronounce. Wilding says it came to indicate “a stamp of rage: exit, leave, we’ve had enough of it”.Remain is “not a sexy word”, he points out it is partly a result of the successful lobbying by anti-Europe conservatives to avoid having a referendum question that invited the positive answer “Yes” as to whether Britain should stay in the EU. Brexit is now in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defined as “The (proposed) withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the political process associated with it.”When it was named Word of the Year in 2016 by Collins dictionaries, Wilding says, “It was a surprise. It had only recently gone crazy in public discourse. I felt shocked that that would be my footnote in the Brexit saga.” And now? The word Brexit, he thinks, “could go down in history, like Vichy or Versailles, as an epitaph for a nation in decline”.For a long time, the “gig economy” sounded like a glamorous euphemism for a world of zero-hours contracts and piecework. Why worry that giant corporations such as Uber don’t want to class their drivers as employees? If we’re all doing “gigs”, we’re all hip jazzers. (The word “gig” – “etymology unknown”, remarks the OED – has meant a musical engagement since the 1920s.) But the phrase was originally coined as a criticism.On 12 January 2009, the journalist and editor Tina Brown wrote an article for the Daily Beast website, observing: “No one I know has a job anymore. They’ve got Gigs.”Increasingly, people she knew who used to have staff jobs in the media were working in two or three part-time positions, or freelance. “To people I know in the bottom income brackets, living paycheck to paycheck, the Gig Economy has been old news for years,” she added. “What’s new, is the way it’s hit the demographic that used to assume that a college degree from an elite school was the passport to job security.” Now everyone was a member of “the hustling class”, and company managers were “mesmerised by the notion that everyone can now be hired cheap – that everyone is slave labour”.That was 10 years ago, and it looks awfully prophetic. When people began to use the word “gig” in this context, Brown says now, it worked to project “a subterfuge coolness over a predicament caused by an economic downshift. It’s cool to say, ‘I’ve got these gigs’ rather than to say, ‘My main job has disappeared.’ Because of its cool sound, it helped to familiarise people with the phenomenon.”Does she regret helping to make precariousness sound cool? She laughs. “My only regret is that if I’d had a book called The Gig Economy I would have made a lot of money. I feel rather proud when I see conferences called Managing the Gig Economy – it’s my baby.” Of late, the euphemistic sheen of the phrase seems to have worn off, in any case. When questions are asked in parliament about the gig economy, it is in the context of protecting its vulnerable workers rather than celebrating their freedoms.The gig economy, Brown points out, leaves US workers without healthcare, and might have harmed social cohesion: “I think everybody became so desperate scrabbling around doing their three jobs that the last thing they cared about was other people.”It’s not as though everything was perfect before. “Those jobs people depended on turned out to be treacherous things,” she says, adding that at least these days, “if you get sacked from one gig you still have two others”.Millennials, eh? They are everywhere, with their selfies and their avocado toast and their feckless refusal to save for a house deposit. The Urban Dictionary has it right that millennial is the “name an old person gives a young person they don’t like”.From the 17th century, “millennial” could be used as a synonym for “millenarian”: associated with the belief that the second coming of Christ was imminent and would usher in a 1,000-year era of peace. But it was first used to describe a specific cohort of people – those who would come of age in the year 2000 – in a 1991 book by Neil Howe and William Strauss entitled Generations: The History Of America’s Future, 1584 To 2069.Howe explains they were looking for a name for “the high-school class of 2000, coming of age in the new millennium”, and wanted an upbeat label, so millennials it was. Chuckling, Howe notes that the name for the previous cohort, Generation X, had not yet been coined while they were writing the book. (Douglas Coupland’s novel Generation X was published in the same year.) “So to make Gen Xers feel even worse about themselves,” he says, “the generation that came after them was named before they were.” Gen Xers won’t mind, of course, he adds: “They have that self-deprecating sense of humour.”The term millennials did not really explode in popularity until well into the new millennium. For much of the 1990s, Howe points out, it did battle with rival labels such as Generation Y. That name, he says, “was almost always the more derogatory alternative. People used it to make the point that this new generation was everything the Xers were, but more extreme. More commercial, more risk-taking, totally over the top. You know, like ‘Gen Xers are a little bit alienated from family life, but these kids are just off the charts.’” By contrast, he and Strauss were forecasting that millennials would be “closer to their family, more into community, more optimistic about the future”.Talking about the differences between generations, Howe says now, is “like a Rorschach test. You’re talking about politics, culture, demography, social science, epidemiology. It acquires the colour of the emotion that the person who uses it wants it to have.” If millennials mainly has a mocking or derogatory sense now, that says more about the older generations who use it that way than about millennials themselves.“Naming a generation is like shooting a bullet into a cave and watching it ricochet everywhere,” Howe says. “You never know where it’s going to come out.”For more than a decade, the hot buzzword for companies who want to profit from people’s talent without paying for it has been crowdsourcing. This is a clever play on outsourcing (moving jobs to external contractors, or overseas), combined with an allusion to James Surowiecki’s 2004 bestseller The Wisdom O f Crowds, which celebrated collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia, and the surprising accuracy of prediction markets, where aggregate betting on events such as elections can forecast outcomes better than experts.Two years previously, Wired’s editor-in-chief, Chris Anderson, had coined the phrase “the Long Tail” to describe the potential longterm viability of niche products on services such as Amazon or Netflix (then a DVD-rental business), and that had become a hit book. “So the term crowdsourcing was, in the very beginning, half meant to parody the emergence of such buzzwords,” Howe says.At the same time, he was interested in the possibilities of the new collaborative model of creativity. “One thing about being at Wired in those days,” he recalls, “was that we really did have our ear to the rail in terms of the tech industry and culture. So we knew the timing was right, that there was this thing starting to happen and no one knew what to call it.”The word took off with amazing rapidity. “Within two weeks, there were 600,000 mentions on Google. And it never slowed down.” He published a bestselling book of the same name in 2008, and is now a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston. “One thing I’d say is that we really did need a word at the time,” Howe adds. “It wasn’t one of those bullshit marketing words that get adopted by management-consultant types. There was something really exciting taking place in the mid-2000s, and we didn’t have a language for it yet.”Indeed. Crowdsourcing might have been used since in cynical ways, and appropriated by huge brands such as Starbucks (which, since 2008 has solicited customer improvements through its My Starbucks Idea website) and McDonald’s (which in 2014 sold “crowdsourced” burgers), but it can also describe the kind of global altruistic effort that only the internet makes possible.There’s something about the phrase binge-watching that sums up not only modern modes of media consumption but our whole culture. It’s the perfect metaphor for Netflix-era humans, whom Aristotle would have called “incontinent” in their desires: wanting more and more of the same, with no patience or self-control. We are all the toddlers who fail the notorious (and lately disputed) marshmallow test, according to which a child who is able to wait for a sweet at a tender age will turn out to be more self-reliant and successful as an adult.In northern English dialect, to binge meant to soak a wooden barrel, and so a binge came to mean, from the 19th century, a drinking spree, as it is defined in a Northamptonshire dictionary of the time: “A man goes to the alehouse to get a good binge, or to binge himself.”The word binge-watching, too, dates from more innocent times: still long before the advent of online streaming. It is first recorded in 1996, when to watch all the episodes of a series in a row meant acquiring a set of VHS tapes. That is what a science graduate student in New England named Bob Donahue was looking for when he posted the following to a local Usenet discussion group that year: “I’ve just become hooked on The X-Files, so I’m a little behind... Does anyone by ANY chance have tapes of this show back to season 1 they’d be willing to lend me so I can effectively catch up? I’d be more than happy to travel out to wherever to get them and then bring them back (actually there are three of us who all got hooked at the same time, so I’d predict that there’d be some MASSIVE binge-watching right away! :-)”.“What a cool revelation!” Donahue says now, when I tell him that he probably coined the phrase. “But, to be honest, I have zero recollection as to whether I made up the phrase off-the-cuff, or if I was using something I had heard before. I’m afraid I’ve had no thoughts about it over the years because, honestly, I don’t remember doing it.”After a career as an astrophysicist and now a web developer for an educational foundation, Donahue still occasionally does the thing he named: “Some shows – like Game Of Thrones – are just too irresistible.”After he coined binge-watching as a gerund (or verbal noun), the verb “to binge-watch” followed. It is also first recorded on Usenet, where someone in 1998 asked in a post: “Do you ever binge watch (marathon)?” This was also in the context of The X-Files, so really, it was Scully and Mulder who started it all. In online lexicographical history, the truth is out there. “I suppose that’s one of the cool things about the internet,” Donahue says. “You never know what sort of reach something you say will have.”On 8 June 2017, the British children’s author Ben Davis was drunkenly hate-watching Question Time on BBC One. Fed up, he tweeted a picture of various red-faced older men who had been speaking from the audience, and wrote: “Whatever happens, hopefully politicians will start listening to young ppl after this. This Great Wall of gammon has had its way long enough.”“When I sent out that tweet, even in my drunken state, I had no inkling it would have any impact,” Davis says. “I thought it would get lost in the ether. When I started getting requests from serious news organisations to discuss gammon, my conviction that the world had gone irrevocably insane only deepened.”Gammon, it turned out, had legs: it was joyously adopted by the left to describe flushed, middle-aged white people with reactionary views and, in time, anyone pro-Brexit. A year later, baffled Americans were discussing how Brits were now having a serious debate about whether gammon was a racist word.Other commentators retorted that gammon could not possibly be racist and was fine as a word with which to abuse, you know, gammons. In more sedate corners of the media, some devotees of philology explored the historical context: in 18th-century thieves’ jargon, a gammon was someone who distracted the mark’s attention in the 19th century, gammon could also mean stuff and nonsense, of the kind a modern gammon might perhaps spout. The journalist Caitlin Moran deserves some share of the originating credit, too, for having described David Cameron in 2012 as “a slightly camp gammon robot”.“I’m in two minds about the gammon thing,” Davis says now. “When it’s used against genuine bigots, I’m fine with it. When I see it used as shorthand for a working-class person, I’m not so keen. I’m also not exactly proud of creating another weapon in the online culture war, which shows no signs of stopping.”Is there a message in this story, too, about how social media and alcohol are perhaps not the safest bedfellows? “I’m pretty sure that was my only foray into drunk-tweeting and I’m certain it will be my last,” Davis says. “In fact, I think all electronic-communications devices should be fitted with breathalysers.”• Steven Poole’s A Word For Every Day Of The Year is published by Quercus at £14.99.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6149b0956c1226fc974a08d79cb76668b573521e/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584a273cc23f9b2111eb78eba23ac3ba","title":"its in the stars charting the return of astrology podcast","story":"Astrology is back! ’s Aamna Modhin looks at why millennial women are taking life advice from the stars.

She is likely to go up against Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who both pushed for a position in favour of a second referendum.Two other leading candidates are Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is supported by the Corbynite wing of the party, and Clive Lewis, a candidate on the pro-European left.Jess Phillips, the backbencher and women’s rights campaigner, is also expected to stand.Following Nandy’s intervention, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, defended the decision to allow Miliband to be involved in the inquiry.He said the former party leader “is one of many people who should be properly examining why we lost”, even though Miliband oversaw a major defeat himself.Khan, who served in Miliband’s shadow cabinet, said: “I’m fed up with losing. I don’t believe in heroic failure, we’ve lost four general elections now in a row.“I want the next leader to unite our party, unite our country, unite those who voted leave with those who voted remain, unite the north with the south, the old with the young.“And that’s one of the reasons why it’s important not just Ed Miliband but many others look at why we lost and learn the right lessons.”Khan also said the next Labour leader should not be chosen on the basis of their gender or the location of their constituency, amid calls from some for Corbyn’s successor to be a woman and from the north or Midlands to help Labour win back its heartlands that turned Tory.Without backing any candidate, he said: “I think the idea that the next Labour leader should be chosen on the geography of their seat or their gender is wrong. I want to see the Labour leader chosen on the ideas he or she has, on their vision for our country and a proper analysis of why we lost.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e7810f77349d9565444f65c560dba7552204bee/780_61_2386_1431/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74fa70fa3ff40a8b0777befc0e2e6167","title":"john bercow decries populism in alternative christmas message","story":"Ex-Commons Speaker condemns those who promise easy solutions in Channel 4 rival to Queen’s broadcast John Bercow has condemned populism and those who promise easy solutions to complex problems in Channel 4’s alternative Christmas message.The former Commons Speaker started his speech describing himself as a “cheerleader” for parliamentary democracy and MPs. “The overwhelming majority work hard to protect and promote the interest of the people they are charged to represent,” he said.In the five-minute speech, which aired on Channel 4 just before the Queen’s Christmas broadcast began on BBC One, Bercow quoted Winston Churchill and impersonated the veteran leftwing Labour politician Tony Benn.Bercow, who stepped down in November after more than 10 years in the role, said democracy had taken a pounding: “All around the world, populism and the promise of simple solutions to complex problems has taken hold with a vice-like grip. Don’t get me wrong, it’s crucial for everyone to be free to say what they think and for politicians to respond, but democracy shouldn’t be about decibel levels. An opinion is no more valid because it is expressed more loudly, repeatedly, or abusively.”He quickly accepted that he has become known for raising his voice, but added: “What bothers me is there are people on the internet and in some newspapers who cannot entertain the idea that anyone can honourably hold an opinion which differs from their own. They are the angels and anyone who dares disagree is the devil who wants the country to be poorer, less free, or less secure. That mindset started to infect parliament too. That is wrong.”“If democrats show no respect for each other, it just encourages anti-democrats. It’s high time we learned to disagree agreeably.”He went on to say his best friend was not an extremist, a racist, or a fascist because he was a Brexiter, nor was he a traitor, a malcontent, or an enemy of the people because he was a remainer.Bercow follows the actor Danny Dyer, the whistleblower Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, in delivering the annual rival to the Queen’s broadcast. Channel 4 has produced an alternative message for the past 25 years.The speech was delivered from a classroom in Bercow’s children’s state secondary school. He went on to criticise the role social media has played in amplifying hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse.“As I sit here in my kids’ fantastic state secondary, I have to say I worry about that. Incidentally, if you want to see an example of respectful debate, take a look at the UK youth parliament,” he said. “They spoke well, respected one another, and behaved better than many political campaigners, two, three and four times their age.”Bercow continued: “Let’s take inspiration from young people. They are the future. Let’s try to re-establish a civility of discourse. It would be good for parliament, for democracy, and for our own mental health – an issue which is finally getting the attention it needs.”As Bercow’s calls for “Order!” have made him an international celebrity, he ended his speech saying it with a group of schoolchildren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf93b306a89bf7f06e9483a4b424c2dc3b74d0b/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae57b64c2892a76a51bdfe2b1442cd1","title":"sadiq khan urges pm work with him to end rough sleeping","story":"London mayor speaks at Christmas Eve event for 100 homeless people at City HallOne hundred homeless people spent Christmas Eve afternoon at City Hall in London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, said society was letting down those without homes.Amid the festive cheer of the first ever such event – where Khan helped serve a three-course lunch of smoked salmon, roast turkey and pear tart before many took to karaoke – people spoke of their struggles accessing services and the omnipresence of drugs, as well as opportunities to gamble, on the streets.“You’re made to scream for help and unless you do that it doesn’t come,” said Scott, a 45-year-old who slept in a park for a year. “You have to fight tooth and nail for what you are entitled to.”Now, however, he has his own flat – after being helped by the charity St Mungo’s. “I was lucky,” he said. “It takes most people about four years, if at all. We definitely need more social homes built. They want to move you on from the hostels but they can’t.”Cherelle, 30, explained how she was evicted from her housing association home for falling into rent arrears while she was sectioned, and lived in a cupboard at a housing block before being forced to move on.“There was no safety net, being mentally ill and addicted to drugs, it’s a double-edged sword,” she said. “You’re always fighting a battle. You’ve got to be at rock bottom before someone says here’s a hand. Rather than being able to ask for help before you get to that point.”She is now living in one of the St Mungo’s accommodation centres, along with many others of those at the event – none of whom is still sleeping rough. However, some have had to move to other boroughs away from their support networks to get a roof over their head.Almost 9,000 people were seen sleeping rough in London by outreach workers last year, more than double the number in 2010-11, according to the mayor’s office.Rough sleeping has also more than doubled across England and Wales over the last decade, and there is growing public concern. Churches, libraries and other buildings in Bradford, Newcastle upon Tyne, Derry and elsewhere were opened on Tuesday to provide Christmas dinners for homeless people.Next to the River Thames at City Hall, while people watched the seasonal film Elf and played Jenga, Khan called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to work with him to end rough sleeping.“I don’t pretend today is going to solve all these problems, it’s about giving some vulnerable Londoners a special experience at this time of year to raise awareness about these issues, and to give people hope that we can end rough sleeping once and for all,” he told the .The mayor said he has persuaded councils to provide shelter to all rough sleepers when temperatures approach zero in any borough in London.Downing Street has announced an extra £63m in funds to help tackle homelessness, but Labour said it was “too little, too late”. Khan blamed a lack of social housing, an unfit-for-purpose private rental market and social care cuts as well as the “disastrous” universal credit system for helping to drive increased homelessness.“I say merry Christmas to Boris Johnson, congratulations on the general election victory, but let’s work together to solve this,” he said. “I think we are judged as a society by how we treat the most vulnerable and we’re letting them down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8520c534e1ec7cad345cc9350cff5a46eb773603/0_16_5327_3197/master/5327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1060165823e2c7d27f0b6797d759b556","title":"joe root england first test south africa special jonny bairstow","story":"Preparations for the first South Africa Test have been severely disrupted and Jonny Bairstow could be drafted into the XI“We’ll just try to make sure no one goes into the game under the weather” is not the most belligerent battle cry for a leader but that was one of the messages from Joe Root before the first Test at Centurion. “Once more unto the ibuprofen, dear friends, once more” does not work that well, either. But a beleaguered Root has been doing his best to balance positivity with pragmatism before a much-anticipated series.It is very inconvenient that his squad has been attacked by a flu bug since their arrival in South Africa and much more agonising that Ben Stokes’s father, Ged, is currently seriously ill in a Johannesburg hospital, which cast doubts over Stokes’ participation in the Test match. The update from the ECB on Christmas morning was cautiously optimistic. Ged Stokes had “shown signs of improvement. He has responded positively to treatment and is now in a stable condition.” As a consequence Stokes was able to take a full part in England’s Christmas Day practice.However three players were not fit enough to attend that session: Jack Leach, Chris Woakes and a new victim of the bug, Ollie Pope. So this trio must be considered very doubtful starters for the Test. No one has been ruled out, not even the two late replacements from Somerset, Craig Overton and Dom Bess. “Could they play?” Root was asked. “Yes, they wouldn’t have been called up if that wasn’t the case and we want to make sure we’ve got all bases covered and that we can go in with whatever balance to the side we want to try to take 20 poles.”Unsurprisingly in his current plight Root is keen to point out that strange things can come to pass in adversity: “When unfortunate circumstances happen it provides opportunities for people to step up, take responsibility and do something special.” At Centurion there is the possibility that Jonny Bairstow, for example, may now be drafted into the final XI, which would be a chance to make himself undroppable for the rest of the series.The selection for the first Test was tricky enough for England without all the recent complications. Traditionally the playing surface favours pace bowlers rather than spinners so both sides have been contemplating going without a specialist spinner. At least South Africa’s Keshav Maharaj is in the peak of health.Beyond the spaghetti bowl of motorways that surround the stadium here there is more green grass in evidence on the pitch than was witnessed in Hamilton, New Zealand, where England spurned a specialist spinner. At Centurion there should be more bounce and the possibility of sideways movement. If the forecast for hot weather is reliable Faf du Plessis, South Africa’s captain, expects the cracks to open as the game progresses and then “the ball can misbehave it can go up and down”, a situation that excites tall, fast bowlers.There is now every chance that Jimmy Anderson will return to the fray, which will mean that he chalks up his 150th Test match. Already he has propelled 2,340 more deliveries in Test cricket than any other pace bowler. The West Indies’ Courtney Walsh takes second place on this list. Anderson was the most effective of England’s pacemen in Benoni recently and there is no doubt that he has impressed his captain. “He used that time away to improve himself physically,” said Root, “and by doing this he set a really good example to the group, such is his drive and determination. He has done so much work on his strength and fitness. He’s in as good a shape as I’ve seen.” Ideally England would like Stuart Broad and Jofra Archer alongside him but that will depend much more on fitness assessments than form.Du Plessis has a clearer idea of his team. Expect debuts for Rassie van der Dussen and Dwaine Pretorius, who is likely to fill the all-rounder slot at No 7. If South Africa were to omit Maharaj, perhaps an unnecessary gamble since they have four seamers, they would give a debut to Beuran Hendricks or Dane Paterson, both pace bowlers.It seems that the mood around South African cricket has lightened over the past two weeks since the appointments of the recent giants of their game, Graeme Smith, Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis, to take charge of affairs beyond the boundary. Du Plessis acknowledged that over the last six months “it feels that there has been more weight on my shoulders. There haven’t been the right structures in place off the field, though that’s no excuse for some of the cricket we’ve played. But the last fortnight has been a breath of fresh air and there has been a very positive feel to our training.“I’ve been around a long time now but even I feel like there has been so much more wisdom around our dressing room. And I think: ‘Why hasn’t that been there for the last ten years or so?’ Recently Australia have had that with Langer, Ponting and Waugh. We need that, too.”Meanwhile Root is more concerned about the presence of his current players in the England dressing room throughout the Centurion Test match. In particular he knows that Stokes has been the fulcrum of the side over the past nine months. But any selectorial issues that relate to him will be dictated by Stokes himself. “It is absolutely up to him whether he plays,” said Root. “Family comes first for Ben. All we can do is throw all our support behind him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60443389484f940919064274c8a1f0c26d9d8738/0_350_4161_2497/master/4161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82938cd9d5f9d714254c512ca77a10c9","title":"gavin and stacey christmas special review absolutely crackin","story":"The Billericay-Barry massive are back. And we won’t tell a lie ... in these less innocent times, they are most welcomeIt’s been nearly a decade since we last saw Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Billericay-Barry massive. It feels like a lifetime ago. James Corden and Ruth Jones’s creation was born in and of a different era. Whether it was of stability or complacency you can choose according to tasteexperiencepolitical conviction, but it can hardly be argued that it wasn’t a more easeful one either way.Even if you weren’t a fan the first time round, travelling back there now in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special feels like an hour’s respite, sorely needed. And fans will find much to enjoy.Gavin and Stacey have three children now and, while familiarity has not bred contempt, they are in a bit of a rut. Stacey particularly feels the lack of excitement – and sex – in their lives. Not that she isn’t happy with their decision to get kitchen cupboards in the January sales rather than buy each other Christmas presents, you understand.Smithy is still a reliable presence in her and Neil’s life, but his and Ness’s casual hookups ceased when he took up with a new girlfriend, Sonia, nearly a year ago. “I’ve had the odd scrag end tossed my way on the island,” she tells Stacey, with the weary contempt of a goddess stuck too long among mortals. “But that doesn’t even touch the sides.” Smithy is on the verge of asking Sonia to marry him. No one has met her yet. Gavin worries.It is the Welsh contingent’s turn to host the family festivities this year. For Gavin’s mother Pam, this is akin to being asked to spend the night in a stable, so she is busy trying to pack the contents of her immaculate Essex home into two small bags, insect spray, mattress topper, towels, Bear Grylls survival kit and all. They have only to deal with Dawn and Peter’s latest marital meltdown – she has found a spliff in his glovebox and assumed a secret heroin addiction. But because Dawn is played by Julia Davis, the whole scene is invested with such unspoken horrors and suffused with such thick dread before the truth is revealed, it is a wonder we don’t all choke on our own primal fears before it’s done. The woman is a witch.In Barry, Bryn is preparing the meal “for over 13 people!” and putting final touches to his schedule, checking Gwen’s oven dimensions and tracking down the plate-warmer Glenda claims she never borrowed. It’s all go, but we must maintain our faith in Bryn otherwise we have nothing on this earth.There are the traditional array of minor misadventures: Pam forgets to bring the Christmas puddings with her and the replacements from Morrisons are left in the pub, the kids scupper Stacey and Gavin’s attempt to bone, and Bryn incurs an unfair debt of £5 to Dick Powell regarding some bread sauce.Gavin and Stacey’s rutlack of rutting problems are quickly solved by a trip down memory lane – or at least round the island – because their narrative is the main concern in name only. The beating heart of the show remains, as it was always destined to be when two actors write a show, the characters the creators play: Smithy and Ness. After getting drunk in the pub on Christmas Eve, the pair wake up in bed together the next morning. Sonia is due to arrive shortly. Smithy is stricken. Ness tells him nothing happened. Smithy, relieved, sallies forth. Sonia arrives and is awful. Smithy is unrecognisable around her. Ness tells Stacey that they did in fact sleep together. They’re just one of those couples. “We’re like Hall and Oates. Morecambe and Wise. Mel and Sue.” Sonia is baffled and uncomfortable around the gang and opts to head to her parents’ house earlier than planned. Smithy opts to stay. Ness comes out to talk to him as Sonia drives off. I won’t spoil what happens next except to say that it’s a crackin’ ending. Tidy, you might say.

While his chances of replacing the party’s most successful ever leader are still seen as low, the veteran politician’s short campaign has gathered rapid momentum.Calling for a “renaissance” of the Israeli right, Saar has focused on Netanyahu’s inability to form a government, a failure that has tipped the country into months of political paralysis. An unprecedented third national election is set for 2 March.“He (Netanyahu) has failed twice, but it is not because of the Likud’s ideas,” Saar said as he launched his campaign. “If we do not make a change, we are getting close to a leftwing government,” he warned as supporters chanted: “Only Saar can!”Despite his outwardly restrained manner, the former interior and education minister has often been pegged as the next Likud leader. His is talked about excitedly in rightwing circles by those who see him as quietly capable.In an apparent attempt to woo Netanyahu fans – but ones who are hankering for change – Saar promised on Monday to push to get the prime minister appointed as Israel’s next president.The 52-year-old former lawyer and journalist was brought into politics by Netanyahu two decades ago. But he left in 2014 for five years after tensions rose between him and the prime minister, who saw him as a threat. Last year Netanyahu accused Saar of orchestrating a coup against him.In October, after another muddied election and as Netanyahu’s legal woes began to snowball, Saar openly challenged him – a rarity in a party known for fierce loyalty – with a single tweet. When Netanyahu suggested he would consider a leadership battle to firm up his mandate, Saar responded on Twitter: “I’m ready.”A staunch nationalist, Saar is seen as even more hardline regarding Israel’s continuing control of the Palestinian territories, but within Israel’s domestic politics, he is considered pragmatic.Vitally, many think Saar could forge a deal with the opposition Blue and White party if the March election delivers a similarly uncertain result, as polls have predicted. Blue and White’s leader, the former army chief Benny Gantz, has ruled out joining a coalition with a prime minister under indictment but not other Likud figures.Netanyahu and Saar have toured the country this week to rally support. Israeli media predict a solid win for Netanyahu, although Saar has gained backing from a handful of Likud lawmakers and hundreds of activists.The stakes could not be higher for Netanyahu, both professionally and personally. Charges against him include fraud, breach of trust and bribery, which could lead to jail time. If he retains the role of prime minister, Netanyahu is not legally obliged to step down from public office and could use his position to push for immunity.Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a “witch-hunt”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bac1948a13ac6379d34d7404a0e4f7c5184192/1061_0_4621_2773/master/4621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73ae799fbbc38e0aed6ece641144cb5","title":"cctv installed at karl marx grave in highgate cemetery","story":"Cameras intended as vandalism deterrent after it was twice defaced this yearSurveillance cameras have been installed in Highgate cemetery to watch over the tomb of Karl Marx after it was vandalised twice this year.The CCTV devices have been mounted on two tree trunks either side of the Grade I-listed monument. Meanwhile, a marble plaque that was severely damaged in the attacks, in January and February 2019, has been removed for restoration.The decision to install the cameras was made by the Marx Grave Trust, which owns the monument, after consultation with security experts and Historic England, the public body that oversees the country’s built heritage.The Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, which was also involved in the decision, said Marx’s grave is the first in the cemetery to be surveilled by cameras. The move is designed to deter vandals, including the uncaught suspects who carried out both attacks earlier this year.Visitors to Marx’s tomb had not noticed the newly installed cameras until they were pointed out by the .“It is a bit freaky that they are there,” said Frank, a tourist from just outside Berlin, who was visiting the cemetery with his wife Jana. As a boy, Frank was involved in a project to clean Marx’s tomb during a visit to London from his home in what was then East Germany. “It is sad that it is thought necessary,” he said, nodding towards one of the cameras.“In Germany this wouldn’t be possible,” Jana said, referring to Germany’s restrictive laws on CCTV cameras. “You see them in some public places, but never in a cemetery.” Neither Frank nor Jana wanted to give their surnames.Marx himself never advocated surveillance, but he inspired regimes that exercised unprecedented surveillance over their citizens in the name of his communist ideas. George Orwell’s 1984 satirised such regimes with a dystopian vision of a society that was spied on day and night by the all-seeing and all-powerful Big Brother.Jean Seaton, a professor of media history at Westminster University and director of the Orwell prize, said Orwell would be amused by cameras watching over Marx’s tomb.“You can imagine the Orwell humbug eyebrow going up. He would find it funny that even a grave is now subject to surveillance,” she said.Seaton added: “It is wonderfully ironic that Marx, the great outsider, has to be protected in this way as an inidual – because that is what the grave represents. All the statues of Marx that have been knocked down were of him as an idol, but the tomb at Highgate represents him as a human. For all Marx’s influence, the uniqueness of iniduals is still something that we hold very important. It’s why we find the desecration of gravestone so appalling and such a taboo.”The plaque damaged by vandals dates back to the original 1883 gravestone for Karl Marx and his wife Jenny von Westphalen. It was incorporated into the current tomb under a bust of Marx when it was constructed in 1954.In the first attack in January vandals were suspected of using a hammer to damage the text of Marx’s name. In the second attack in February they are thought to have used a bigger hammer to damage the text. In the second attack they also daubed the monument in slogans painted in red including “doctrine of hate” and “architect of genocide”. The police were informed of both attacks but subsequent investigations were limited because there were no witnesses or forensic evidence to identify the suspect.The damaged plaque has been temporarily replaced with a photographed facsimile while it is being repaired.John Briggs, from Solihull, who was visiting Highgate cemetery for the first time, was disturbed by the vandalism. “You should be allowed to rest in peace, whatever your political views,” he said.But he didn’t mind the cameras. “They don’t trouble me, they are just a fact of life now.”Asked if he shared Marx’s views, he said: “I wasn’t happy with the election result, but I’m not a Marxist.”Adam, another visitor who didn’t want to give his full name, questioned whether the cameras would prevent more vandalism. “They’re not really much of a deterrent. They could be lights or even bird boxes. If you wanted it to be deterrent you’d need a sign saying it was CCTV but that probably isn’t right in cemetery.”Ian Dungavell, the chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, confirmed that as the owners of the monument, it was the Marx Grave Trust that chose to install the cameras. He said: “They are discreet but not invisible and intended as a deterrent. If people are worried about the security of their graves we are always happy to accommodate them.”He also revealed there were plans to put up notices to alert visitors to Marx’s tomb that they were being filmed. The Marx Grave Trust has not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e900c27ebdfd1eccfdf8b33703c50ab1595043bd/0_515_4696_2817/master/4696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e760c14daea270471888ec588d66669","title":"erdogan arrives in tunisia for surprise talks with president","story":"Turkish leader’s visit comes as Ankara moves to strike deals with Mediterranean nationsThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has arrived in Tunisia on a surprise visit for talks with his Tunisian counterpart, his office has said.The visit, the first by a head of state since the Tunisian presidential elections in the autumn, comes as Turkey has ramped up efforts to strike deals with nations on the Mediterranean, where Ankara has been at odds with Greece over resources off the coast of the ided island of Cyprus.Last month, Turkey signed a maritime delimitation agreement with Libya’s internationally recognised government, a move that enraged Greece. Athens says the deal violates international law, but Ankara says it aims to protect its rights in the region and is in full compliance with maritime laws.In a statement, Erdoğan’s office said he was accompanied on Wednesday by his foreign and defence ministers, as well as his intelligence chief. Erdoğan said he had discussed with his Tunisian counterpart, Kais Saied, possible steps and cooperation to establish a ceasefire in Libya.At a news conference alongside Saied, Erdoğan said he believed Tunisia would have “valuable and constructive” contributions to creating stability in Libya, and added that a ceasefire must be established as soon as possible.The visit is the first by a head of state to Tunisia since the election of Saied in October, after parliamentary elections.As part of its expanded cooperation with Tunisia’s neighbour Libya, Ankara also signed a military cooperation deal with Fayez al-Sarraj’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord.Erdoğan has said Turkey may deploy troops in support of the GNA, which has been fighting off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces to the east of the country.On Tuesday, the presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey may need to draft a bill to send troops into Libya, adding that parliament was working on it. Ankara’s possible deployment into Libya has also alarmed Russia, which said it was very concerned by such a prospect.Turkey has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a UN arms embargo, according to a UN report last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72ed71500c839a6c60959473dc33e20379a64d2/32_26_5055_3033/master/5055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df7b59349dfdcebed8811bc4b608b9d1","title":"how whistleblowing became an industry in the wake of metoo","story":"Bank scandal another reason why firms put more safeguards in place for staff seeking to flag up concerns Advising companies on setting up whistleblower services has become a burgeoning industry in the wake of the #MeToo movement and a high-profile scandal at Barclays, with businesses spending up to £100,000 to establish services for concerned staff.Demand for whistleblowing consultancies, dedicated call centres, specialist software and independent investigators has escalated after accusations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein – who has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and sexual assault in New York – and the revelation that the chief executive of Barclays had attempted to track down an internal whistleblower.One law firm specialising in whistleblowing cases has described a “feeding frenzy” among companies keen to put stronger safeguards and structures in place for staff seeking to flag illegal or concerning behaviour. Mary Inman, a partner at the law firm Constantine Cannon, said the £642,000 fine imposed by the UK City regulator last year on the Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, for trying to unmask a whistleblower has triggered a surge in business for companies that provide whistleblowing programmes.“Jes Staley handed them all a big gift,” Inman said, adding that it forced companies to think: “Wow, we’d better take these things seriously.” She said: “It was a huge reputational issue.”Staley apologised for trying to unmask the whistleblower, who raised concerns over the bank’s hiring of the chief executive’s friend and former colleague. The Barclays boss used the bank’s internal security team and a US law enforcement agency in an attempt to track down the author of letters that flagged worries about the hire.Alongside ever evolving regulatory requirements and the rise of the #MeToo movement, the incident helped spark a rise in demand for firms such as whistleblowing consultancies and dedicated call centres that collect tip-offs and complaints. They compete with software firms that build secure inbox software and online chat channels, offering digital alternatives to telephone hotlines. Finally, to follow up on whistleblower intel, contractors will investigate complaints or train up internal staff to do the same.But their services do not come cheap. Costs range from about £1,000, which may cover a basic programme audit for a small firm, to as much as £100,000 for annual software licence fees billed to a complex multinational business. Andrew Samuels, who helped build the whistleblowing programme at Barclays bank, launched his own whistleblowing consultancy, Addveritas, in 2016 after noticing a gap in the market. The consultancy founder says whistleblowers need to be seen as “assets rather than liabilities” who can offer information that will help retain staff, prevent fraud and protect profits. But it is important to take the time and join the dots. “Something that seems quite innocuous at the start can end up being a lot more sinister,” Samuels warned. He cited one example in which a whistleblower’s persistent concerns over unsanitary conditions in an office led to the discovery that contractors called in to deal with the problem were defrauding the firm, via a company insider. Addveritas has competition from established rivals, including EY and Deloitte, which offer services ning consultation and investigations. There are also call centres, secure inbox creators and chatroom “portals” run by firms including EQS, WhistleB, Expolink and Whispli, founded by the whistleblower Sylvain Mansotte.Mansotte uncovered a A$20m (£10.3m) fraud scandal at his former employer, the Australian miner Leighton, which put one of his former colleagues behind bars. But Mansotte was originally put off by the thought of leaving a tip on his employer’s staff hotline, worrying that his French accent would give him away.That concern spawned the idea for Whispli, which offers a digital inbox and online chatbox that generates new identities for every whistleblowing report. Those reports cannot be traced back to the employee until they are comfortable coming forward, he explained.The company – run by about 20 staff, with offices in Australia, the US and France – is raking in annual licensing fees of between £10,000 to £100,000 per client. “It predominantly depends on the number of countries you’re plugged into, the number of languages you need,” he said.The whistleblower-turned-entrepreneur estimates that the wider industry is worth as much as $2bn in the US and $4.5bn globally – and investors are taking notice.Whispli, for example, is expecting to raise more than $10m in its next funding round. Another player, Navex Global, which owns the whistleblowing portal called EthicsPoint, was snapped up by the private equity firm BC Partners last year in a deal that valued the firm at $1.2bn. A separate US competitor, Convercent, has attracted about $80m in funding since 2013.Whistleblower lawyer Inman says the space is getting crowded. “They seem to show up at a lot of compliance conferences – they all have booths and they’re all selling something. So I think it’s a big industry that you’d expect would crop up as soon as all the Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies need to have these gold-plated whistleblower programmes.”She expects most companies to make a beeline for “plug and play” products, such as anonymous hotlines, that are quick and easy to use. But the real work is building a corporate culture that encourages and supports whistleblowing across the business.“It’s a cultural change that needs to happen. And what needed to happen in Barclays was the tone from the top,” Inman said. “We really need to mean it when we say: ‘We want to hear from you about problems.’”Enron Sherron Watkins, a former vice-president at Enron Corp, tried to warn her bosses of a massive accounting fraud only months before the world’s biggest energy firm collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001.Olympus The Olympus president, Michael Woodford, uncovered a £1bn accounting fraud at the Japanese digital camera firm in 2011 after flagging suspicious payments made in the course of corporate takeovers. It led to the conviction of three former executives.Danske Bank Howard Wilkinson, who served as the head of Danske Bank’s trading unit in the Baltic region until 2014, blew the whistle on an alleged €200bn (£178bn) money-laundering scandal at the lender. HSBC Hervé Falciani, an IT specialist, exposed wrongdoing at HSBC’s Swiss private bank, which allegedly turned a blind eye to tax evasion and money laundering by account holders. He fled from Switzerland to France in 2008 with a list of 130,000 names of organisations and iniduals who were using secret Swiss accounts and handed them to French regulators.

She said she felt lifted by the choir of Notre Dame, who performed at the mass.Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said restoration work isn’t likely to begin until 2021 and described his heartache at not being able to celebrate Christmas services inside the cathedral.“Today it is not out of danger,” he told the Associated Press on the sidelines of Christmas Eve midnight mass. “It will be out of danger when we take out the remaining scaffolding.The 12th-century cathedral was under renovation at the time of the fire, which destroyed its roof and collapsed its spire. One of the toughest parts of the cleanup effort is cutting down the 50,000 tubes of old scaffolding that crisscrossed the back of the edifice.“We need to remove completely the scaffolding in order to make the building safe so in 2021 we will probably start the restoration of the cathedral,” Chauvet said. “Once the scaffolding is removed we need to assess the state of the cathedral, the quantity of stones to be removed and replaced.”He estimated it would take another three years after that to make it safe enough for people to re-enter the cathedral, but that the full restoration will take longer.The building had remained open for Christmas through two centuries – including the Nazi occupation in the second world war – being forced to close only during the anti-Catholic revolutionary period in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has set a timetable of five years to completely repair the 800-year-old building, which remains shrouded in scaffolding with a vast crane looming over it.Paris prosecutors suspect criminal negligence and opened an investigation in June, suggesting a stray cigarette butt or an electrical fault could be the culprit.The culture ministry said in October that nearly €1bn (£856m) had been pledged or raised for the reconstruction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc63b24d8533e7f008a24a691f667b1e50b1f03/0_134_3274_1965/master/3274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89d65305e7fd098e17336cdc5f1e3cdb","title":"philippines typhoon brings christmas day misery","story":"People stranded in evacuation centres and at ports as Typhoon Phanfone passes over string of islandsTyphoon Phanfone has pummelled the central Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet and miserable holiday season to millions. Thousands were stranded at shuttered ports or evacuation centres while others sheltered in rain-soaked homes as Phanfone crossed from one island to another for the second day.The typhoon toppled houses and trees and blacked out cities in the Philippines’ most storm-prone region. More than 10,000 people spent the night in schools, gyms and government buildings hastily converted into evacuation centres as the typhoon made landfall on Tuesday, civil defence officials said.“It was frightening. The glass windows shattered and we took cover by the stairs,” said Ailyn Metran after she and her four-year-old child spent the night at the local state weather service office where her husband worked. The family returned to their home in Tacloban city on Wednesday to find their two dogs safe but the floor was covered in mud and a fallen tree on their house.More islands lay in Phanfone’s projected path towards the South China Sea.More than 25,000 people trying to get home for the traditional Christmas Eve midnight dinner remained stranded at ports on Christmas Day with ferry services closed, the coast guard said. Scores of flights to the region also remained cancelled, though the capital Manila, on the northern edge, was being spared.Phanfone ravaged the north of the island of Cebu overnight on Tuesday, and residents decamped from evacuation centres only to find their homes damaged, civil defence official Allen Froilan Cabaron told AFP.“They were safer at the evacuation centres. At least they were able to eat the Christmas Eve meal there, even if only tinned fish and instant noodles were available,” Cabaron said. “Obviously, they were unable to celebrate Christmas properly because some spent the night at evacuation centres,” rescue official Cecille Bedonia said from Iloilo city.At the western island resort of Coron, the beaches emptied and boat tours were suspended as Western tourists stayed in their rooms to await the typhoon onslaught later on Thursday.“Many of the tourist establishments here are closed, and some of our guests failed to arrive because their flights were cancelled,” hotel receptionist Nina Edanosaid. “We’re not scared, but the ambience here is generally gloomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

It was facing Christmas without his dad that inspired him to invite others into the café. “This is kind of therapy for me,” he said.Emotion ran high through the building as communities gathered together in support of each other. For Nicola Thomas, “that’s what Christmas is about. It’s not about receiving, it’s giving.”Among those who arrived into Thomas and Co was Kevin Slattery who had been sitting in his flat by himself when he found out the café was open.Kevin had been homeless for many years before securing a flat in Oranmore two years ago with the help of the Simon Community.“I have a problem with drink. I find it very hard at Christmas not to go drinking and I usually get in trouble. The Gardaí are at the house or an ambulance is at the house,” Kevin said.However, this year Kevin left his empty flat and walked to Thomas and Co for some company. He said, “I can’t explain what this means. I’m just happy.”For Brazilian native, Anderson Morales, who has been living in Galway for fourteen years, Christmas can be difficult as he has no family here in Ireland.“You find a lot of people like me here,” he said, sitting among strangers conversing. “It kind of brings me a sense of family again.”Throngs of volunteers also arrived into the cafe, making coffees, washing dishes and providing musical entertainment.Gillian Mary Ni Chonbhui, who is a nurse and midwife, travelled from Clare to offer lifts to those who needed them and to provide friendly conversation.Meanwhile, Emma Howard along with her 15-year-old daughter came down to provide healthcare assistance to any elderly people or disabled people.The professional healthcare assistant esaid, “I thought it would be lovely for me to give back.

There were also Goal Miles in Houston, Texas, in Poland, in Umea in Sweden and with the Defence Forces in the Golan Heights.Whilst many Goal\u0026nbspMiles take place today there will be many rolling out between now and the New Year period.Last year Goal reached more than 5.5 million people in need around the world.

I am so grateful to every single person, who took the time to support the work of Goal.“The Goal\u0026nbspMile is now in its 38th year and has become a special and important tradition for families and communities. People come together and connect in a very special way and it’s wonderful to witness caring in action on such a large scale.Far from Home is the theme of our Xmas Campaign this year. I am grateful to all of the Goal\u0026nbspworkers who are far from home this Christmas caring for the millions of people who are displaced from their homelands through war, conflict, drought and extreme poverty.

They were first put up in anticipation of the March and April 2019 deadlines, and remained in place until June 11th.They were then dismantled as the OPW had no use for them ahead of a new Brexit deadline in October.They were then reinstalled on the October 21st, 2019 in preparation for the October 31st deadline.“They are likely to remain on site until the threat of a no deal passes, or if any changes are indicated following the British elections. On completion of the final phase of development of the new border control post on the site, expected by the end of January 2020, the marquees will be dismantled and returned,” a spokesman for the OPW said.According to the Government’s Brexit Contingency Plan, published in July 2019, infrastructure at ports was due to be “refined” and “improved” after the first deadline passed in March.It said that “permanent state inspection facilities will be constructed on a site adjacent to the existing port”.“This facility will accommodate inspection bays for SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) and food safety checks as well as a number of Revenue turnout sheds. The site will also include office accommodation, a documentary and public office, driver welfare facilities, two documentary and identity check facilities” and parking for 35 HGVs, the contingency plan states.Permanent infrastructureIn response to queries about the cost of the tents, a spokesman for the OPW said that “interim infrastructure was put in place at Rosslare Europort to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March 2019. In the period afforded by subsequent Brexit extensions, this has been enhanced incrementally since then. Permanent infrastructure will be put in place to apply the additional customs, SPS and health checks and controls on a long-term basis”.The OPW said the marquees had a “dual purpose for department staff training requirements and for use as emergency inspection accommodation for use in case of a no-deal Brexit”.The agency says it has already paid €110,400, excluding VAT, for the hire of the marquees with an indicative monthly rate of €27,600, excluding VAT.“The cost of their dismantling, removal from site and reinstallation in October 2019 was €8,500. We were not charged while the marquees were off-site.”A source has told The  that a large fence was also installed and removed at the site. The OPW said the costs for this are not available at this time.“The purpose of the moveable fencing was for site ision and security. Portions of the site were handed over to the client departments for training purposes as they became available. The moveable fencing is necessary to enable our main contractor to proceed with construction works safely, in parallel with department staff training and movements adjacent.“Given the area in question is an active construction site, moveable fencing is in place for the duration of the works for the safety and security of all parties.“The costs for fencing are incorporated into the main contract for the building of the border control post and will be available once the works are complete.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Stephen PondGetty ImagesBritain’s queen Elizabeth has had a trying year. She will admit as much, it seems, in her annual, prerecorded message that will be broadcast on Christmas Day, when she will call 2019 “quite bumpy,” according to excerpts released Tuesday by Buckingham Palace.Although it was not clear exactly what the queen was referring to, a quick overview of 2019 explains why it might have felt rough at times. In January, her husband, Prince Philip, apologised after he was involved in a car crash that left two women injured, sparking a public debate on older drivers. He agreed to relinquish his driver’s license.In August, the queen was dragged into British politics when UK prime minister Boris Johnson asked her to suspend parliament, a move that was later ruled unlawful by the country’s supreme court. A few weeks later, her grandson Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, went public about their emotional struggles in a candid interview filmed during their official tour of Africa. The couple’s environmental activism was questioned over their use of private jets, and Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, were unable to shake off headlines of a rumoured rift in their relationship.ChallengeBut the biggest challenge for the royal family came in November, when Prince Andrew, the queen’s second-oldest son, stepped down from his public duties after he gave a catastrophic interview to the BBC about his relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.“Quite bumpy” sounds less awful than “annus horribilis,” as she once called 1992 – the year when the marriages of three of her four children broke down, including that of prince Charles and princess Diana, and fire damaged Windsor Castle. But her description of 2019 makes clear that it has been tougher than 2018, which she characterised in last year’s Christmas broadcast simply as a “busy year.”The bumps of 2019 have continued into the final days of the year. After the queen recorded her message, Prince Philip (98), was admitted to a London hospital for what Buckingham Palace described as a precautionary measure to treat a preexisting condition. He left Tuesday, after spending four nights there.Although she is not expected to get into specifics in her address, the queen will focus on the importance of reconciliation – a notion that could apply both to her family and to Britain. The country, which has just emerged from a general election, has been scarred by isive politics surrounding the Brexit debate, including renewed calls for Scottish independence. –New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Berkeley Square should be allowded to grow \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 in order to save nightingales, Darwin\u0026#39s great great granddaughter saysThree members of British family die \u0026#39after drowning in swimming pool\u0026#39 at their Costa Del Sol hotelMurder investigation launched after man \u0026#39shot dead on his doorstep\u0026#39 in LondonDuke of York misses Royal family outing to Christmas Day church service at SandringhamIraq war veteran says \u0026#39I would rather go to The Hague than face another two years under UK investigation\u0026#39Soul-searching in Venezuela as Juan Guaido seeks re-electionPolice take over drug dealers’ phone numbers and text users in new fight against county lines gangs Accidents, feuds, the Epstein and Prince Andrew scandal... another annus horribilis for the QueenIt was Prince George and Princess Charlotte\u0026#39s first Christmas morning outside Sandringham church - and mine too Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special 2019, review: an irresistible festive treat with a touch of magic... in more ways than oneChristmas present drones could land parents with £1,000 fine, aviation regulator warnsEnglish Whiskey boom as distillery visits become most sort after activity on staycations Bank robber throws cash in air, shouting ‘Merry Christmas’Russia sends dissident to remote Arctic military baseAustralian firefighters continue to battle through ChristmasChina releases footage of live fire drills as it warns over fresh Hong Kong protestsDevelopers threaten to tear up Gerald Durrell\u0026#39s Greek paradiseQueen\u0026#39s Speech: Queen praises \u0026#39sense of purpose\u0026#39 among young climate change activists in Christmas broadcastPope tells Catholics: God loves \u0026#39even the worst of us\u0026#39, as Church embroiled in child abuse and financial scandals Syria begins shakedown of wealthiest businessmen as war debts spiralWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/25/TELEMMGLPICT000219841480_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"duchess cambridge posts new photograph family instagram christmas","story":"The Duke of Cambridge kisses Prince Louis while Princess Charlotte and Prince George smile for the cameraDuchess of CambridgeA new photograph taken by the Duchess of Cambridge has been released on Instagram as the family wished their 10.5 million followers a a very happy and relaxing Christmas Day.The black-and-white photograph, taken in Norfolk earlier this year, shows the Duke of Cambridge kissing Prince Louis on the cheek while Prince George and Princess Charlotte smile for the camera.The duchess is a keen photographer and was named as a patron of the Royal Photographic Society earlier this year.Kensington Palace has often published photos taken by the duchess that mark family birthdays and milestones as the young royals grow up.In 2015, the duchess took the first official portraits of Princess Charlotte, rather than hiring a photographer.The duchess\u0026#39s portrait of Prince LouisYesterday, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex released their Christmas card with their young son Archie taking centre stage.It included the message Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, adding from our family to yours.

the theme of her Christmas Day broadcast.The Queen said the Christmas message of peace and goodwill still has relevance today - a comment which follows a year of bitter debates in Parliament and the country over Brexit.She said the message was a reminder of what can be achieved when people abandon their differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.Her words are likely to be interpreted as an appeal for the healing of isions in the country as Britain leaves the EU.The Queen said in her message: The challenges many people face today may be different to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.Ms Thunberg\u0027s activism has sparked a global climate strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters across the world protest by refusing to go to classes.She addressed a UN summit on the issue in September, telling world leaders they had failed to act.You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, she said.Her efforts were acknowledged by the Duke of Cambridge who said climate activists were ringing the planetary alarm bell louder.The Queen also spoke about personal joy, describing how she and the Duke of Edinburgh were delighted to welcome an eighth great-grandchild to their family - Harry and Meghan\u0027s son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - born 200 years after Queen Victoria.As the Queen spoke viewers saw a photograph, released a few days after Archie\u0027s birth on May 6, which captured the moment she and the Duke of Edinburgh saw Archie for the first time as his proud parents and grandmother Doria Ragland looked on.The Christmas message, produced by the BBC, was recorded in Windsor Castle\u0027s green drawing room after the General Election but before Philip was admitted to a private London hospital for treatment for a pre-existing but undisclosed condition.The duke spent four nights being treated before he was discharged on Christmas Eve morning, in time to join the royal family celebrations at Sandringham.In her message to the country and Commonwealth the Queen mentioned the carol It Came Upon The Midnight Clear - performed at the end of the broadcast.She added: Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels\u0027 message of peace and goodwill.It\u0027s a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it\u0027s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.A string of milestones marked during 2019 were mentioned by the Queen, from the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings to the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing.She began her address by highlighting its theme of small steps as she spoke about the Apollo 11 mission.As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind, said the Queen.She added: It\u0027s a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps.The Queen on Christmas DayNearby was a picture of the Queen meeting Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.Speaking about D-Day, the Queen mentioned the look of concern on my father\u0027s face as King George VI knew about the secret plans but could not share that burden.Seventy-five years on from the historic landings, she said former enemies had met in friendship at commemorations marking the anniversary in Britain and on the continent.The Queen added: Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.By being willing to put past differences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.During the broadcast footage was shown of America\u0027s moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the alliance\u0027s 70th anniversary.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patrick\u0027s Day with the Irish Guards.Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences, the Queen added: Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps.The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference.The Queen\u0027s comment about experiencing a bumpy year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past 12 months.During 2019, the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation safe and secure.At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legion\u0027s Together at Christmas initiative.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe research builds on previous studies that uncovered a correlation between bitcoin\u0027s price and Google searches relating to cryptocurrency.However, the most recent data we\u0027ve analysed here show Google searches for \u0027bitcoin\u0027 peaking before holidays, not after. Regardless of which forces are really driving bitcoin\u0027s holiday behaviour, it seems as though bitcoin remains sensitive to major US holidays for the time being.Other cryptocurrencies also experienced positive price movements over the weekend, including ether\u0026nbsp(ethereum), XRP (ripple) and bitcoin cash. These altcoins are even more prone to huge price swings than the notoriously volatile bitcoin.Historically this has been a time when traders do look at altcoins and therefore volatility may increase, Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm Luno, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Analysis of the latest price increase led some cryptocurrency analysts to predict further gains over the coming days.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes.

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film. When he is in the hanger on the runway it is N3035C, but once it’s flying, the numbers change to N3413F.829 The Wizard of Oz (1939)Judy Garland isn’t wearing her iconic ruby red slippers in the scene where the trees pelt Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples. Instead, she can be seen wearing plain black shoes.The baby that Bradley Cooper holds while adapting to civilian life after the Iraqi War is plastic. In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top. Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error. Ridley Scott finally fixed this and other mistakes with his 2007 Final Cut.John Carpenter’s slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis was set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, but all the cars have Californian number plates and there are shots of palm trees, as the film was shot in Southern California.At the end of the cult film, Data tells news reporters that the octopus was really scary, but this actually refers to a deleted scene.

It is clearly daylight, but suddenly, after the police chase, it’s pitch black.When Jack (Leonardi DiCaprio) is painting a naked Rose (Kate Winslet) and tells her to go over by the bed, and then says he means the couch, it was DiCaprio flubbing his lines. But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum. One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film.

In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”.

Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Student housing charity Unipol says up to 2,000 students have faced disruption this year.\u0026nbspFigures from the charity show that 23 private student accommodation blocks being built across the UK were not completed in time for the start of term, compared with\u0026nbsp13 developments last year.Dylan Thomson, deputy president of Liverpool Guild of Students, said students were left “stressed and anxious” when they were told just a day before moving that their rooms would not be ready.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHundreds of students were affected by delays to two private student accommodation blocks in the city. Mr Thomson told The Independent: “Many of the students were first years and already feeling nervous. Disruption in the first few weeks of university life, which is already a stressful period, was made worse.\u0026nbsp“This left some students feeling unsettled and isolated which made it difficult to find friends.”Durham students put into temporary accommodation days before arrivingMeanwhile, in Portsmouth a group of students were placed in hotels a 30-minute drive from the university following delays to private accommodation at the start of term.\u0026nbspSome students in the city have been moved three times – and a few are still in temporary rooms three months after the start of term, Helena Schofield, president of Portsmouth Students’ Union, said.\u0026nbspShe added: “It has affected their studies as they have spent a lot of time emailing private companies and it has been really unsettling and distressing for them.”The rise in students affected by building delays this year comes amid huge expansion across universities.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay up to £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population at a time when student numbers at institutions are uncapped.Kate McIntosh, president of the students’ union at Durham University, where 108 students were placed in temporary accommodation this term amid delays, said: “At the university, and in the sector as a whole, there needs to be serious questions asked about where student welfare comes into the conversation when we’re talking about building works and expansion.“The university is committed to expanding and building new colleges but at the first hurdle they have fallen because they’ve had over 100 students not in their bed at freshers’ week. It is a complete failure.”The data, obtained by\u0026nbspThe Independent, shows that universities have offered students fruit hampers and supermarket and laundry vouchers to make up for accommodation delays.\u0026nbspBut the National Union of Students (NUS) says institutions need to do more. Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at NUS, said: “There should be mandatory compensation. It is not really a gift if you are giving someone laundry vouchers when the flat they were meant to have had a washing machine.”She told The Independent: “A lot of universities are trying to abdicate their responsibility of accommodation for students. They act like it’s only private providers problems.“Universities are making a lot of money from the fees students are paying but they are not putting that money into building the infrastructure to support the number of students they are then going to house.”Student plans commute from Amsterdam to Bristol amid housing shortageMs Crossan Jory added: “Universities need to realise it’s not just a person sitting in a classroom – it’s all that goes along with moving to a new city or town and having to live somewhere.”In October, universities minister Chris Skidmore urged student accommodation providers to come together to ensure “failures” did not happen again following reports of delays across the UK.\u0026nbspA Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said the organisation was aware of the issues and challenges surrounding student accommodation and was “working to address them”.The spokesperson said: “To address some immediate challenges, particularly around consumer protections, we need to explore where strengthening regulation can help and make clear where responsibilities lie for accommodation quality and welfare.“It is important that all providers – whether the accommodation is university-owned and managed or run by private sector organisations – meet high standards, demonstrate value, take into account the mental health and wellbeing of students and are accountable to students.”Mr Skidmore said: “Students pay significant amounts for accommodation and housing can affect student welfare.“That is why providers who fail to complete projects on time – and provide adequate alternative provision – need to be held accountable.“With the number of students expected to rise sharply due to demographic changes in the 2020s, we must sharpen our focus on how we will deliver and regulate student accommodation in the years to come.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”.

For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. “As humans we are imperfect,” he can be heard saying in a teaser “super trailer” for his 2020 plans.“My past, my mistakes, all the things that I\u0027ve been through… I believe that I\u0027m right where I\u0027m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me.”The promo video finds Bieber, wearing his trademark baggy hoodie and woolly hat, sitting outside a petrol station and wandering around a trailer park near Los Angeles as he contemplates his next move.Ariana Grande releases new live album ‘k bye for now’The 50 best albums of 2019Justin Bieber shares contrite Instagram message about personal growthEarlier this year, Bieber wrote about his struggles with drug use and depression in an emotional essay, in which he described himself as “the most hated person in the world”.“I feel like this is different from the previous albums just because of where I\u0027m at with my life,” he goes on in the video. “I\u0027m excited to perform it and to tour it.“We all have different stories, I\u0027m just excited to share mine.

It does not reveal which animals were involved or other details.The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and Public Health England (PHE), both based in Wiltshire, received sums for five projects: three of $3,500, one of $4,140 and one of $1,680 for projects from 2017 to 2024, looking into infectious diseases using animals.University College London dropped plans to carry out procedures involving sheep and rabbits, electrically stimulating their nerves to find treatments for human conditions such as epilepsy and arthritis, which originally involved an NIH grant application of $776,000.Researchers from the University of Bath worked on medicinal chemistry with counterparts in the US who received funding to make rhesus monkeys addicted to heroin, cocaine and alcohol.Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedSome of the studies, aimed at finding ways to prevent people who have come off opioids and cocaine from relapsing, involved testing the efficacy of preventive drugs on the animals.The grants did not go to Bath scientists but to those at the University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, who fitted the animals with catheters, allowing them to self-administer drugs.The White Coat Waste project says it tried to launch an advertising campaign about the monkey testing, but the adverts were banned by authorities.The watchdog group gathers its information from government databases, freedom of information requests, members of congress, whistleblowers, official websites and scientific publications.Anthony Bellotti, founder and president, said: “It’s high time to stop shipping hardworking Americans’ money to the UK for nonsense like hooking fish on nicotine and addicting primates to heroin.“Most Americans oppose animal testing, and with a nearly-trillion-dollar deficit and so many US scientists who can’t find jobs in their fields, there’s no excuse for sending American tax dollars overseas to abuse animals and enrich foreign iniduals and institutions.”A spokeswoman for Queen Mary University of London said: “Medical research at world-class universities like Queen Mary saves and enhances the lives of millions of people worldwide, with breakthroughs often coming as a result of research involving animals.US government vows to continue controversial experiments on dogs“Indeed, UK law requires that all medicines should be tested in at least two different species of live animals before their use in humans.“However, it is important that animals are used for research only when it is absolutely necessary and no alternative is available. In this case, the genetic characteristics that zebrafish share with mammals provide insights that could help scientists to develop treatments for addiction in humans.”Work is overseen by an animal welfare and ethical review body, she said.Oxford University said most of its biomedical research used animal alternatives, adding: “Sadly, we are not yet at the point where these techniques or computer modelling could entirely replace the need for animal research.“The university has consistently been at the forefront of innovative and life-saving science. Our research provides vital insight into cancer, strokes, heart disease, diabetes, HIV, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and many more diseases that cause suffering and death.”A spokesman said researchers commit to replacing animals, reducing numbers used and refining experiments to ensure animals suffer as little as possible, he said.\u0026nbspA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “DSTL is responsible for developing new vaccines, therapies and treatments that can save military lives and benefit civilians and which could not, currently, be achieved without the use of animals in research.“DSTL is committed to reducing the number of animal experiments and only applies for licences if the research aims cannot be achieved without animal experiments.”A PHE spokesman said: “Most of our research is carried out without involving animals however, some remains essential to understand how infections are transmitted and to prevent the spread of disease, as well as studying how environmental factors affect human health.” PHE has signed up to the Concordat on Openness in Animal Research, he said.The three UK universities receiving funding have also signed the concordat.A University of Bath spokesman said it did not conduct animal experiments with non-human primates, adding: “We conduct biomedical research aimed at understanding disease and developing new drugs, including new treatments for opioid abuse. We work with small rodents and some fish species.”Heptares Therapeutics has also been approached for comment.A statement by NIH said all animals used in research it funds are protected by laws, regulations, and policies “to ensure the smallest possible number of subjects and the greatest commitment to their welfare”. Institutions receiving funds must follow the Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the statement said.It added that foreign grant recipients must provide NIH with an assurance and certification of compliance with laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted, and a pledge to follow the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. NIH “encourages foreign recipients to use the standards in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”.

About £4m had been paid in compensation to people affected by the prior ban, according to an internal MoD report.This month an MoD spokesperson told The Independent: “We are aware of fewer than 200 cases in which iniduals may have been dismissed on the grounds of their sexuality, although we accept that there may be cases that aren’t known about.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Swimmers of the Serpentine Swimming Club take part in the Peter Pan Cup race, which is held every Christmas Day at the Serpentine, in central LondonShoppers bid for cuts of meat during a Christmas Eve auction in Smithfield market in LondonReggie the dog is rescued with a boat from flooding at the Little Venice Country Park and Marina in MaidstonePeople gather at Stonehenge in Wiltshire to mark the winter solstice, and to witness the sunrise after the longest night of the yearSouthampton\u0027s Jack Stephens scores their second goal against Aston VillaThe coffin arrives for the funeral of London Bridge terror attack victim Jack Merritt at Great St Mary\u0027s Church in CambridgeQueen Elizabeth II and her son Prince Charles walk behind the Imperial State Crown as they proccess through the Royal Gallery, before the Queen\u0027s Speech, during the State Opening of ParliamentLuke Jerram\u0027s art installation \u0027Gaia\u0027, a replica of planet earth created using detailed Nasa imagery of the Earth\u0027s surface, hangs on display at the Eden Project in St Austell, CornwallA surfer gets into the festive spirit at the inland surfing lagoon at The Wave, near BristolSnowy conditions near Deepdale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park as snow hits parts of the UKOisin Carson, 5, picks a Christmas tree at Wicklow Way Christmas tree farm in RoundwoodFirst Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, takes a selfie as she joins the SNPs newly elected MPs for a group photo outside the V\u0026ampA Museum in Dundee, ScotlandPrime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds arrive back at Downing Street after the results for the general election were announced.

In 2007-08 alone, the MoD settled a tranche of 57 cases a further 20 were concluded between 2003 and 2010. Overall, 159 claims were made, with some rejected and others withdrawn, the FoI response said.It comes just weeks after the government admitted it had treated former royal navy radio operator Joe Ousalice “in a way that would not be acceptable today” when he was forced out of the senior service in 1993.Falklands War veteran Mr Ousalice, who is bisexual, was also stripped of a long service and good conduct medal when he was discharged. The award will now be returned to him, following court action that concluded earlier this month.Other former service members can apply for medals lost in similar circumstances to be reinstated.The MoD spokesman added: “Any iniduals who forfeited a medal in connection with an offence, for which they are able to obtain a disregard under the terms of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, will need to apply for the restoration of the medal under the terms of the policy being operated by the Cabinet Office.“Cases will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ministers should be doing all they can to put this right.”In a written answer to a parliamentary question in January, defence minister Tobias Ellwood said that “since the lifting of the ban on LGBT personnel serving in the military in the year 2000, the MoD has welcomed and supported all personnel, irrespective of sexual orientation, actively celebrating and supporting the ersity of all our personnel.”He added: “Support is available including through LGBT champions, senior LGBT role models, active LGBT networks and over 150 personnel trained by Stonewall as LGBT allies.”All three branches of the forces are ranked by Stonewall, a leading campaign group, as among its top 100 employers.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Of these, almost two thirds (1,152) are people seeking asylum in the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast year, 1,784 people were in immigration detention centres at Christmas.The vast majority (1,506) of the 1,800 people in detention are being held in Home Office immigration removal centres\u0026nbsp– while\u0026nbsp300 are being detained in prison.Home Office asylum detentions ruled unlawful as appeal dismissedTwenty-seven people have been kept in detention for more than a year, and three people for more than two years. Almost\u0026nbspone in 10 have been held for at least six months.The government has come under fire over its treatment of asylum seekers and other immigrants at detention centres, particularly since the Windrush scandal.Last year, women at one of the main detention centres, Yarl’s Wood\u0026nbspin Bedfordshire, went on hunger strike in protest at the conditions.Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the government’s detention of many asylum seekers was unlawful,\u0026nbsppaving the way for a slew of new compensation claims against the\u0026nbspHome Office that could run to millions of pounds.Keeping people in immigration detention centres costs the taxpayer\u0026nbsp£89m a year, and last year the Home Office was forced to pay £8.2m in compensation for 312 cases of wrongful detention.The overall number of people in immigration detention centres has decreased in recent years, and has more than halved since the end of 2014, when 3,439 people were being held.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost two thousand people will spend Christmas separated from their loved ones, as they remain indefinitely imprisoned in a detention centre.“Locking vulnerable people up with no idea of when they will be released is yet another part of the Conservative government’s toxic and hostile approach to immigration. It is time the Tories gained some humanity and stopped wasting tax payers money on ensuring people spend their Christmas languishing in cells.“The Liberal Democrats believe detention centres should only ever be a last resort. It’s time the Tories listened, introduced a 28-day limit on detention, and shut the majority of the UK’s detention centres.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But some inidual stories have also had the power to elicit what feels like a global response.Here are some of the wildest, most tragic, and most endearing stories of the last decade – the times when it felt impossible not to follow the story.No sooner had the decade begun than\u0026nbspEyjafjallajökull erupted – prompting travel chaos, an apocalyptic atmosphere and a pronunciation challenge for non-Icelandic newsreaders everywhere.Having laid dormant since 1823, the eruption, in the south of Iceland, saw ash shoot 30,000 feet into the air, creating a dark cloud that quite literally hung over Europe and caused the widest disruption to air travel since WWII.Over a period of six days, hundreds of locals were evacuated and tens of thousands of flights were cancelled.Created with Sketch.Best pictures of the decade Show all 72Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters flee from tear gas fired by riot police during clashes after protesters removed a concrete barrier at Qasr al-Aini Street near Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt on 24 JanuaryAmid tight security, members of the public arrive to pay their respects at the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard \u0027Tignous\u0027 Verlhac at Pere Lachaise Cemetery on January 15  in Paris, France.

By the time the vessel arrived in Immingham, it was clear that this was the worst crisis in European aviation since the dark days following 911.The following days were characterised by stories of desperate travellers, growing frustration at what was increasingly seen as a gross overreaction, and various airlines failing to respect their obligations under European air passengers’ rights rules.”In the first but by no means the last enthralling cave disaster of the decade, 33 men became trapped for a staggering 69 days after a collapse at the copper and gold mine in which they worked.A true testament to the strength of the human spirit, the miners sent videos to the surface via a mini-camera, and were saidTheir eventual rescue, after two months, involved Nasa, and was watched by over a billion people worldwide, according to Chile’s state broadcaster - but it did take 23 hours.Mexican film-maker Patricia Riggen directed the 2016 film, The 33, and tells The Independent why the story spoke to her.“The idea of brotherhood was what drove me to tell this story. That is why I find these 33 men admirable.“And the world united in that moment to make this true miracle of humanity and technology and chance happen. It was the fact that they kept it together under the worst circumstances ever imagined, and helped each other, that they were able to stay alive.“And above ground people did the same, uniting forces, bringing everyone together: government, technology, resources, the love of the families, and the faith that they were still alive.“I love telling stories about the human spirit. About the best we have in ourselves. About humanity, which for me is the ability to rise to the circumstances and reach beyond ourselves for a greater good— to help a loved one, or a complete stranger. This is what makes life truly worth living. It’s what makes us humans. The Chilean miner’s story is one that we can all be proud of as humans.”Its modern image created largely in the shadow of the devastating twin atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan found itself victim to another nuclear crisis - this one triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake.That tremor and subsequent tsunami killed over 15,000 people and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant - displacing hundreds of thousands of people. This was a modern-day Chernobyl, in the internet era. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) which operated the plant, spent months denying a meltdown had occurred, and public mistrust remains high. In September of this year, the Japanese government announced it might have to soon release one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea.Fukushima, four years on: inside the town the world forgotIn November 2011, eight months after the accident, journalists were, for the first time, allowed to visit the site.Writing for The New York Times, Martin Fackler wrote that:“About three dozen journalists sat on two buses. We wore protective suits, double gloves, double layers of clear plastic booties over shoes, hair covers, respirator masks, and carried radiation detectors. As we drove to the Fukushima plant, we passed through a police checkpoint, and saw three towns – Naraha, Tomioka, Okuma – empty of all inhabitants. Among the abandoned homes was a flower shop with plants, withered and dead, still on display.At the base of the reactor buildings, there were crumpled trucks, contorted metal girders and frames of buildings, a huge storage tank dented and bent, and pipes twisted by the forces of nature. The damage reached up to the second storey, attesting to the tsunami\u0027s 14-metre size. A four metre-high sea wall has been built with rocks in black nets. Tepco said it was a makeshift defence against another tsunami. The reading here was 300ms.The nuclear crisis minister, Goshi Hosono, came to address the men here. “Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved,” he said. “This is due to your hard work.” He said he is aiming for a cold shutdown by the end of the year. All good news, then? Not quite. There are still 30 years of work after that, he said, referring to the dismantling of the reactors.”In what would become a defining moment of Barack Obama’s presidency, and after 10 years in hiding, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was located to a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Killed and buried at sea, the circumstances of his death were a foreshadow of the 2019 killing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - likely also to become one of Donald Trump’s key legacies.Sohaib Athar, a software expert, had recently moved to Abbottabad, in the eastern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, and inadvertently live-tweeted witnessing the May 2011 raid on bin Laden’s compound, conducted by Seal Team Six.He tells The Independent he has no regrets about tweeting that night.Crowds gather in US cities after Bin Laden killed“I was mostly amused - not by the raid of course, that was serious stuff - but by the irony of moving from Lahore to Abbottabad for some peace and quiet and landing in the middle of an international incident.“I don’t regret tweeting that night - it gave me a fresh perspective on how the multiple sides of a story are perceived by people from different parts of the world, and how easy it is for all sides involved to force a certain narrative on the world by a deliberate choice of words and cherry-picking.“I live in Islamabad now, but still have a tiny home in Abbottabad, and my coffee shop is still operational, so I visit every few months.“The media coverage that the incident received, and is still receiving, enforced an image of Pakistan that is reinforced at every \u0027anniversary\u0027. Pakistan is a mostly normal country if events are not sensationalised disproportionately. Abbottabad moved on a couple of weeks after the incident, the rest of the world still calls it news.”On 12 January, 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, on the Caribbean island of Hiiola.Already suffering from decades of political and economic turmoil - 70 per cent of the population was living under the poverty line at the time - the devastating tremor killed a quarter of a million people, and left a further 1.5 million living in makeshift camps.Naromie Marline Joseph Fatal, a psychological support worker with MSF in Haiti, tells The Independent about that day, and the months and years that followed.“I experienced the earthquake the same way that everyone else did, I was helpless. I thought that an atomic bomb had gone off, the noise was so loud.Huge toll feared in Haiti earthquake“I saw buildings and trees collapsing, one after another… and the hospital, a five-storey building, was trembling. I couldn’t go anywhere - I lay down on the floor and clenched my fists. God, help me!, I prayed.“In the days that followed, tractors picked up bodies as if they were rubbish. Four years later I spoke to a psychologist myself, to chase those images away.“After the earthquake… psychological support was needed on a massive scale. The level of need was huge – there were bereaved parents, depressed people, the shock of the deaths.“I began working full time with MSF, as they were the only organisation who were taking care of people with psychiatric needs. It needs to be said that what happened pushed people who were already fragile over the edge.“It was an event that touched all of humanity, 300,000 dead is unthinkable. International aid and media attention were particularly strong over the five years following the earthquake.“We’ve heard a lot of talk about reconstruction. Me, I haven’t seen it yet. We’re still waiting.For those who had seen Lost, the story seemed eerily familiar - so I’m told. Had the plane actually disappeared?But despite the best efforts of Malaysian authorities to insist the plane would be found, and all 227 passengers and 12 crew were still alive, it was soon clear this was either a tragic accident or mass murder.Again, Simon Calder reflects on this truly mysterious event.“Before 8 March 2014, aviation had a long history of planes disappearing mysteriously. But none was on the scale of MH370.The Malaysia Airlines jet had taken off from Kuala Lumpur on a routine flight to Beijing. The first the world knew that anything was wrong what when air-traffic controllers in Vietnam were unable to make contact with the Boeing 777. After some fictitious reports that it had landed in southern China with technical problems, MH370 was declared missing and presumed to have crashed in the South China Sea.The manifest showed there was 239 people on board (though some say there may have been at least one more, hiding in an under-floor bay before perpetrating an act of mass murder).For a week, rescuers conducted a fruitless search in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam. Then, at a dramatic press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced that the aircraft had remained aloft for hours after it disappeared. An analysis of automated signals by Inmarsat revealed the 777 must have flown along one of two arcs: northwest across southern China towards the Caspian Sea, or south across the Indian Ocean to an area west of Australia.The authorities concluded that the former was impossible without the plane being spotted, and Australia took control of the search operation. From an air force base north of Perth, reconnaissance flights begin of the presumed crash area. Plans were made for an unprecedented, and ultimately unsuccessful, sweep of the ocean floor. Fragments of the aircraft started washing up on Indian Ocean beaches – though analysis of the species of barnacles that had grown up on the aircraft’s “flaperon” failed to help locate the wreckage.One person very close to the saga believes the plane will be found in the southern Indian Ocean once undersea drone technology makes it feasible to deploy 100 or more unmanned devices to plumb the depths for signs of former life.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Women of the Decade, 2010-2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In September 2018, psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, when she was 15 years old.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can WhatsApp us on   But he said that the number of downlights hadnt been a drawback for the buyer.It is understood the property was built by an overzealous builder who was passionate about his TV and music.It comes after the seller, Devang Gandhi, told The Sun Online he hadnt expected such an interest in the property after it was listed.He said: The sockets are very handy because you dont have to pull the cables.Wherever you want to stick in the plug, you can stick it in for the TV, DVDs, stereos.The strange abundance of outlets came to light when Twitter user Toby Davies shared the Rightmove link to the property sold by estate agents Andrew Pearce - sarcastically adding: Thinking about buying this house, but Im not sure it has enough plug sockets.On Rightmove, the property is described as a: Family haven situated in a family-friendly location.The accommodation briefly comprises of a bright and spacious entrance hallway with doors leading to all rooms.The dining room enjoys a bay window adding a natural flow of light into the property.The kitchen, dubbed stunning, includes a range of eye and base level units including integrated appliances, a breakfast bar and lots of natural light.With no mention of the ridiculous amount of plug sockets and downlighters, Twitter users took it into their own hands to figure out why the house was filled with outlets.One user wrote: Were they running the CIA from the front room Another witty user quipped: Was this an electricians training centre at one point Others wondered about the price of the owners electricity bill. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitter  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders. But this is a serious crime meriting jail every time.And when so many routine tasks now require ID, one as vital to our democracy as casting your ballot certainly should.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say. Clearly Sharon is happy with the work she has had done and she looks great.Some people, we would say, grow old gracefully. But why,you would rather not I wish I had the courage to have it all done, too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER!

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children.

You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be.

Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.”Mr Shawcross was previously Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.Boris is such a joy as PM! He has such enthusiasm, he is so bold, he has such marvelous and often funny turns of phrase, and he has such great instincts.Take for example his  minute film greetings to the Jewish people, released yesterday on the feast of Hanukah. It is exuberant, funny, important and very moving.Celebrating Jewishness, Boris said: “ Its really important right now because I know that recent years have not been easy ones for British Jews.“In the media, on the streets and specially online, Anti-Semites in alarming numbers have been emboldened to crawl out from under their rocks and begin to spread their brand of noxious hatred.He did not mention the Labour Party but he did not have to. It is out from under Labour rocks that some of the most vicious British anti-Semites have crawled.Labour used to be the natural home of Britain’s small but hugely vibrant Jewish community of some ,.But since Corbyn became leader, that once great party has been mired in hideous anti-Semitism.The Jewish Labour Movement, affiliated to Labour for almost a hundred years, stated in a recent terrying report, that “Antisemitic behaviour is pervasive at all levels” of Corbyn’s Labour.The report said that the abuse used by some Labour members against Jews - “cockroaches, subhumans, a cancer on the world” was reminiscent of Nazi Germany.Imagine - Dame Margaret Hodge the veteran Jewish MP for Barking said that she faced ”much more” anti-Semitism from the Labour Party than from the BNP !All in all, Jews were so frightened of Labour before the election that % of those polled said they would leave the countryCorbyn won.They would have been wise.Boris’s moving encouragement to British Jews show that he is clearly determined to make them feel at home in the wake of Corbyn’s stunning and very welcome defeat.In his convivial manner, praising the feast Hanukah, he said that he recently had the joy of baking a few latkes and doughnuts when he visited Golders Green during the election.And he pointed out, “Who can argue with a festival where the kids get presents every day of the week.More seriously, he said it was not only the moment to celebrate the miracle of Hanukah itself, “But also your unique identity… to put the Hanukah menorah in the window and say to the world … I am Jewish and I am proud of it.“And that’s really important right now.”Boris is right. If Labour had won, Jews would have been frightened to proclaim their identity.Boris by contrast celebrates it with them.“As you kindle the Hanukah light tonight and in the nights to come I want you to remember this….As Britain’s Jews seek to drive back the darkness of resurgent anti-Semitism….you have every decent person in this country fighting by your side.”Why “ Because Britain would not be Britain without its Jewish community.“And we will stand with you and celebrate with you all year round.”This speech is only two minutes but it is a work of genius. All my Jewish friends are stunned by it – by his humour, his knowledge of their history and his total, positive embrace of their cause.They no longer feel alone and abused.I doubtany Jews will leave now. If the polls are correct, well over , might have fled Corbynism.Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.

It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.Her Majesty then highlighted how todays generation follows a similar sense of purpose when it comes to climate change and thanked the men and women of the armed forces and emergency services for their sacrices.She said: The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.My family and I are also inspired by the men and women of our emergency services and armed forces and at Christmas we remember all those on duty at home and abroad, who are helping those in need and keeping us and our families safe and secure.Prince Andrew isnt the only royal missing the photographs on show during the speech.Prince Harry and Meghans photo is also missing as its reported they celebrating Christmas in Canada.The rest of the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge along with their children on display.As a child, I never imagined that one day a man would walk on the moon. Yet this year we marked the th anniversary of the famous Apollo  mission.As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind. Its a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps.This year we marked another important anniversary: D-Day. On th June , some , British, Canadian and American forces landed in northern France. It was the largest ever seabourne invasion and was delayed due to bad weather.I well remember the look of concern on my fathers face. He knew the secret D-Day plans but could of course share that burden with no one.For the th anniversary of that decisive battle, in a true spirit of reconciliation, those who had formally been sworn enemies came together in friendly commemorations either side of the Channel, putting past dferences behind them.Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.My family and I are also inspired by the men and women of our emergency services and armed forces and at Christmas we remember all those on duty at home and abroad, who are helping those in need and keeping us and our families safe and secure.Two hundred years on from the birth of my great, great grandmother, Queen Victoria, Prince Philip and I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great grandchild into our family.Of course, at the heart of the Christmas story lies the birth of a child: a seemingly small and insignicant step overlooked by many in Bethlehem.But in time, through his teaching and by his example, Jesus Christ would show the world how small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences and deep-seated isions to bring harmony and understanding.Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference.As Christmas dawned, church congregations around the world joined in singing It Came Upon The Midnight Clear.Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels message of peace and goodwill.Its a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, its worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.And so, I wish you all a very happy Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Royal Engineer Jimmy Preston – who has been in the army for  years – was originally told he wouldnapost make it home by Christmas. He was meant to be in the middle of a seven-month tour with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards until April.But the Irvine dad-of-three phoned his we Claire and told her he’d be home for December , so they got to work on making a plan to surprise little Emma, Brooke and Leland, reports the Daily Record. They planned to go to Santa’s Grotto at Riverside Lodge Hotel in Irvine, organised by CJ Party Hire, but the kids had no idea their dad would also be there. Claire filmed the special moment as dad Jimmy appeared from behind Santa’s chair with the kids overwhelmingly excited to see him. The video was a big hit online, and Claire and Jimmy were both delighted with the reaction. Claire told the Irvine Herald: “We were told there would be no leave, meaning he wouldn’t be home until April. “So the kids were prepared for him coming home then, but he got given an earlier date. “He missed Christmas two years ago, so the kids knew how it felt and they were preparing for it again. “It wasn’t nice that year, so it was a great surprise for him to come home this time.  “He phoned me and said that he should be home before Christmas. “We decided not to tell the kids, because it may have ended up that he still had to stay. “So we kept it a secret just in case. “We had a think about how we were going to reveal it to the kids, so we decided that Santa’s Grotto was a good idea. “I contacted Riverside Lodge Hotel in Irvine and it was CJ Party Hire who organised the grotto. “We told them our idea and they loved it, they helped plan it all.

A study of , adults found tins, condiments, herbs and spices amount to £ of the unused goods, but even the freezer is home to £ of produce. Brits admit they have at least four food items in the kitchen they have no idea how to use - with many of the ingredients and sauces left unopened, or used once, bought for unusual recipes or on a whim. One in five adults attribute a lack of food planning as the main reason for their food wastage - or hunger getting the better of them, forcing them into impulse purchases on the day. Overestimating portions and having to buy ingredients that come in excessively large packaging are also major contributors to food waste at home in the UK. While many are hoarding ingredients,  per cent feel a sense of guilt due to the amount of food wasted in their household - throwing away nearly £ of food each week. Laurent Guillemain, CEO of HelloFresh UK, which commissioned the study, said: Weaposre seeing many people overspend on ingredients that they never use and ultimately have to throw away which is bad for their wallets and the environment. Our research shows that double the amount of food is thrown out over the festive period. As many look to waste and spend less in the new year, HelloFresh is an ideal choice for dinner - delivering all the pre-portioned ingredients needed to cook chef inspired recipes from scratch at home. The study also found more than six in  Brits enjoy cooking, but nearly a quarter donapost clean their fridge or freezer for at least six months, with some leaving it up to a year before having a clear out.  When Brits eventually make the time to have a clean-up, nearly £ worth of food has to be thrown in the bin. And while rummaging through their frozen goods, the average Brit finds food that has been kept in the freezer for nearly two years. It also emerged dinner leftovers, fruit and veg and bread are the most frequently thrown away perishables, with more than half of Brits binning them in an average week. Old classics like pasta, tinned tuna, baked beans and rice make up some of the many products stored for in excess of a month in our cupboards - as well as other long-le products such as flour, herbs and spices.

A survey of , UK adults found four in  wish they had dferent Boxing Day plans, with  per cent doing the same things year in, year out. More than a third of adults normally host or visit close family for a second day of celebrations while one in  are usually dragged around the sales.And one in five build up to putting together another big Christmas dinner .But exactly  per cent agree their aposperfectapos December  would be spent in their local watching endless games of footie. A quarter would rather spend their time meeting up with friends and  per cent would just like to curl up with the dog all day. Chris Conchie, head of sport at pub company and brewer Greene King, which commissioned the research to celebrate a huge Boxing Day of sport, said: While Christmas is certainly a time for family, after being stuck in the house for days on end many people feel a break to see friends in the pub will be welcomed by the th December. Boxing Day is a great opportunity to escape for a few hours and catch up on the sport, and more than  Greene King pubs will be showing the Boxing Day Premier League fixtures on Amazon Prime, so weaposre expecting to see lots of post-Christmas sports fans. If you donapost normally visit the pub over Christmas this could be a break from the norm, and the perfect way to save getting stuck in a festive rut after the big day is over. According to the study, some of Britsapos biggest Boxing Day grumbles include enduring the same old films on TV , the house being a messand feeling a desperate need to exercise .  Another  per cent complain about being forced to play endless board games like Monopoly all day long. The same amount struggle to maintain cordial relationships with family members, while one in  get fed up with having to spend all day building complicated kidsapos toys. More than a tenth also confess to experiencing aposcabin feverapos after spending too long rattling around the same house. It also emerged adults will spend nearly four hours slumped in front of the TV on Boxing Day, after cleaning for an hour and a half. Theyaposll also have to drive for half an hour to visit seven dferent relatives, friends or neighbours, according to the OnePoll survey. For Brits who are able to escape to the pub this Boxing Day,  per cent hope to actually spend all day there.  Theyaposd like to sink four pints, get through four portions of chips and three packs of nuts while they catch the seasonal sports.Chris Conchie added: There are loads of great sporting fixtures taking place on Boxing Day this year.Most notable is the top-of-the-table clash between Leicester City and Liverpool at pm, but there are lots of other big games as well. Almost the whole league will be represented, including games between Manchester United and Newcastle, and Spurs against Brighton.Thereaposs nothing quite like the atmosphere of watching the game in the pub at Christmas, particularly after being stuck in the house and visiting family for days on end.

And then theyaposve put Wales in with England. Jamie joked that it could be predicting the future with a post-Brexit map of Britain.  Theyaposre saying Wales isnapost a country anymore and weaposve been shoved onto the side of England, he said. Jamie, a Plaid Cymru councillor in Neath, said itaposs not the first time the store had forgot about Wales. He hit out: During the  European football championships, which Wales were in, MS put up posters urging people to support England. Weaposre used to it in Wales now, being subjected to that nonsense.It shouldnapost happen but it does. Marks and Spencer needs to recognise that Wales actually exists as a country. Theyaposve managed to offend absolutely everyone with one go, with this jigsaw. Jamie tweeted the department store in Welsh, asking why his home country had become part of England. Dozens of people backed the councillor and demanded MS remove the insulting puzzle immediately.

Claire Hawley was one of  homeless people who were given a free meal at Wingaposs International Cuisine buffet restaurant on Christmas Eve.She visited the restaurant in Hull with her two daughters Charlotte, seven, and Sophie, five, for a meal after struggling with  Universal Credit and losing £ per month in payments.The Raise the Roof Homeless Project joined forces with the restaurant to hand out food and gt boxes to give back to those who need it. Claie said the meal, along with help from Raise the Roof to pay for presents for her kids, has saved Christmas. Iaposve been losing a lot of money over time and it’s crippled me, she said. The choice this Christmas was either to pay for food and electric or go hungry and coldI was to buy presents. I got what I could for my kids but it really wasnapost much at all after paying the bills. I was contemplating telling kids that Santa couldn’t get to us this year, it was that bad, because I couldnapost get them presents. But then I met up with Carl and everyone has been so kind and generous and people rallied round me and were so nice and got gts for my daughters. It saved Christmas really.

It would be lovely to end  on a high note, but the season of goodwill was over in less time than it takes to polish off a box of Quality Street. It’s depressing to be heading into  where black footballers continue to be racially abused while doing their job and where one of our brightest musical talents is racially abused for suggesting racism still exists in Britain. Last weekend, so-called fans during the match between Tottenham and Cha had to be warned three times to stop the abuse, after the Blue’s Antonio Rudiger was racially targeted. Less than  hours earlier, Stormzy was being trolled for saying that, definitely, %, there is racism in Britain. He didn’t say every person in Britain is racist – he was misquoted as saying that and he rightly used his  to set the record straight. The disheartening thing about these rows time and time again is how quickly people who experience racism are gaslighted by those who have never experienced it. The latter group scream the loudest about how much it doesn’t exist in their opinion and then go on to talk about how tolerant they are. Why should you get a prize for being more willing to put up with people who don’t look like you  Being less racist isn’t enough. Tolerance isn’t enough – we need to accept and embrace our dferences. Football pundit Gary Neville wasn’t afraid to blast the game’s top brass for not doing enough to protect players.  But he’s right when he suggests the behaviour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson – who thinks it’s OK to say Muslim women look like letterboxes and call black people “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles” – coupled with an opposition who failed to tackle anti-Semitism, emboldens racists to spew their bile. This year, on a personal level, was one of the toughest I’ve experienced in a long time. But professionally it was one of the most rewarding. I got to spend most of my time working with incredible people who have achieved so much in their careers and are all at the top of their fields.  They’re quietly changing perceptions of what people think of when they imagine a CEO, a founder of a multi-national company or leading entertainment brand. They all happen to be of African, Caribbean and African ­American heritage.

Smiling Alexander K, who is known as Sasha, has an exceptionally rare medical condition which means he has no eyes. When the boy was six-months-old his plight was publicised, leading to people across the world expressing interest in adopting him. Two months on and just in time for Christmas, adoption officials in Tomsk, Russia announced they had found a warm and loving family for him to join. “Little Sasha was taken into care by a Russian family from a dferent city,” an adoption official spokeswoman told the Siberian Times.“It happened during the last month….We cannot reveal any more details about the family. “We are, of course, very happy for baby Sasha and wishing him and his parents all the best.” Svetlana Syrova, the journalist who first wrote about Sasha, said it was “special Christmas magic” that led to the boy being adopted. In his new le he will have sisters to play with a summer country house to visit. The baby’s young birth mother learned about the rare and dficult disability her unborn child had when she was  weeks pregnant.  She felt that in her circumstances she would not be able to care for him. Sasha suffers from an extreme from of rare SOX anophthalmia syndrome and was born without eyeballs. Only three cases of the condition have been registered. Sasha will never be able to see unless there are massive medical breakthroughs during his letime. In October, when he was put up for adoption, Tomsk doctor Tatiana Rudnikovich said: “Sasha is going through all regular check ups and tests like any other baby of his age.  “He is doing well.” His nurse from the orphanage where he lived in Tomsk went with him to St Petersburg where tiny eye orbs were implanted to ensure that his face does not grow deformed.

Graham Branfield, , claimed £, in Disability Living Allowanceand £, in pension credit over  years. A former neighbour, Helen Gillespie, told Bristol Crown Court he was also a regular dog walker and would shop at Morrisons and carry items without dficulty. Branfield denied fraudulently claiming the payments, but a jury convicted him after deliberating for  minutes on December . Retired shopkeeper Brian Sheehan, who runs Fur and Feathers in Knowle, also gave evidence during the trial. He said Branfield regularly purchased heavy bags of wild bird seed and pigeon corn from him two or three times a week. He said the pensioner would park his car near the premises before carrying kg or kg bags to it without dficulty. Ultimately, Department of Works and Pensionsstaff tailed Branfield as he went on one of his regular shopping runs, and captured evidence on camera. Branfield, who had an interest in feeding wild birds, said he was suffering from a plethora of debilitating ailments for which he was medicated but he was still able to move around in pain. He also admitted to a small amount of catalogue work, for which he said he drove, reports Bristol Live . On December , Judge James Patrick jailed Branfield for two years, to run extra to a four-year term he is serving for breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order. The judge said: This was a simply breath-taking piece of dishonesty. You are an intelligent man and a man with some charm. But you are a manipulative man.  Your application may have been honest from the beginning but you saw it as a blank cheque. You received very large sums of money indeed. The jury heard interviews Branfield gave in early  during an investigation into alleged benefit fraud. He said he had claimed DLA as he was suffering a lot and took pain medication. Branfield said he suffered from a joint and muscle problem, renal problems and incontinence. He said medication gave him the chance to be mobile but he was still in a lot of pain when moving and it had not got any better in the past  years. He said he could not walk even small distances without pain. He added a doctor had advised him Betterware catalogue work and feeding birds were giving him something to live for.

Award-winning Michelin-starred cook Jeff Baker, who has fed the likes of the Queen, previously told us how we were cooking sausages and bacon wrong. And now the Executive Development Chef, who works at  Farmison  Co , has lted the lid on how to rustle up delicious tasting roasties every time. The roast potato is a staple addition to our Christmas dinner and arguably the best part, but they can be one of the most dficult components to perfect. Jeff has more than three decades experience in a professional kitchen, and has worked with some of the best in the business - so he knows his stuff. Here he shares his tips with .... You must buy fresh potatoes It may sound obvious, but having fresh potatoes to make roasties is the first step to perfection. You should never try to use old potatoes when cooking as they could be rotten which is sure to make you very, very ill. When you buy your potatoes, you should inspect them for any signs of mould or damage and then place the perfect potatoes in a cardboard box or paper bag - this ensures the best ventilation. To store, put your potatoes in a cool and dark place that is approximately  to  degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure to check your potatoes whilst they are being stored, as they may become soft and shrivelled and will, therefore, need to be thrown away.. Know your King Edward from your Maris Piper  Yes, there are perfect potatoes for roasting! By choosing the best potato for the job you can ensure that you will get the gorgeous crispy edges and fluffy centres that we all dream of. I would recommend King Edwards or Maris Pipers, which are readily available this time of the year. However, your standard white potatoes will also work, you just may need to give them a good shake in a sieve after par-boiling to fluff them up.. Stay away from soggy roasties  A mistake can be made in trying to crisp up your potatoes by almost drowning them in oil, leaving them burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside. This is why it is important to fluff up your potatoes before roasting by partially boiling or using my preferred method of steaming. You can parboil your spuds for ten minutes in salted water or steam for  minutes . Be sure to allow your potatoes to dry and cool slightly before roasting.  . Feeding the   Your roasties will need some room…  As most of us are cooking for our whole family at Christmas time, we will be making a lot of food and lots of roast potatoes. If you’re making more than usual, several trays are recommended instead of forcing them all on one tray. This is because the potatoes need the space to crisp up in the oil or you run the risk of them becoming soggy as they sit in the oil. So make sure that you grab an extra roasting tray or two so that all your hard work does not go to waste!. Yes, it all comes down to the perfect timing The debate of how long you should cook your spuds is definitely up for contesting around Christmas time.

Some people who purchased festive poultry from Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons had to make last minute changes to their dinner plans when they say they discovered the meat was rotten. Divya Gill bought her turkey on December and came to prep it for the big day on Christmas Eve. When she did she says she discovered it was stinking and out of date. Absolutely appalled at Morrisons to buy a turkey two days ago and to open it to prep today for it to be completely out of date - as in my dog started gagging - when the sell by date is the th, Divya said. Lucky that we opened it today and MS had plenty of not rotten food left. Vicky Broomhead also had issues with the turkey she bought from Morrisons. Have you had a Christmas dinner disaster  Email webnews@mirror She said: I have just come to prep my turkey to go in the oven and it stinks. It has gone off so now thereaposs no turkey for family on Xmas day. Morrisons was not the only supermarket chain to come under fire from disgruntled Christmas dinner enthusiast.  One person even claimed Tesco has aposruined Christmasapos after he shared a snap of his turkey that had a unsettling black tinge. He posted a picture of the bird which had a cm hole in its back surrounded by what appeared to be rotten flesh.James Davies claims he picked up his bird from an Aldi on December  and placed it in the fridge as soon as he got home.  He said: When we came to cook it this afternoon, Christmas Eve, we were concerned by the nasty smell coming from it. Nevertheless, we still cooked it in the oven, but the smell still remained, and clearly the meat was rotten. Our Christmas dinner is completely ruined for tomorrow. We have no replacement. Ricky Yates has similarly been left one turkey short of a full dinner after claiming to discover his Aldi purchase was off.We opened the turkey after all supermarkets were closed, and are now left with trimmings and a cheese board to fill Christmas lunch, he said. According to industry website britishturkey a turkey will smell very gamey, acrid or of ammoniait has gone off. The flesh could also have a greenish tinge and feel quite slimy. If in any doubt - donapost risk it - bin it, advice on its website reads.  The flesh should be in good colour and look moist in appearance with no dry flaky patches.

Jeff Baker, Executive Development Chef at Farmison  Co , has shared withhis  top tips for a stress-free festive feast. The award-winning Michelin-starred cook, who has fed the likes of the Queen, previously told us how we were cooking  sausages , bacon  and roast potatoes wrong.And now he has lted the lid on making the perfect gravy, turkey, cheese board and more. Here Jeff shares his tips and tricks... . Get the drinks in the fridge...now! Amongst the carnage of cooking times and counting plates, we usually forget about the drinks. To avoid any upset once your guests have arrived - pop your fizz, white wine or beer in the fridge as soon as you can. Not your tipple  If you’re partial to a bottle of red, ensure that it’s been opened a few hours before dinner to let it breathe and intensy the flavour. . Pre-feast nibbles to satisfy all the guests Don’t faff around with fancy canapes and waste valuable cooking time! Whipping up super speedy nibbles couldn’t be any easier.  Smoked meats and fish make for a tasty and simple selection whilst you prepare for the main event. Simply serve with sourdough and condiments of your choice. This tip means that you can get back to perfecting your feast without worrying about entertaining your guests. . A scrumptious starter fit for a feast If you are looking to impress with an indulgent intro to your dinner, baked figs with fresh goats curd and truffle honey will go down a treat. Bake the figsin a cool oven at about °c with the truffle honeyuntil tender . Next, mix together with walnut oiland sherry vinegar , toss in with some rocket leaves and distribute the contents into  bowls. Add the figs and curdinto each bowl and scatter over some broken walnuts. . The perfect gravy  Easy peasy  There’s no need to cut corners and reach for the instant gravy this Christmas. After roasting your Christmas bird, simply tip the excess fat from your roasting tray and add stock of your choice . With the stock in the tray, scrape any leftover meat sediment into the stock and boil to reduce the volume. Add herbs of your choice and pass the liquid through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Want a real rich treat  Reduce the gravy to a syrup texture and whisk in a large knob of cold unsalted butter and enjoy! . Roasties from the freezer  I don’t think so…  Arguably the most dficult element of the Christmas spread are the roast potatoes. My top tip is to peel, wash, and steam your potatoes until they are just cooked. This will usually take around  minutes. Once cooked, melt duck fat and toss through the potatoes and season with sea salt. Place on a non-stick tray in a preheated oven set at c, and roast until golden - it’s best to turn them every  mins to ensure this . . How to get the most out of your meat: Turkey  To get the best flavour as well as use up as much of the meat as you can I would suggest to remove the giblets after roasting and keep them for the gravy later. On the day of roasting, sit the turkey in your kitchen and slowly bring it up to room temperature, this ensures an even roast - and don’t forget to weigh your turkey! Soften g of butter with the zest of a lemon, some sea salt, thyme leaves, and a splash of olive oil . Gently lt the skin away from the breast meat, starting at the cavity, and carefully push the softened butter between the skin and flesh. To stuff, cut an onion in two and place it into the cavity with the rindless lemon and a carrot with some fresh sage. Now put the turkey on a wire trivet and place in a preheated oven at °c for  minutes. Then pour ml of water onto the base of the tray and cover the turkey with tin foil. Reduce the heat to °c and roast  minutes per kilo, removing the tin foil for the last  minutes or so to colour the skin. To check the turkey is cooked, pierce the skin between thigh and breast and push the skewer into the flesh, close to the bone. If all has gone to plan, the juices should run clear. Ta da! . Struggle to get the kids to eat vegetables  They’ll ask for seconds with this tip To add extra flavour to carrots, turnips, parsnips and shallots, I simply place them together in a tin foil bag with a sprig of thyme or rosemary, a whole garlic clove, sea salt, and a teaspoon of duck fat. I then bake in the oven for a minimum of  hour until the vegetables are sweet and lightly caramelized. For green vegetables and brassica, I boil them in salted water until just cooked, then I refresh in ice-cold water and drain. To finish, I gently toss in a little butter and cracked pepper, sometimes with toasted almonds, caraway seeds or crispy smoked bacon and a few diced shallots. . An alternative to roast potatoes Yes, there are some people who don’t like the classic roastie. Luckily, parsnip and potato gratin is simple to make and acts as a scrumptious substitute to the royal roast potato. Mix warm equal amounts of whole milk and creamwith a couple of crushed garlic cloves, salt and ground white pepper. Once the mixture is nicely infused, pour it over g of thinly sliced potatoes mixed with g of thinly sliced parsnips. Layer in a gratin dish and bake at °c for  minutes, then continue to lower the heat to °c and cook for a further  minutes until the potatoes are tender. To ensure a cake like texture, press the gratin down now and again. . Mix up your pigs in blankets  Pigs in blankets are a staple at the Christmas table - but there’s no harm in mixing it up a little this year. Try wrapping a pitted prune in some Lancashire pancetta, insert a little sage leaf between the two items, and simply grill. These ‘devils on horseback’ go particularly well with goose and duck as well as all your other roasting birds. . Rich, buttery bread sauce, look no further Take  slices of brioche without crust and turn them into crumbs, then heat ml of whole milk with   diced onion and bouquet garni - then season with salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg. Pour the infused milk onto the breadcrumbs and cook on a gentle heat until slightly thickened. Then whisk in g of cold diced butter and keep at a warm temperature. This recipe can of course be made with simple white breadcrumbs for those guests who prefer a more traditional sauce. . Master your cheese board Serve cheeses made with dferent types of milk- ewe’s, cow’s, goat’s, even buffalo milk, or those made from a blend of milks. Each type of milk has a dferent flavour profile and this will make your selection more ied. Also think about ying textures, smooth, crumbly or sticky, they all make for a great cheese board. I would serve alongside semi dried fruits, some quality butter, and a biscuit or two. If you really want to push the boat out, you could opt for some fruit cheese or truffle honey. Before serving, remove cheeses from their packaging and leave uncovered at room temperature for at least an hour, or even longer. This way, the cheese can breathe and you’ll be able to taste the full spectrum of flavours in each. Be careful not to let the cheese touch each other too much as this can alter the flavour! . Never know what to do with the leftovers  Create another quick and delicious Boxing Day meal as a way to use up any leftover turkey! Dice  onions and soften with a crushed clove of garlic, then add a glass of dry white wine and boil into a syrup. Move on to add ml of poultry stock and ml of cream, bring to the boil and season with salt and pepper. Roughly slice a selection of mixed mushroomsand add to the sauce, then add your shredded turkey and a dozen or so chestnuts, walnuts or almonds to the mix. Simmer for  minutes on a low heat.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Queen has spoken of a testing year in her annual Christmas Day speech as well as discussing the sense of purpose younger generations have shown in tackling issues like climate change. Her comments follow a year which has seen young people inspired to become environmental campaigners by the example of schoolgirl activist Greta Thunberg. During her annual address the Queen acknowledged the bumpy path her family and the country has faced during the past  months, but mentioned some of the positives like the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs first child. She highlighted how often small steps, not the giant leaps bring about lasting change in the world - the theme of her Christmas Day broadcast. The Queen said the Christmas message of peace and goodwill still has relevance today - a comment which follows a year of bitter debates in Parliament and the country over Brexit . She said the message was a reminder of what can be achieved when people abandon their dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. Her words are likely to be interpreted as an appeal for the healing of isions in the country as Britain leaves the EU. The Queen said in her message: The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate. Swedish teenager Gretaaposs activism has sparked a global climate strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters across the world protest by refusing to go to classes. She addressed a UN summit on the issue in September, telling world leaders they had failed to act. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, she said. Her efforts were acknowledged by the Duke of Cambridge who said climate activists were ringing the planetary alarm bell louder. The Queen also spoke about personal joy, describing how she and the Duke of Edinburgh were delighted to welcome an eighth great-grandchild to their family - Harry and Meghanaposs son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - born  years after Queen Victoria. As the Queen spoke viewers saw a photograph, released a few days after Archieaposs birth on May , which captured the moment she and the Duke of Edinburgh saw Archie for the first time as his proud parents and grandmother Doria Ragland looked on.  The Christmas message, produced by the BBC, was recorded in Windsor Castleaposs green drawing room after the General Election but before Philip was admitted to a private London hospital for treatment for a pre-existing but undisclosed condition. The duke spent four nights being treated before he was discharged on Christmas Eve morning, in time to join the royal family celebrations at Sandringham. In her message to the country and Commonwealth the Queen mentioned the carol It Came Upon The Midnight Clear - performed at the end of the broadcast. She added: Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angelsapos message of peace and goodwill. Itaposs a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, itaposs worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. A string of milestones marked during  were mentioned by the Queen, from the th anniversary of the D-Day landings to the th anniversary of the first moon landing. She began her address by highlighting its theme of small steps as she spoke about the Apollo  mission.  As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind, said the Queen. She added: Itaposs a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps. Nearby was a picture of the Queen meeting Armstrong and his Apollo  crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Speaking about D-Day, the Queen mentioned the look of concern on my fatheraposs face as King George VI knew about the secret plans but could not share that burden. Seventy-five years on from the historic landings, she said former enemies had met in friendship at commemorations marking the anniversary in Britain and on the continent. The Queen added: Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps. Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides. By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost. During the broadcast footage was shown of Americaaposs moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the allianceaposs th anniversary. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patrickaposs Day with the Irish Guards. Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences, the Queen added: Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference. The Queenaposs comment about experiencing a bumpy year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past  months. During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender. The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation safe and secure. At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legionaposs Together at Christmas initiative.

The Queen and her relatives come together to celebrate the festivities at their Norfolk estate Sandingham, enjoying three days of family fun. And while their celebrations are obviously slightly fancier than the rest of us, lots of the traditions are surprisingly similar to ours. They open presents, sit down for a huge turkey dinner, have catch-ups and even watch the Queenaposs Speech. Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, George, Charlotte, Louis and other senior members of the family will all be there - but Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Archie are missing the celebrations this year. Weaposve had a look at what the Royals will be getting up to this Christmas. Christmas Eve Afternoon tea Members of the Royal Family arrive at Sandringham at dferent times, but once theyaposre all there and unpacked they gather for afternoon tea. Itaposs believed to be a formal occasion, with the men in black tie and the women wearing gowns and jewels. Opening presents To incorporate their German heritage into the festivities, the family used to open their presents on Christmas Eve as is traditional in the country. Shortly after they arrive they all lay their gts out on dferent tables, so each guest has their own little pile. Prince Philip oversees organising the gts and tells everyone when they can open them. However during a chat with Mary Berry Kate said that they now just open one present on Christmas Eve, and save the rest for the next day. The family exchange cheap joke presents, and in the past Kate bought Harry a aposGrow your Own Girlfriendapos Kit and the Prince got his granny a Leaposs a B****apos shower cap.  Christmas Day Breakfast The royals kick off the big day with breakfast, but many of the couples split up for the first festive meal. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady the women tend to eat in their rooms while the men sit together downstairs. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: On Christmas Day, the ladies generally opt for a light breakfast of sliced fruit, half a grapefruit, toast and coffee delivered to their rooms. The men on the other hand have a much heartier breakfast, usually including eggs, bacon, mushrooms, kippers and grilled kidneys. Church The public get to see the Royals when they head out to a traditional Christmas Day church service at St Mary Magdalene. Hundreds of well-wishers usually gather to see them as they walk into the building, and they often stop to have a chat on the way out. Trips to Church is the only time the Queen carries cash, and she normally pops either a fiver or a tenner in the collection pot - but it could be more at Christmas. Sources have said thereaposs a chance we might see George and Charlotte attending their first royal Christmas church service this year.  Christmas lunch The festive feast is the main event in most homes on Christmas Day, and itaposs no dferent for the Royals who site down to eat at pm. Former royal chef Darren McGrady revealed exactly what the Queen eats during an interview with Good Housekeeping . He said: After church, thataposs when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Sounds delicious!  The Queenaposs Speech Yep, thataposs right - just like the rest of us the Royal Family sit down and watch grannyaposs speech on the BBC at pm. Itaposs prerecorded which means the Queen can watch it back surrounded by her loved ones. Afternoon tea After the speech they all go off for a bit of free time, before gathering again for afternoon tea and a slice of Christmas fruit cake. Chats with the Queen According to former royal butler Paul Burrell, all the royals like to have a one-to-one chat with the Queen during the day, but thereaposs one popular time to do it. Before Princess Dianaaposs first royal Christmas, he advised her to try and get some quality time with the monarch when she was sitting at her card table.  Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than le, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and theyaposre bouncing off the walls after four days. Itaposs like a pinball machine. They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, itaposs the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression. Itaposs what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. The best time to do it is when sheaposs seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and sheaposll always ask people to join her, thataposs your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what youaposre thinking and feeling. Dinner Before long itaposs time for ANOTHER meal, and the royal chefs put on an evening buffet for dinner. Former chef Darren McGrady said thereaposs a buffet dinner with - dferent items. Itaposs always a buffet with the chefs at the table carving.  Before they all tuck in the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the meat. Once heaposs done, the Queen gives him a glass of whiskey and they toast. Itaposs the only time the chef is invited into the dining room. He also revealed that the Queen has a real penchant for chocolate, particularly the dark and minty iety. Apparently she always has a chocolate treat on Christmas. Boxing Day The next day the family will head on on their annual Boxing Day pheasant hunt. Some of the family leave the estate to visit other relatives on Boxing Day. The Cambridges, for example, will head off to celebrate with Kateaposs family, where they enjoy another busy day of festive fun.

Pip told staff she had always wanted to be in the Beaver Scouts – normally for six to eight-year-olds – but feared she was too old. After she hung her hope on the centre’s wishing tree, staff at St Paul’s Care Centre, in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, got in touch with the local Scouts group. The Beavers soon turned up at Pip’s bedside and welcomed her as an honorary member of their Colony.

As this ,-building, kg sweet biscuit creation is so large it even features the town’s local football stadium. Constructed in the Norwegian town of Bergen, this mouth-watering biscuit mountain is built by kindergarteners, schoolchildren, local businesses, and volunteers alike. Named Pepperkakebyen - meaning gingerbread city  - this tradition has been running since  and the founder states they are the original claimants for the world’s largest gingerbread city. Creator Steinar Kristoffersen said: “It is the biggest gingerbread city from year one. It’s nicely decorated, it’s big and a great adventure for everyone before Christmas.”  As well as the gingerbread base, constructions are decorated with ornate icing and sweet candies. In fact, so much detail goes into Pepperkakebyen, you’ll find everything from tiny homes, trains, cars, boats to international signature buildings. Even SK Brann football stadium makes an appearance. Steinar said: “The most ambitious building we’ve had is maybe the Efel tower or Big Ben.” And what happens to this succulent city once it has been admired  Every year the houses are auctioned off in a newspaper advert, anyone can buy a house, with the money going to childrenaposs charities. Steinear said: “The reaction is very positive, there’s a lot of companies and private people who make bids for the houses. Through the years the gingerbread city has contributed nearly  million Norwegian Kroneto charities for children”  Gingerbread houses are thought to have been made popular after the publication of Hansel and Gretel in Germany in the early s. Within the tale, the curious children abandoned in the forest stumbled upon an edible house of bread and sugar. In response to the popularity of the story German bakers started baking similar creations as a means of increasing sales.  For Bergen, the event not only raises money for charity but also attracts tourists to the city. On the back of Bergen’s success more gingerbread ‘worlds’ have cropped up throughout the country. You’ll find them in cities like Stavanger, Hammerfest, Haugesund, Fredrikstad, and Bodø - but this hasn’t has an affect on Bergenaposs Pepperkakebyen. Steinar said: “Every year more and more tourist are coming to Bergen and the gingerbread city, so it’s having a positive effect on tourism.” In  , the future of Pepperkakebyen was thrown into a doubt when much of the exhibition was destroyed shortly after its opening when a ‘drunk’ vandal smashed the creation, spraying it with a fire extinguisher and paint.Steinar said: “I felt very bad on behalf of all the kids.” A -year-old man was arrested after the police receive a tip from his friends. Amazingly Pepperkakebyen was open one week later after the incident. The organisers of Stavanger’s gingerbread city have declared in a recent edition of Stavanger Aftenbladet their ambition to become Norway’s biggest.They currently receive about  buildings compared to Bergen’s , but are encouraging the community to come together and create a much bigger attraction in the future.

at Tannadice and then a poor - defeat on home turf the last time they met.And the former Hearts and Falkirk man is keen to put that right on Friday night as the two go head to head once more at the home of league leaders United.McGhee told the Tele: “We want to do ourselves justice this time.“We have to lay a glove on United – the last two times we didn’t.“In derbies you have to earn the right to play first of all and we’ve fallen short.“We need to put our own stamp on the game and then relax and play our normal game.“Derbies are always dferent.“It doesn’t matter how well you are playing or how well the opposition are playing, it’s just about who wants it most on the day.“Whoever executes the gameplan best and keeps the head normally wins the game.“Regardless of how many they’ve won in a row, it would be nice to win a derby, not only for ourselves as players, but also for the fans and the club. vw, px\"  “Eventhey had lost their last nine games, there would be massive pressure on us to win anyway.”McGhee admits that pressure has been on all season at Dens Park during some dficult spells.However, he expected nothing  after signing for the club in the summer.The -year-old is the club’s only ever-present in the league this season and is keen to maintain his consistent start to le at Dens Park.He added: “I’ve played every game which I’m quite proud of coming into a new club.“I’m delighted the gaffer has shown the faith in me to do that and I can’t thank him or the club enough for giving me the chance.“I knew coming to Dundee I had to up my game with the size of the club and the players I would be playing with.“I am used to that after playing at Hearts with the pressure there is at a club like that.“My aim was to take myself back to that level and I feel I’ve done that this season.“I need to keep moving forward, work hard and see where it takes us.”Dundee head into Friday night with two welcome wins at their backs and McGhee was delighted to notch a clean sheet in a - win at Partick over the weekend.“It was a good win down at Partick,” he said.“I think we could have scored more goals but we did play really well.“We created chances and I can’t really remember them having many, apart from when Kenny Miller hit the bar on the break.“It was a good performance and set us up to look forward to Friday night’s game.“It was a comfortable end to the game for us.“The boys worked their socks off which makes things easier for us defenders.“I didn’t feel threatened at all during the entire game which is pleasing – that’s not happened every week this season for us.“To get a clean sheet, too, is great for the confidence at the back to take into Friday night.“I think the last two games were among our best ones of the season, apart from the last half-hour against Dunfermline obviously.“It feels like we are starting to click and can try to get some consistency going, get points on the board, keep churning away and see where it takes us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

the hope that families and iniduals alike will be able to enjoy it in the warmer months.There are big plans in place for the wooded site, which runs between Danestone and Grandholm, which has been split into three dferent phases.The first involves the clearing of some of the more overgrown parts of the country park.Aberdeen City Council workers helped out to tidy up the area, to assist the volunteers in getting it ready for the future, with proposals including installing benches and fairy doors.Chairman of the Danestone Community Council Derek Davidson said: “We were very lucky, the council cleared the outside for us, which we asked them to do a few months ago.“It helps us to be able to put in the bits and pieces that we want to, such as fairy doors.“We also want to put in benches and do more on a long-term basis.“I’ve requested two, but we might get four, benches from Union Terrace gardens to go in.“There’ll be new ones going into the park and they don’t need the old ones any more, so we’ve secured a few of those.“We’ll definitely be getting two, but hopefully we can get four.“We’re also looking at getting some orchard trees in as well.”It’s hoped that by opening up the park, it will encourage more people to use the shops and facilities at Grandholm, which are all locally owned, as well as generally inviting people into the area again.It’s proposed that the fairy doors might go up in the wooded area as soon as spring or summer next year.Derek added: “We want to see people starting to use the area again.“There’s a few shops in Grandholm andwe could get the park up and running it might encourage more people into the area and help local businesses.”As well as creating a welcoming area, the community council has larger plans afoot, which it is currently working on drumming support up for.It is also at the stage that it is looking for funding for the initiative.Anyone interested in volunteering to support the initiative is asked to contact

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10643313.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes. It will take more than a landslide defeat to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"rail-renationalisation-end-vote-loser","story":"Long-suffering commuters have waited forever for these improvements, of course. And since I donrsquot have to make the journey every day, I donrsquot have insight into whether my journey was representative . But credit where itrsquos due.There was a sense of irony, then, when later that same day Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced he will end ScotRail operator Abelliorsquos contract three years early, in . The Dutch operator, which took over the ScotRail franchise in , made big promises about train and service improvements up and down the network, from the West Highlands to the Borders. But its performance record has been woeful, with staffing issues in particular seemingly crippling the network, leading to delays, cancellations and overcrowding.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractNot all of these things were Abelliorsquos fault, however. The fragmented nature of the network since privatisation in , which sees the tracks owned by one company, the trains by another, leased to a third to operate, means ScotRail takes the blame for problems ndash signalling, bad weather, leaves on the line etc ndash it has no control over. But thatrsquos the way it goes. Understandably. frustrated passengers hit out at whoever is closest to hand, and that tends to be ScotRail and its staff.The blame game is an increasingly important part of running or overseeing a railway network, especially when passengers can take to social media social and complain in real time. So, although Abellio clearly failed to meet many of its targets, I donrsquot doubt that public pressure also played a part in the decision to end the contract early.And thatrsquos why Irsquom surprised Mr Matheson seems so keen on bringing ScotRail back into public hands, having already mooted setting up a public operator to bid against private sector rivals for the ScotRail contract. What makes him think the public sector will automatically do a better job than the likes of Abellio, which is itself owned by the Dutch state  Especially when itrsquos clear having control of the franchise is only part of the equation. Without control over the tracks , and the sort of eye-watering multi-billion pound investment that would probably require tax increases, European-style railways are a pipe dream.And at least under the current system the Scottish Government has a private sector enemy to blame and sack when things go wrong. Does the SNP really want to deal with the potential fallout at the ballot box when angry commuters turn their ire on ministers rather than Abellio or whichever private firm comes next  Mr Matheson should be careful what he wishes for. With building support independence the main partyrsquos main priority, taking over a potentially vote-losing train franchise is surely an unnecessary risk that could lead to dire consequences.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractHe is not alone in being tempted up the nationalisation track, of course. The re-nationalisation of the UKrsquos railways was one of the few policies in the recent Labour manesto that seemed to be popular on the doorstep. And taking into consideration recent events in Englandand Scotland, one can understand the demands for change.But we hark back to the old days of British Rail with rose-tinted nostalgia when even a cursory glance at some of the realities tells you this is largely misplaced. We appear to have conveniently forgotten cold, dirty old rolling stock in thes taking us on deadly slow journeys. Passenger numbers speak for themselves, having more than doubled in the  years since privatisation. Lest we forget, too, it was a drastic programme of line closures in the sthat led to many communities in Scotland ndash including the entire Borders region ndash having their railway lines closed, with terrible economic and social consequences.Put simply, what matters to passengers is having modern trains with good facilities that arenrsquot too expensive and run on time. Who owns and operates the lines and trains is of secondary importance.

But referendums arenrsquot won on seats won, they are won on the number of votes won across the country.Pro-independence votes seem to struggle to get beyond  per cent. Even with a record turnout in , the number was five per cent short.To me this is the SNPrsquos biggest stumbling block.Willie Towers, Alford.IN an otherwise excellent article Alison Rowatappears to accept at face value the assertion that Tony Blair is accurate in his analysis of why Labour lost the  General Election. In fact Labour gained signicantly more votes in  than it did in  , , and . In  Jeremy Corbyn managed to attract ,, votes whereas in  Mr Blair got ,, votes.The problem for the Labour Party and indeed all of the opposition parties is that under the first past the post electoral system the Tories managed to hold on to their share of the vote from  and slightly increase this by entering into an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. The Brexit Party stood down all of their candidates in Tory-held seats which ensured that they held on to these despite a four per cent increase in vote share by the LibDems.The fact is that had Labour, the LibDems, and SNP agreed a similar electoral pact with each other by standing down candidates in their respective target seats they would undoubtedly have reversed the result of this election. In this scenario the Tories would have lost  seats to the combined opposition resulting in another hung parliament. In Scotland such an electoral pact would probably have resulted in the SNP taking three further seats from the Tories, including the seats of Alister Jack and David Mundell. Instead of ruminating over the consequences of a Tory-hard Brexit we would now be discussing how the coalition Labour LibDem SNP government was about to bring forward plans to hold a second EU referendum.All of the opposition partiesneed to learn from this defeat that in politics as in le cooperation against a common enemy is essentialvictory is to be achieved.John Smith, Dunblane.FOR some Christians the Christmas story is a myth, what matters being not that it is a factual account of historical events, but that it is a telling of the truths of the human condition. We believe it to be the very human story of a child born into the squalid conditions of poverty and homelessness, into a family of migrants. There are seemingly deliberate reminders of those at the margins of society with the presence of the shepherds, impoverished outcasts of their day.Our st century story is one of increasing homelessness, of more children growing up in poverty, of migrants made to feel unwelcome in spite of their contribution to our society and refugees fleeing hunger, destruction and persecution being shown insufficient compassion.

But do they really mean it First, we can all see the polls. Support for independence hasnrsquot changed much, but neither has support for remaining in the UK and that means therersquos a good risk of Yes losing in . In private, many senior figures in the Scottish Government accept the only comfortable referendum will be when the polls are showing around % for Yes for at least a year. And many unionists would agree with that: % would be a ldquosettled will ndash   is not.:Letters: The SNP surely cannot be so lucky next timeThere are other reasons to doubt the SNPrsquos insistence on .

We also know the FM is asking for a  referendumin the knowledge a Tory No will be sent up from London, England, and in the hope the Tory No will build resentment in time for a referendum she has a better chance of winning.Question two: Do you honestly think the election result is a mandate for the referendum Here is what ldquoScotlandrsquos Right to Choose says about the SNPrsquos mandate: ldquothe people of Scotland have voted on manestos containing pledges on an independence referendum, and have elected a Scottish Parliament where a majority of the MSPs support such a referendum. It also says the current mandate was reinforced by the recent General Election.But is anyone buying that, particularly from a party that has always objected to the flaws in the UKrsquos electoral system  The Scottish Government says that ldquofor  of the  years since  hellip Scotland has been ruled by governments elected by fewer than half of Scottish constituencies. True. But you could just as easily say Scotland is ruled by an SNP government thatrsquos supported by less than half the Scottish electorate. You could also say the SNP won % of the Scottish constituencies at the general election even though they attracted only % of the vote.The point is that our flawed system is usually an inaccurate reflection of opinion, and yet the Scottish Government is behaving asitrsquos Gospel. As I said last week, thousands of unionist Scots voted SNP at the general election because they wanted Brexit stopped and their votes do not count as support for a second referendum .:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodThe bottom line  I think most Scots would accept a referendumthere was evidence of a settled will, as there was in the s for devolution. But the number of constituencies a party has in a flawed system is not a good or definitive measure of public opinion, especially on something as important as the constitution. A flawed system produces a flawed mandate.Question three: Do you accept that Scotland leaving the UK could be harder than the UK leaving the EU The Scottish Governmentrsquos document says a vote for independence in  would allow the smoothest transition to an independent Scotland taking its place as a member of the EU. Ah yes. Smooth transitions. Open borders. The easiest trade deal in human history. See how easily the slogans of Brexiters become the slogans of Scottish nationalists.The reality is that Scexit looks way trickier than Brexit. The UK is a sovereign state which means it can leave the EU without having to decide its currency it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies.The same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make many choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit ndash on shared assets and debts for instance. All of this means Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the European Union.And thatrsquos before we talk about the border. The UK is going to be out of the single market and may restrict EU immigration. An independent Scotland, on the other hand, would be in the EU and would follow the four freedoms, including freedom of movement. Therefore, there would have to be checks at the Scottish border and no amount of Brexit-style reassurance from the Scottish Government is going to change that.And finally: do you believe a close result in a second independence referendum would be accepted as legitimate in Scotland A little bit more from Scotlandrsquos Right to Choose: ldquoWe are committed to an agreed, legal process hellip which will be accepted as legitimate in Scotland, the UK as a whole, and by the international community.Fair enough. Whatrsquos more, the First Minister seems to have demonstrated her commitment to an agreed, legal process by ruling out wheezes like an indicative referendum.However, the important phrase here is ldquoaccepted as legitimate. Brexit has taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin ndash ision, bitterness, chaos, anger, and the losers push for another vote ndash and thatrsquos surely what would happen after a Scottish referendum next year, especially with the polls as they are. The result would be close. It would be contested and resisted and fought over.And answer me this, First Minister.

The people have protested, we marched and then we rallied. We have made our position clear the Government needs to act for the future of humanity.Many politicians praised the young protestors, describing them as ldquoinspirational and their actions saw the Scottish Government pledge to do more to tackle the crisis.In April, Nicola Sturgeon declared a ldquoclimate emergency in her speech to the SNP party conference and pledged that Scotland would ldquolive up to our responsibility to tackle it.The following month, the SNP abolished its plans to cut air departure tax from Scottish Airports as it was ldquono longer compatible with its climate targets, while a Bill to introduce a ldquonet-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions by  -

That was updated by Boris Johnson in , when he declared as part of his speech for the annual Margaret Thatcher Lecture that inequality is essential to fostering the ldquospirit of envy which like greed, he argued, was a ldquovaluable spur to economic activity.The ldquogreed is good dogma has its roots in the Chicago School of Economics. Led by Milton Friedman, and known as the Chicago Boys, they set about defining what makes a thriving economy. Low regulation, privatisation and the rolling back of the public sphere. Crucially, this would be an global project to be implemented by the International Monetary Fund, among others.This brand of rampant capitalism,which has come to be known as neoliberalism, was exported with profound and long-lasting consequences, and often through the use of force, and anti-democratic coercion.For Friedman and his ideological acolytes who became hegemonic in the s and s, greed was in reality the organising principle of the corporation, the executive, the shareholder and indeed all iniduals. In this way the sole purpose ndash the only task ndash of a corporate executive was to enrich their shareholders.In a wide-ranging critique of Friedman and the political representatives of the Chicago Boys who triumphed in the s and set the economic consensus for the ensuing decades ndash Thatcher and Reagan ndash Nobel Prize-winning economist Dr Joseph Stiglitz argues that this approach has been socially and economically disastrous.For Stiglitz, who disagreed but never the less respected Friedman, the approach led to intolerablelevels of inequality. Such inequality is now seen as a threat to social peace, and the basis of political instability domestically and across the world, as well as a grave social ill by many defenders of capitalism as a whole, including Stiglitz.ldquoPaying attention to everyone s self-interest ndash in other words to the common welfare ndash is in fact a precondition for ones own ultimate wellbeinghellip it isnt just good for the soul its good for business, he argues.But such is the short-term nature of profit making ndash that planning investment, shoring up environmental protections and prioritising the needs of the many, not the few ndash to coin a phrase ndash is countervailing to the logic of the system. So the logic needs to be accompanied by something a little more doctrinaire.After all, when CEOs earn  times as much as their employees, a great deal of ideological pressure is needed to make this reality as sustainable one.That the Amazon is being cut down, or that Amazon workers earn pennies in comparison to its anti-union CEO: these can simply be rationalised as moral economic incentives that deliver for shareholders andfor society as a whole as wealth ldquotrickles down.Perhaps consumer capitalism is what people really want and that is really what defines us as human beingsndash like it or not. Or so the argument goes.Wersquove all seen the images of Black Friday ndash where people push each other to the ground in the rush for cheap consumer goods. Wersquove all ndash apparently ndash accepted our entry into a competition for the latest gadgets, cars or clothes. Especially at Christmas time.Little wonder then, that a recent YouGov poll showed that over a third of people were planning on taking out lines of credit to cover festive shopping. It is a quite dizzying cycle. One day the adverts are for the latest must-have products. The next about how much lower in price those products are in the New Year sales. And then, finally, we get the ads for debt helplines.And do we even want le to be commodied in this way  Last year a survey found that in the UK there were around  million unwanted gts. Perhaps thatrsquos this biggest trick of all. All of these products we are told we need, all of the ldquogreed is good dogma, and all of the short-term accumulation of profit doesnrsquot make us happy. In reality it does the opposite.It makes us anxious, adds to our economic stress, and damages our mental health. The never ending slew of useless consumer goods produces fantastic wealth, which is then systematically held back from society at large, often funnelled into off-shore accounts.In the US ndash international headquarters of the Chicago Boys ndash the greed-is-good logic is alive and well. What do General Motors, Netflix, Starbucks and Chevron all have in common  None of them paid a dollar in federal income tax last year. While millions will be worrying about the impossibility of affording health insurance this festive season.Such a social and economic system breeds a culture of inidualism, where the end of society, unless there is a photo-opportunity at a food bank, is finally realised. Fear and ision comes to trump solidarity and hope.But maybe that is just what we are meant to believe. Irsquove never bought into such a pessimistic view of humanity. Indeed ndash despite political events ndash Irsquom sure that the longing for sharing, looking after one an other, and community will overcome the ravages of late capitalism.This year, Glaswegians donated pound, worth of gts for over , children living at the sharp end of austerity and poverty. Foodbank drives are inundated, and the Clutha is opening its doors on Christmas Day for those who are without company, or homes. Thousands of acts of solidarity will take place this Christmas, none of them with monetary reward.Our society and our humanity is worth much more than that. So as this year comes to a close, and we look ahead to dficult times to come ndash for people and for the planet ndash never give up hope in our capacity for compassion. Nor, in the eventual victory of solidarity over greed. The coming years will need acts of kindness, support and yes ndash joy ndash as well as a clear sighted challenge to the economic doctrines that have passed their sell-by date."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-return-little-women","story":"Whorsquos in the new movie Meryl Streep and Laura Dern head-up the latest movie version of the classic American novel, that also features Emma Watson and Saoirse Ronan.Itrsquos not the first time itrsquos been on the big screen This is in fact the eighth film adaptation, with previous reworkings including a TV mini-series in  starring Maya Hawke that aired on BBC One, a  movie, starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale, and a  film featuring Katharine Hepburn.The new moviersquos already a hit It has been critically acclaimed in the United States, with the American Film Institute declaring it one of the top  films of  and the Hollywood Foreign Press granting it two nominations for the upcoming Golden Globes, including Best Actress in a Motion Picture for Miss Ronan, who plays the main character, Jo March.Its a true story Author Louisa May Alcott was inspired by her own childhood, as the semi-autobiographical Little Women tells the tale of the impoverished March sisters, Meg, Beth, Amy and Jo who live with their mother in New England while their father is working as a pastor in the American Civil War.

Whatrsquos sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and a simple majority should be allowed to win the next independence referendum using the same rules as those employed by the UK Government to drag Scotland out of the EU against its collective will.Dennis White, Lanark.YOU publish a letter from Stefan Slater in which he puts forward a view thatthere is ever to be another referendum on Scottish independence then the threshold for leaving the UK should be set at a two-thirds majority.I take the view that referendums have no place in our democracy as they are a blunt instrument and a cop-out for those iniduals we elect and remunerate handsomely to make decisions on a plethora of issues andwe disagree with their judgments we can show our displeasure at the ballot box.However, being realistic it seems we are on a path whereby the referendum will come into play more and more, so the suggestion by Mr Slater seems reasonable with an important caveat.Voting must be legislated to be compulsory and no longer should it be acceptable for circa  to  per cent of the electorate to abrogate their civic duty. As is the case for example in Australia, the electorate must either cast a postal ballot or attend a polling station or face a financial penalty ... spoiling your paper is quite acceptable but apathy is not.If implemented them any result achieved could truly be claimed to be the democratic will of the people.James Martin, Bearsden.IAN W Thomsonflags up some negative headlines for the SNP in The Herald over recent weeks and suggests that come the next Holyrood elections the SNP wont be \"so lucky\" and will be hoping for \"some kind of amnesia\" to afflict the electorate. However, as the SNP won  per cent of the seats at this months General Election, and as Nicola Sturgeon won  per cent of the vote in The Heralds own poll which which leader won the Scottish Leaders Debate, I think it highly unlikely that the Scottish voting public will be displaying any signs of amnesia next time they visit the polling stations and I doubtthey will forget that among many other achievements it is the SNP government which has delivered baby boxes, extra free childcare, free university tuition, free prescriptions, free personal care for those in need, regardless of age.The electorate know that the SNP is committed to putting Scotlands future in Scotlands hands, unlike the Tories who disdainfully ignore Scotlands clear vote to remain within the European Union, unlike Labours muddled policy on the EU which saw its votes melt in the sun, and unlike the LibDems and their two-faced position of being in favour of a second referendum on Europe, but denying a second vote on Scottish Independence. The SNPs success in winning this General Election in Scotland, as well as the two previous General Elections, the European elections last May, and the last three Scottish Parliament elections is nothing to do with luck, and everything to do with delivering for Scotland and honouring the wishes of Scotlands voters.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon insists her call for the right to hold a second independence referendum is now ldquounarguable. Yet when the  Scottish independence referendum was agreed it had the benefit of cross-party support, wide backing amongst the public wherever they actually stood on the issue of independence, and of course UK Government approval through the Edinburgh Agreement. The current strident demand for a rerun of the referendum has none of those benefits, and no prospect of that changing anytime soon.The calls for indyref come solely from the independence movement, and primarily from an SNP leadership desperate to maintain the momentum of its grievance driven agenda.Keith Howell, West Linton.NICOLA Sturgeonrsquos latest beef is that she has a mandate for a new referendum whereas Boris Johnson does not have a mandate for Brexit. She should consider the facts before whingeing about this: Mr Johnson is acting on the basis of a referendum result in which he was on the winning side Ms Sturgeonrsquos party demanded a referendum and lost it. It is clear which of them has a mandate, and it is not Ms Sturgeon. I write as a Remainer .Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD respectfully remind Brian McMillanthat, while Brexiters of all shades are constantly ramming down our throats that the UK voted to leave the EU, almost every second voter entering the polling station in June  voted to Remain. In the  independence referendum, a sizeable minorityvoted Yes but this doesnt stop No supporters from continually telling us the Scotland voted to remain in the UK. Im afraid that Mr McMillan is going to have to accept that these isions are real and here and unlikely to go away in the foreseeable future, despite Boris Johnsons view that we should all now move on and live in harmony.Jim Leslie, East Kilbride.ITS only a matter of weeks ago that Prime Minister Johnson was suffering among the biggest Commons defeats ever recorded: now he has a substantial majority, a weak and ideological split official opposition party, and he is crowing loudly on his dung heap. This is all on the back of the small margin of an increase in the Tory vote of . per cent, hardly a huge public endorsement of his policies. While we must wait a while to see how Mr Johnsonrsquos ldquopromises play out, I suspect another one per centwill be cheering loudest, and the new Tory ldquoBlue Wall in the north of England may find they have bought the proverbial ldquopig in a poke.But he is pressuring Channel  and the BBC, threatening to interfere in the judicial system, making voting more dficult and misrepresenting England as the UK. That small margin of one per cent is allowing him to dig in for the long run, and as we see with Donald Trump, may be dficult to dislodge.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon is on record as saying the time for another referendum would be when the polls showed  per cent in favour over a sustained period. This is because she knows thatshe loses again that it is game over for decades. The reality is she doesnrsquot want another referendum soon as the polls consistently hover around  per cent. All her strident demands are being made for two reasons. The first is to keep her supporters buoyed up and the second is that she will be able to use the inevitable refusal to hold a referendum from Boris Johnson as an excuse to scream and shout about the poor downtrodden Scots, hoping to stir up anti Westminster feelings in Scotland.She constantly refers to the people of Scotland being dragged out of the EU against their will. Twenty-eight out of  Scottish council areas voted No to independence in  with my own area, East Lothian, voting  per cent No. Are we all to be dragged out of the UK against our will Donald Lewis, Gford.AS a director of a not-for-profit community sports club I am required to be a part of an interview  to select employees.

If we were foolish or incompetent enough to appoint such a person we would be hauled over the coals by stakeholders and rightly so.However when we translate the scenario to a national level this is exactly what the voters of England have done. I have heard the excuse \"But I like Boris\" and that is fine. Most of us know a lovable rogue but we would never consider putting them in charge of our finances.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I#ll be doing both on a km running track.#She added: #My attempt will see me loop a running track  times a day, every day for  days. The current official Guinness World ultra-marathon record is  days whilst the current record of  marathons on  consecutive days for the standard distance track marathons is held by Kayln Jolivette from Ohio.#My attempt is in aid of Wellbeing of Women # a brilliant charity working super hard to transform the lives of women and their families through much needed research and training.#My aim is to raise as much money as possible, so that together we can fund research into the menopause. My hope is that my attempt will raise awareness of the menopause, the symptoms many women experience and to encourage others to think about how they can create healthy lestyles to help them through this period of their lives # and beyond.#She went on to say: #I#ve been training really hard to make sure that I succeed in my attempt, and I will be pushing my body to the limit # all for this amazing cause. I ask you to give generously because every single woman in all of our lives will, at some point and on some level, experience the menopause. It#s a given.

Instead the overcast sky and sodden turf served to make her pensive mood more sullen. Then it happened. The moment that changed her Christmas beyond all her most fevered wishes…“First Minister, there’s a call for you,” said her Deputy Permanent Secretary, “it’s the Prime minister, he wishes to speak to you with some urgency.” “Really  Whatever for  He’s already made his sham post-election courtesy call. Unless he’s offering me an independence referendum I’d rather be at the dentists or in AE than speak to him again.” The First Minister’s contempt for Boris Johnson was biting.The DPS did not relent, however. “His Permanent Secretary was most insistent and said he would put the Prime Minister through immediately, he’s holding on the line now”.“Oh, all right then, I’ll take it in the drawing room, but make sure it’s recorded, I’m not having him saying one thing to me and leaking a dferent story to the English media.”She strode off to her favourite antique sofa, sat down and picked up the receiver, “First Minister here”, she said in an intentionally clipped tone asshe had been rudely disturbed.“Good morning First Minister, I am so glad we can speak, I have some serious news I must impart to you before anyone other. I do so hope it will make your Christmas brighter and bring great jollity at this joyous time of year,” said Prime Minister Johnson.Indferent already, the First Minister decided to be curt in reply, “I don’t have a great deal of time, I was just going to do some last minute Christmas shopping…”But before she could say anymore the Prime Minster spoke over her, “I’ve decided to be your personal Father Christmas. I received your letter to Santa, that formal request for a Section  Order, and after some more thought, I’ve discussed it with my Cabinet and it is agreed. You can have your Christmas wish, you can have the referendum. The procedures are already in hand and I shall be announcing it to the country immediately after this call.”Sturgeon was for once, momentarily lost for words. The pause was interrupted only by Boris Johnson saying, “First Minister, are you still there, did you hear me, I am agreeing to your request for a referendum.”Full of mixed emotions ranging from bewilderment to anger, and worry to puzzlement, Sturgeon gathered herself. There must be more to this she mused only last Friday Johnson had called and ruled out any referendum, so why the change of heart, was there a concealed plan  There’s always a concealed plan, she thought, for she always concealed her own intentions behind a wall of spin and knew Johnson did the same.“Well it’s good to know you now see things my way,” she said “the Scottish people demanded a referendum in the general election and it’s only right we should have the choice to decide to have one.” She chose her words carefully but they still came out through gritted teeth. Sturgeon did not want a referendum at all, her real wish was to nurse a sense of grievance about being denied a referendum. Johnson knew her game and Sturgeon now knew Johnson knew it. He was calling her bluff and enjoying the moment almost as much as hearing the election night’s exit poll that told him he had won. Sturgeon would now have to find ways of delaying the actual vote until after the Holyrood elections in , and would have to find some new grievances, and fast.“Oh don’t misunderstand me First Minister” Johnson went on. “When I say there shall be a referendum I mean of course I am recommending it be held under the strictest of terms. Such a constitutional matter is reserved to Westminster and I shall be announcing it must take place within the next six months so there is an end to constitutional wrangling and you can get on with the day job.”“Now that we are getting Brexit done I am intent on healing the country’s deep wounds. I want to build one nation in harmony and at peace with itself.

I’m sure you will agree it is important that as many Scots are given the franchise in such an important decision.”“The question will be set by the Electoral Commission using the terms to “leave or remain” in the United Kingdom, as that phrasing is known to be the least pejorative and most balanced.” Prime Minister Johnson paused to let the First Minister respond.“I don’t find those arrangements at all acceptable, we shall not submit to any imposition. My Scottish Government shall decide who votes on what question and when.” Sturgeon said in full-blown anger, her face screwing up as she spat the words out. Her fists had instinctively clenched and the pencil in her right hand snapped.The Prime Minister was ready for this and replied, “As I said, I am announcing my decision to the country from Downing Street in a few minutes.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. .

Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!!

An exit poll at pm yesterday predicting a possible SNP gain from the Liberal Democrats ultimately proved to be wrong, with a comfortable majority of , for Mr Carmichael in the end.It was Mr Carmichael#s sixth win in the Northern Isles. He has been the MP for the seat since .The Lib Dem used his acceptance speech first to thank the ing officers, the other candidates for a #spirited and good-natured campaign#, his own campaign team, and we and family, who had been #staunch in their support#.He went on to say that representing the people of Orkney and Shetland had been, and remained, his #greatest privilege#.It was more of a #mixed picture#, as Mr Carmichael said prior to his election result announcement, for the Lib Dems across the board.The party were unable to capitalise on their strong anti-Brexit message in this election, making a net loss of one seat across the UK. They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives. Targeting leave-voting Labour areas seems to have paid off for the Prime Minister.Labour lost  seats on the night, prompting leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce that he intends to stand down.Their candidate Coilla Drake called it a #sad, sad day#.Mr Carmichael also used his acceptance speech to criticise Mr Johnson and his incoming government.#The next five years is going to be a dficult and dangerous for this, our United Kingdom,# he said.The newly re-elected MP, however, ended on an almost hopeful note, focusing on the need for #liberal voices#, unity and solidarity, which he said was #greater than ever before#.The turnout for the Orkney and Shetland election was just under  per cent, with , Northern Isles folk voting. raquoSo , how did the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies work out for them  Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result. One hopes they are satisfied.Our Lord#s admonition, #Reap as ye have sown,# springs readily to mind.Strange # I thought the SNP was a Remain party!I love Shetland  Orkney! As a Swede I feel a strong fellowship. Hope the outcomewon#t tarnish it.No Brian, the SNP only say they want to Remain, as a stick to beat Westminster with.Their defining policy, independence, was guaranteed to take us out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on independence Day. The EU has confirmed this #repeatedly#.They also know they would be unable to rejoin until we satisfy the EU#s onerous conditions, notably:. Austerity to cut necessary borrowing within EU Stability and Growth Pact guidelines. .Establish our own central bank and currency # this will take nine years .. Hand the EU control of our economy and trade, agriculture and fisheries.Throw in control ofenergy and our military and Scots will never vote for it. They know that, too. So expect a policy switch, replacing EU membership with EFTA. . It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit. It was well under way, long before Brexit. So back to my original point.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

Kezzie, the -year-old Border Collie who is around  years old in human years, might be more refined in age but getting her forever home has given her a new lease of le.Nuala Wilson, who has been a supporter of Dogs Trust for some time, had been searching for a canine companion with her partner Lance. They had seen Kezzie’s pictures on the Dogs Trust website and wanted to meet her.Nuala said: “We visited the Rehoming Centre, where all the other dogs were so excited and lively in their kennels. Kezzie just seemed so relaxed and we got the chance to meet and play with her.“Despite being an older dog, she has the heart of a puppy and I personally believe she chose us as her new owners as much as we chose her. Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and although she is on a special diet for her tummy, she will get some tummy friendly treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, Assistant Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said:“We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family.“Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies skyrocket by % in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. Our slogan, A dog is for le, not just for Christmas, is still very relevant and a reminder to think carefully about the lelong commitment of getting a pet before making the decision.“If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Visit www.dogstrust.org.uk adogisforle to find out more about fostering, sponsoring a dog and for advice on dog ownership.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"irish premier among scores of christmas day dippers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

was in , going from  to .Cork has seen a % increase, with  methadone users in , and  in .Users in Co Tipperary have increased from  to , and in Co Waterford they rose from  to . \"  Counties such as

and , women.The majority of people in the programme are aged  years and over.Sinn Fein TD for Cork North Central Jonathan O’Brien has raised the issue of the ever-growing problem of heroin in Cork City with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and says additional Gardai resources to fight heroin supply gangs and improved addiction supports is the best way to tackle the issue.“These figures are worrying for a number of reasons,” he said.“Firstly they show that more and more people are seeking treatment for heroin addiction, which is positive, but they also show up the failure in drugs policy to trying to get iniduals into treatment programmes.“There is simply not enough resources being put into the services a recovering addict needs, le skills, counselling to address underlying mental health issues and living arrangements.“Putting people on methadone should be a short term stop gap measure to allow adequate services be put in place such as residential detox beds and rehab.“We are just replacing one addiction with another and some addicts will argue that methadone is harder to detox from than Heroin.“You’ll also note that the age profile of those on methadone is rising indicating that people are on methadone years and not enough is being done to help iniduals beat their addiction.”Dr Garrett McGovern, an addiction specialist in Priority Medical Clinic, says that the numbers of those using methadone have remained steady.“They have been in and around , for over  years now and the lack of movement generally relates to lack of treatment expansion outside Dublin,” he said.“Opioid substitution treatmentis the most effective intervention for heroin addiction with over five decades of research supporting its use.“The longer a patient stays on it the more protective it is against

bpanews_feb-ea-f-d-aabb_EmailChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study..pushScientists have found that listening to music prompts the primates to perform rhythmic movements such as swaying, hand-clapping and foot-tapping.The researchers say that understanding more about the predisposition of these great apes to music could shed light on how humans came to appreciate melodies.Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga, of Kyoto University in Japan, studied seven chimpanzees who were exposed to six two-minute piano compositions for six days.They found that while the music was being played, the chimps swayed their bodies and bobbed their heads and, sometimes, went as far as clapping their hands and tapping their feet.The team also found that male chimpanzees were more likely to respond to the tunes by being more vocal and swaying rhythmically for longer durations compared with their female counterparts.In their paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers noted: “Given that humans do not have such a sex dference in musical ability, higher sensitivity to sound in male chimpanzees may have been acquired after chimpanzees erged from the common ancestor shared with humans.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A male chimpanzee making a rhythmic display at the enclosure in the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University “This may also be associated with their patriarchal society, where male chimpanzees often collaborate to protect their territory and group members.”To understand more about their musical inclination, the researchers selected the chimpanzee most responsive to the music.They then exposed the animal, called Akira, to additional musical sessions, with four two-minute experiences for  days.The researchers found that both random and regular beats induced rhythmic swaying in Akira.The movements were more pronounced when Akira was standing on two feet rather than on all fours, which the researchers believe could be down to the chimpanzee having a greater flexibility in the bipedal posture.In addition, Akira also stayed longer in the area where music was playing, indicating that the chimpanzee actively sought musical stimulation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The chimpanzee enclosure at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University According to the authors, the findings point to a foundation for dancing in a common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.The team wrote in the paper: “In humans, listening to music induces rhythmic movement, suggesting a close connection between the auditory and motor areas in the brain.“These results suggest that prerequisites for music and dance are deeply rooted and existed in the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, approximately six million years ago.”Meanwhile, in a separate study also published in Pnas, scientists have found that chimpanzees share tools with each other and teach their fellow beings new skills so they are able to perform complex and challenging food-hunting tasks.Researchers in the US say that this act of sharing tools and skills in chimpanzees is similar to that seen in humans."},{"url":null,"title":"monkeys enjoy specially baked mince pies ahead of christmas at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in .

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates. The site at the Ministry of Defence base will encompass four pitches, a MUGA and an administration and exhibition museum centre. Down GAA will now plan to appoint a Project Board in the New Year.Maureen OrsquoHigginswas elected as the new vice-chairperson of the board, on an evening when a number of officerships changed hands.Outgoing chairman Sean Rooney was selected to represent the county on the Ulster Council alongside Sean McCashin. Donal McNallywill assume the position of Irish and Cultural Officer, while Drumgathrsquos Michael McArdle is the new delegate to Central Council.As a result of disciplined financial management in recent years, the presentation of the financial report by treasurer Diarmuid Cahill showed a strong position for the county moving forward.Fourteen motions on the convention agenda were all approved, including ten proposals to go forward to the GAA Congress in Dublin at the end of February. These include: points deduction as a penalty option for a breach of the rule on lsquomisconduct considered to have discredited the association removing the rule which allows a newly-transferred player to finish playing in a competition he had started with his former club a  month hiatus on a further transfer for a player after his transfer has been granted adult inter-club championship games to be extended to  minutes per half.Convention also approved a proposal for the GAA to engage with RTEacute on extending their TV competition provisions to allow entry from viewers in Northern Ireland.Officers elected at the  annual convention: chairman, John Devaneyvice-chairperson, Maureen OrsquoHigginssecretary: Seaacuten Oacuteg McAteer treasurer, Diarmuid Cahillassistant secretary, Michael OrsquoRourkeassistant treasurer, Brendan FitzpatrickPRO, Fiona MurphyDevelopment Officer, Willie GribbenIrish and Culture Officer, Donal McNallyCentral Council delegate, Michael McArdleUlster Council delegates, Sean Rooneyand Sean McCashin ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick couple enjoy 65 years of marital bliss  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK couple whose introduction was gently engineered by the husband-to-bersquos mother will celebrate  years of marriage on Saturday.Muriel and Alan Major will be surrounded by family and friends when they mark their blue sapphire anniversary.Muriel and Alan, who are both  and from Saul Road, admit they found a ldquogem in each other.They credit their long and happy marriage to a shared love of musicand the arts and never allowing a disagreement to remain too long without making up.The couple say that they have been blessed with three sons, Glenn, Richard and Ian, two grandchildren, Hannah and Thomas, and two great-children, Louis and Lila.They were married at the age of  in Ballyphilip Parish Church, Portaferry, by the Rev Lindsay on December ,. Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you. Itrsquos best done before the night is out.ldquoAlso, I say that having a bit of good manners helps, to say thank you and to appreciate what we do for each other..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick man.jpg","title":"Downpatrick man in roll of honour  ","story":"FORMER Downpatrick and Ireland cricket captain Alfie Linehan was included in a prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who died during .He was among  from around the world listed as lsquospecial peoplersquo in BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme broadcast at the weekend.They included England goalkeeper Gordon Banks and racing driver Niki Lauda as well as another cricketer mdash one of Englandrsquos greatest fast bowlers, Bob Willis.Alfie died in June after suffering dementia and contracting cancer.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result.

We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Search for missing man called off as body recovered from Belfast Lough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

a comment which follows a year of bitter debates in Parliament and the country over Brexit.She said the message was a reminder of what can be achieved when people abandon their dferences and “come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation”.Her words are likely to be interpreted as an appeal for the healing of isions in the country as Britain leaves the EU.The Queen said in her message: “The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.”Swedish teenager Greta’s activism has sparked a global climate strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters across the world protest by refusing to go to classes.She addressed a UN summit on the issue in September, telling world leaders they had failed to act.“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said.Her efforts were acknowledged by the Duke of Cambridge who said climate activists were ringing the “planetary alarm bell louder”.The Queen also spoke about personal joy, describing how she and the Duke of Edinburgh were “delighted” to welcome an eighth great-grandchild to their family - Harry and Meghan’s son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - born  years after Queen Victoria.In pictures: The Christmas Day royal outing to church at Sandringham Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"As the Queen spoke viewers saw a photograph, released a few days after Archie’s birth on May , which captured the moment she and the Duke of Edinburgh saw Archie for the first time as his proud parents and grandmother Doria Ragland looked on.The Christmas message, produced by the BBC, was recorded in Windsor Castle’s green drawing room after the General Election but before Philip was admitted to a private London hospital for treatment for a pre-existing but undisclosed condition.The duke spent four nights being treated before he was discharged on Christmas Eve morning, in time to join the royal family celebrations at Sandringham.In her message to the country and Commonwealth the Queen mentioned the carol It Came Upon The Midnight Clear - performed at the end of the broadcast.She added: “Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels’ message of peace and goodwill.“It’s a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.“And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.”A string of milestones marked during  were mentioned by the Queen, from the th anniversary of the D-Day landings to the th anniversary of the first moon landing.She began her address by highlighting its theme of “small steps” as she spoke about the Apollo  mission.“As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind,” said the Queen.She added: “It’s a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps.”Nearby was a picture of the Queen meeting Armstrong and his Apollo  crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.Speaking about D-Day, the Queen mentioned the “look of concern on my father’s face” as King George VI knew about the secret plans but could not “share that burden”.Seventy-five years on from the historic landings, she said former enemies had met in friendship at commemorations marking the anniversary in Britain and on the continent.The Queen added: “Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.“Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.“By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.”During the broadcast footage was shown of America’s moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the alliance’s th anniversary.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patrick’s Day with the Irish Guards.Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that “small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences”, the Queen added: “Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps.“The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference.”The Queen’s comment about experiencing a “bumpy” year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past  months.During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender.The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation “safe and secure”.At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legion’s Together at Christmas initiative.try catch  TrendingNI road remains closed this morning after man dies in serious road traffic collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonNI pizza restaurant to create  new jobsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
