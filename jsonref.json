9 months office Approval just 42","story":"Share this article Bill Sullivan, executive vice president for advocacy with the American Trucking Associations, a trade group, said that any National Guard members with a commercial driver\u0027s license are likely already driving trucks. \u0027And the freight network is private, so which company\u0027s products would the National Guard haul?\u0027 Sullivan said in a statement, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u0027While we understand why elected officials are looking at all possible authorities to help, deploying the Guard to haul freight isn\u0027t feasible and would only further complicate the current situation.\u0027 Meanwhile, haulage companies are offering six-figure salaries and $15,000 sign-on bonuses while struggling to attract 80,000 new drivers who are needed to relieve the nation\u0027s supply crisis.White House advisers were forced to clarify a comment Biden made that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by China, in breach of a longstanding policy that states otherwise.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he responded when asked in a CNN town hall about defending Taiwan. \u0027We have a commitment to that.\u0027Biden\u0027s statement was at odds with the long-held US policy known as \u0027strategic ambiguity,\u0027 where Washington helps build Taiwan\u0027s defenses but does not explicitly promise to come to the island\u0027s help in the event of an attack. After Thursday\u0027s town hall, a White House spokesperson said Biden was not announcing any change in US policy. \u0027The US defense relationship with Taiwan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act. \u0027We will uphold our commitment under the act, we will continue to support Taiwan\u0027s self-defense, and we will continue to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo,\u0027 the spokesperson said. Speaking to reporters earlier on Thursday, China\u0027s United Nations ambassador, Zhang Jun, said the country was pursuing \u0027peaceful reunification\u0027 with Taiwan and responding to \u0027separatist attempts\u0027 by its ruling Democratic Progressive Party.\u0027We are not the troublemaker,\u0027 he said, although Taiwan has repeatedly insisted it has no desire to \u0027reunite\u0027 with China, and wishes to retain its status as an independent democracy. \u0027On the contrary, some countries – the US in particular – is taking dangerous actions, leading the situation in Taiwan Strait into a dangerous direction.\u0027Dragging Taiwan into a war definitely is in nobody\u0027s interest.\u0027Biden made a similar pledge to protect Taiwan in August during an interview with ABC, insisting that the United States would always defend key allies, including Taiwan, despite the withdrawal from Afghanistan in the face of the victorious Taliban.That withdrawal was seized on by critics as evidence that Biden would be soft on defending allies, and saw him accused of potentially emboldening Chinese President Xi Jinping\u0027s vow to re-take Taiwan.  Biden said the United States made a \u0027sacred commitment\u0027 to defend NATO allies in Canada and Europe and it\u0027s the \u0027same with Japan, same with South Korea, same with Taiwan.\u0027The White House subsequently told reporters that US policy on Taiwan \u0027has not changed.\u0027Asked by an audience member Thursday about China\u0027s rapidly-growing military might, Biden said: \u0027Don\u0027t worry about whether... they\u0027re going to be more powerful.\u0027\u0027China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world.\u0027However, Biden expressed concern that rival countries may \u0027engage in activities where they may make a serious mistake.\u0027He referred to his longtime relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and repeated his position that he does not want \u0027to start a new Cold War with China.\u0027But he warned: \u0027I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back.\u0027adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})Advertisement"},{"url":null,"title":"Next Met chief Priti Patel actively looks Australia","story":"Share this article Among those who have caught the eye of British ministers is Mick Fuller, the commissioner of New South Wales Police, whose tough-talking style would chime with Miss Patel’s approach.Mr Fuller has courted controversy, defending his force’s policy of strip-searching suspects by saying there needs to be ‘a little bit of fear’ of law enforcement.‘People need to know there are consequences, especially those who are criminals or on the verge of being criminals,’ he said.However, Mr Fuller has announced plans to retire next year, meaning the Home Office may have to look elsewhere unless he has a rethink.Another likely candidate is Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll, who oversaw Australia’s biggest peacetime security operation at the G20 summit in Brisbane in 2014.The former drug squad detective was drafted in to overhaul the troubled Queensland Fire and Emergency Service after it was hit by sexism and bullying scandals.Her experience is likely to be of interest to ministers who want the next chief to address allegations that the force suffers from a culture of cover-ups and misogyny.Discussing her experience, she later said: ‘Jumping from an organisation I knew to one I didn’t know – with people who weren’t happy about me coming – was the toughest time of my career.‘But all I could do was be honest and say, “we have to take this organisation forward together”.’Other potential candidates include Reece Kershaw, who worked his way up the ranks to serve as commissioner of the Australian Federal Police since 2019, and Michael Outram, commissioner of the Australian Border Force who is a former detective chief inspector at the Met.Former Australian police commissioner Andrew Colvin is another whose name has been mentioned. He transformed the service with new technologies and has considerable experience in dealing with terrorism, including the 2002 Bali bombings.Ministers have not ruled out a British appointment but are unimpressed with the available candidates.Why knives and forks are off the table for childrenWhen it comes to keeping young children’s table manners up to scratch, parents seem to have a lot on their plate these days.But it appears youngsters have now gained the upper hand in the battle for good behaviour during family meals.For a new study has found more than half of British children do not eat with a knife and fork. A staggering 54 per cent of parents with children aged four to ten admit their children do not use a knife and fork properly at meal times. And 60 per cent of youngsters often eat with just their hands, while nearly a fifth will lick their plate given the chance. The study, by children’s cutlery maker doddl, also found 28 per cent of parents admit their children talk with their mouths full, which they would have been told off for doing at the same age.The study of 1,500 parents found this has effects beyond the family table – as 23 per cent often feel humiliated when at a restaurant with their children. Additionally 46 per cent let youngsters watch TV at the table and 35 per cent let them play with a tablet or phone at meal times.Stacey Zimmels, a speech and language therapist specialising in paediatric feeding, said: ‘The onset of portable screens has replaced the family mealtime in many households’, meaning children ‘can be less exposed to a varied diet and have no demonstration of how to use cutlery’."},{"url":null,"title":"Queens visit COP26 hangs balance monarchs appearance guided doctors","story":"Share this articleQueen\u0027s visit to COP26 climate summit \u0027hanging in balance\u0027 as she waits for test results - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Trade unions tell Sajid Javid adopt Plan B mask wearing WFH","story":"Share this article And the joint statement from trade unions said: \u0027We all want to beat Covid once for all and to avoid further lockdowns. \u0027But without decisive action now, we risk sleepwalking into another winter of chaos.\u0027With hundreds of Covid outbreaks at workplaces being reported to health authorities each week, events feel ominously reminiscent of last winter.\u0027The government must act now to reduce the spread of Covid.

In fact I think there should be a big question mark on Starc’s inclusion in the T20 side, he leaks too many runs.” It’ll be interesting what they do now if they wish to use a second spinner - it felt like Cummins v Hazlewood, but maybe Starc is in the gun now given the other two bowled so well.Out of nowhere, Danny Morrison starts talking about Glenn Maxwell not having a very good IPL in 2020 - he’s got his talking points and he’s going to use them. Watto reminds him of his 2021 dominance.  “After getting used to not knowing how teams for the Hundred were put together it seems a throwback to watch national sides competing in the short format,” writes Ian Copestake. “Is taking time to adapt to the tired old isions.” Fun, isn’t it? Here’s the Maharaj run out, by the way. Wow.  “Morning Adam.” Brian Withington! Always a pleasure to see your name pop up. “The social distancing picket fence pens reminded me of the phrase ‘good fences make good neighbours’. It’s originally taken from the Robert Frost poem ‘Mending Wall’, published in 1914, and the words are attributed to a neighbour in the process of repairing a boundary wall. The poem has been a source of some controversy of interpretation over the years since, with its potential themes of nationalism, Cold War tensions, and immigration. The author raises his own doubts in the lines: With that context it probably won’t surprise you that, where I finished school in the USA, this was a poem we studied closely.“Hi Adam.” Hello to a very happy Simon McMahon. “Just want to say, COME ON SCOTLAND!!! And COME ON ENGLAND!!! And COME ON EVERYONE!!! Can you tell I’m excited? Here’s to a great tournament. SUPER OVERS please!!!”  That’s the spirit. And yes, super overs every couple of days, please.“Morning Adam.” And to you, John Barnes. “Is this typical of the kind of crowds we can expect in the T20 World Cup? I watched the qualifiers and they seemed sparsely attended as well. I’m wondering if there are restrictions in place over there that’s limiting the atmosphere?” Unfortunately, yes, this will be the norm. Good news: the ICC aren’t posting clips but Sky Cricket are. More importantly... is that a top knot on Glenn Maxwell?! Go on!! Crete was glorious, thanks! We managed to snaffle the last of the warm weather, very much needed after a huge English summer. As for the conditions at Abu Dhabi, looks very UAE to me - the forecast says 33 and sticky, as I assume it reads pretty much every day.  Apologies in advance that I won’t be able to post wickets and big moments here from twitter. For reasons that nobody can understand (well, I can give a theory but I won’t) the ICC are only posting those highlights to instagram and facebook, which don’t embed here. Don’t mind this 90s rave music they have playing on the host broadcast. Lean into that, I say - give me a montage to this later. “Good morning Adam from a disappointed Irishman,” writes Dean Kinsella. “I really get your complaint about the big boys and the little boys ide in this tournament but if there must be a pre-qualifying tournament, it has worked well to have it in the week before the tournament proper and in the same conditions. Hopefully the minnows (who have qualified) will have gained a bit of local experience and a bit of momentum before they play against the ‘upper echelons.” I understand that perspective, thanks for sharing it. But surely the experience gained by playing against the best teams in the world in the format of the game with the most volatility makes sense? Back when 16 teams were in this comp, there were plenty of upsets.  Now a package on South Africa about their tortured time at World Cups over the years, both the 50 and 20 over variety. Quite good.  And here are those teams - yep, Australia play both Hazlewood and Cummins alongside Starc, with Zampa the sole spinner. Okay, now that’s off my chest - it’s Australia and South Africa to begin what is to be known as the Super 12s stage - group 1, to be precise. It’s worth noting off the top that neither of these teams have won this competition in its previous six iterations, the Proteas coming in as the 5th ranked team and Aaron Finch’s team 7th.  It’s a point of fascination for many Australian fans that they have been so unsuccessful in the tournament previously known as the World T20. Scanning through the squad this time around, they look to have enough matchwinners on paper, but there remains something amiss with a dreadful recent record. This was reinforced when India gave them a hiding in the second warm-up game. They did account for South Africa away from home in this format immediately before the pandemic, but that feels a lifetime ago - especially to Dave Warner, who is having a dreadful 2021. With Finch only just back from injury, their experienced combination at the top of the order are under the pump. A lot falls onto the shoulders of Glenn Maxwell, who arrives after a stellar IPL campaign for RCB.  Australia are set to go into the game with seven batters and four bowlers, meaning Mitch Marsh (who will bat three after an excellent winter tour of the the West Indies), Marcus Stoinis and Maxwell will need to make up four overs between them. That also means there will only be room for one of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to join Mitch Starc and the spinners Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa. South Africa, by contrast, have been ticking over very nicely in 2021 having won nine of their last ten in this format then saluting in both warm-up games. The great news for Temba Bavuma is that he will have Tabraiz Shamsi at his disposal after passing a fitness test. The left-arm wrist spinner has bowled the house down this year, ranked No1 in the world, but only sent down four balls in the warm-up game against Pakistan before his groin played. But he’s good to go. The big, beautiful Rassie van der Dussen was in the runs against Pakistan - he’s ready to explode in a big tournament like this. Supported by players of vast experience like Quinton de Kock up top and Kagiso Rabada with the new ball - not to mention the express pace of Anrich Nortje - they are clear favourites here. Right, we’re ten minutes away from the toss at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium - back with you then. Between times, drop me a line or ping me a tweet. It’s time for a World Cup!

We have met such a range of different people from all over the world. They became friends more than customers.“We also had a lot of tourists. We had people coming from Canada who would come in every two or three years to see us.”Mrs Byrne was particularly touched last Saturday when an older gentleman came in and recalled buying his first instrument in the shop.“He was very elderly - and I am 89, putting it that way. He was an elderly gentleman, older than me” and he said he had bought his first violin in here eighty years ago. “Isn’t that something? He came in especially to talk to us.”She is proud they have managed to keep the business family owned from when the first Charlie Byrne opened the premises in 1870.They decided to close due to the ill health of her husband Charlie.“We have to mind him so we put family first. We can’t do both. I am nearly sixty years working here.“It is an emotional time but we know we are doing the right thing. My daughter Geraldine and her husband have two little boys and we all live together. Family has to come first.”Mrs Byrne said on the first day of their closing down sale they had queues down the street with musicians playing instruments and creating a festive mood outside the premises.“It was manic. It was like a session. They were playing music all along the street. It was lovely.”Mrs Byrne has enjoyed working alongside her husband Charlie all through the years of their marriage.“We married at the end of 1963 and we worked alongside each other until the Covid (pandemic) hit. We have always worked well together. Before that I was in fishing and shooting.She laughs when she recalls that “Charlie took up fishing and I caught him. I moved from selling fishing tackle to music.”“A lot has happened. We had a fire in 1992 and our daughter Geraldine came in to help us run it then.

Photograph: PA Nightclubs and most music venues reopened on Friday for the first time since March 2020.The latest phase of easing Covid-19 restrictions proceeded despite a marked deterioration in the trajectory of the disease in the Republic over the past fortnight.With some protective measures remaining in place, here’s everything you need to know if you are planning to go out.Q: Do I need to book a ticket if I want to go to a nightclub? From next week, yes. In something of a surprise development on Friday\u0026nbspnight, the Government has decided that from next week all events and nightclubs must be fully ticketed. Tickets must be allocated “in advance” of events taking place.This could be anything from 24 to 72 hours, but we are not sure yet as regulations are being drafted to give effect to the decision.Officials have said ticketing is required for the purposes of contact tracing for all nightclubs and venues.Q: What is the view on the entertainment sector on the requirement for tickets?They are not pleased. Industry groups have described the plans as “disastrous” and “totally unworkable”. There is also still confusion as to how these plans are going to be implemented. So the reaction can be filed, broadly under: “seriously?”Q: Which restrictions have been loosened?Nightclubs and music venues are now effectively able to operate at full capacity having been closed for nearly 600 days. Live music venues can allow up to 1,500 people standing at events, in addition to full seating capacity.Q: Do I need to be vaccinated to attend a nightclublive music event?A digital Covid-19 pass is required for indoor hospitality and events. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said hospitality businesses need to strictly follow requirements to ask customers for vaccination certificates.Q: Do I have to wear a mask in a nightclub?People are asked to wear masks when they are not eating, drinking or dancing. Queuing for drinks at bars and counters is allowed but beverages must be consumed elsewhere on the premises.Q: What time will the venues stay open until?Nightclubs are allowed to remain open late depending on the licence of the inidual premises. The 11.30pm curfew for pubs has also been scrapped.Q: Have all restrictions on restaurantspubs been lifted then?Not quite. Hospitality settings can have multiple table bookings with a maximum of 10 adults per table, as well as five people aged under 18.People can queue at the bar, but they must be socially distanced\u0026nbspand must then return to their table.The guidelines also state physical distancing of at least one metre is considered “best practice” between tables.Q: What about other changes – such as capacity limits for weddings?Since Friday religious services and weddings can proceed without capacity limits but with all other protective measures remaining in place.Q: Will there be a restriction on the numbers allowed at large outdoor events such as concerts or GAA matches?Fixed capacity limits no longer apply for outdoor events\u0026nbspand Covid-19 passes are not needed.However, the guidelines state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place.Q: What about the return to workplaces?The full return to offices is being delayed until next spring in response to rising Covid-19 cases, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Employers should facilitate people working from home, he said, adding that if there are people who really wanted to return to the office, that should be facilitated too “if they can be in an office on their own or socially distanced from other people”.Otherwise, the return to workplaces will continue on a “phased and cautious basis” for “specific business requirements” only.Q: Are there any changes to international travel?The requirements for proof of vaccination, immunity or a negative PCR test will remain in place for international travellers. People will also still be required to fill out a passenger locator form.However, the Government said the mandatory hotel quarantine system for arrivals from certain countries is no longer considered necessary and will be wound down. Mandatory home quarantine requirements will also be removed.Q: When will all remaining Covid-19 restrictions be lifted?The latest recommendations from Nphet to Ministers said restrictions such as mask wearing and social distancing must remain in place until February 2022.Speaking earlier this week, Mr Varadkar said: “The pandemic isn’t over yet. We’re going to have to get through at least another winter before we can say it’s behind us.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"we missed out on our glory years nightclubs reopen after 19 months","story":"It’s been 585 days, 83 weeks or 19 months since the Dublin nightclubs opened their doors.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdClubbers outside Tramline Nightclub in Dublin. Photograph: Garrett WhitePAWhat’s a two-hour queue waiting in line when your social life has been put on hold for 19 months?People started gathering outside Copper Face Jacks, Dublin’s most famousinfamous nightclub, from 7pm on Friday.Coppers, as it is known, is often the last stop on a night, when you are, to quote Aisling from the bestselling series of novels, “out out”, but those who were venturing into a nightclub for the first time since March 2020 were taking no chances when it came to getting in.The club was due to open at 9pm by which time the queue stretched halfway down Harcourt Street meeting another queue several hundred metres long at the side of the venue. The venue holds more than a thousand people. It was full by 9.45pm.Two security staff checked the Covid certificate details of those entering who were only too eager to proffer their mobile phones with the confirmation that they were fully vaccinated.It helped that their certificates doubled up as proof of age. Contact details were also taken.The mood was exuberant. Proportionately, young people have spent far more of their lives in lockdown. They’ve missed birthdays, debs balls, fresher weeks graduation ceremonies and just being young.The street hummed with pent-up energy.“We have missed out, I wouldn’t say on our childhood, but on our middle adulthood. We missed out on our glory years,” said Jack Dunphy (19).Alana Gill (22) from Wexford has not been in a nightclub for two years. “I’m a healthcare worker – a radiographer. I’ve seen the hard end of Covid, but I’m glad to get back in a club eventually. I think it is just the right time. We are all vaccinated and I’m happy.”Lea Marron (22)who arrived with her friend, Cora Ryan, both from Rathfarnham have not been in a nightclub for two years. Lea said: “I’m newly single and I just can’t wait to go out.”Kelda Power (30) said Covid-19 meant she missed the last two years of her twenties. “Turning 30 was huge without going to a nightclub. We are going to make up for it.”The queues for the Tramline club in D’Olier Street were equally as long and stretched around the corner into Hawkins Street.Buses and car drivers passing by honked their horns at those waiting patiently to get in and the crowd reciprocated with loud cheers. Vaccine certificates were checked by ambulance staff on the way in.Tramline is for a younger age cohort between 18 and 20. Many have never been in an adult nightclub before.At the bottom of the stairs into the venue was one of those ubiquitous yellow signs that everybody hopes to never see again.“Stay home, stay safe, protect each other”. None of the 950 were intent on staying home on Friday night. On the contrary they were “out out” and determined to enjoy it.The dancefloor was filled by 10.30pm. The spider webs and skeletons hanging from the ceiling for Halloween billowed under the newly installed air filtering system.“We think 95 per cent of people in here have never been to a proper nightclub before,” said manager Ian Redmond. “They will have memories for the rest of their lives and I’m excited that I’m the guy who is providing it for them.“We are doing this very safely. Everyone has been checked. The staff are all wearing masks. People have been compliant and very responsible.”There was much consternation on social media about the lengthy queues outside nightclubs when Covid-19 cases are creeping up to 2,500 a day at present. “I’d rather them than me,” was a common sentiment for those staying at home, but others felt that young people deserved a night out after being cooped up and confined for so long.If it is good enough for Professor Christine Loscher, an immunologist based in Dublin City University (DCU), for Nphet and for the Government all who support the opening of nightclubs, it is good enough for me, Mr Redmond stated.“The risk of transmission in here is very low. We have to get on with what we have to do,” he declared.The Lost Lane nightclub off Grafton Street had a one way system for drinks and two metres distancing at the bar delineated by yellow signs.Manager David Morrissey said Government guidelines that nightclubs be ticketed events is “unworkable”and will target pubs that have live music sessions in the afternoon.“You arrive into a bar at 8pm. You are having a quick beer and by the time there’s live music, you’ll have to leave if you don’t have a ticket,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics inside ten years as a government advisor with ed brophy","story":"Ed Brophy is a former chief of staff to finance minister Paschal Donohoe and to Labour’s Joan Burton when she was Tánaiste.

Yesterday, the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, responded to Labour criticism of Conservative MPs not wearing masks in the Commons chamber by gleefully pointing out his opponents’ hypocrisy: when Labour MPs were pictured at their own conference, they were seen maskless.I tweeted exactly that observation at the time, my effort being retweeted a few hundred times, including by a few Tory MPs. So, you’re welcome, Jacob.It’s all just so tiresome. Are we really so bereft of issues to debate that our politicians have to play virtuous one-upmanship over the wearing of masks? It’s almost as dull as the annual poppy wars, in which the wearing or not wearing of a poppy is seen as evidence either of jingoistic fanaticism or naïve, unpatriotic pacifism.But Labour’s criticism, and its MPs’ decision to wear masks in the chamber even though such a gesture is not legally required, says something about a section of society’s attitudes to authority. True, there are many who genuinely believe that mask wearing is making a significant contribution to halting the spread of Covid-19, and those people see the example set by Labour MPs as worthy, and the refusal by Conservative MPs to follow suit as irresponsible.But there are others who simply relish the imposition by the state of rules and regulations to control citizens’ behaviour. Shortly after social distancing on board Scottish trains was ended, I sat opposite a young man on a train from Pitlochry to Glasgow. I was wearing a mask (still legally required up here) but this didn’t reassure my fellow passenger, who immediately objected to my sitting at a table intended for four people.Either he selfishly wanted the whole table to himself, or he wrongly believed social distancing was still in effect. But I detected more than simply an ignorance of the changed rules: this was someone who regretted the gradual relaxation of the rules, who would be more comfortable with the restrictions that had previously been enforced, mandating two metre distancing and fining people 200 quid if they looked at anyone straight in the eyes.To be fair, it could be that my fellow passenger was simply genuinely concerned about catching the virus. But there’s no doubt that there are plenty of people around who embraced social distancing and other safety rules, rather than simply accepting them reluctantly as a necessary evil.Maybe it’s just me but I think the latter attitude is by far the healthier. Whenever I’m travelling southwards, I look forward to my train’s arrival in Carlisle where Nicola Sturgeon’s mask mandate no longer applies and I can breathe the free air of England. It’s sensible to respect and observe the law, but just as sensible to celebrate when the law no longer forces you to wear something as damned uncomfortable and claustrophobic as a mask. Labour MPs, it would seem, fall culturally into the category of wishing there were more rules around to restrict our freedom. Presumably, if they’re critical of MPs who are legally choosing not to wear a mask in the chamber, then they believe that such mask wearing should be made legally obligatory. Yet none of them seem to want to press that point. Most strange.Could it be that they are simply trying to score political points by emphasising the uncaring, selfish approach of their opponents? One would hope not. But Rees-Mogg’s (and my) point about Labour MPs choosing to exercise their rights not to wear a mask during their own conference, when many of them knew they would be pictured on TV applauding their leader’s speech to delegates, remains valid. Why was it safe to go commando, as it were, in the conference hall but not in the Commons?It can’t be that Labour fears Tory MPs are presenting a poor example to gullible viewers who watch Prime Minister’s Questions each week for lifestyle tips those same viewers would also have been tuning into the Brighton conference and would have observed a very different example of behaviour.We are left with the unpalatable conclusion that Labour, having been placed at almost every turn on the backfoot during the pandemic, and having failed to make any political headway against Boris Johnson in that time, is still plugging away, more in hope than in expectation, at the idea that voters will at last buy into their mindset that Tories are somehow morally derelict, unlike the saintly Labour Party.I mean, it’s a view. And since nothing else – including this strategy, it has to be said – seems to be working, it’s as well to flog a dead horse as to say nothing at all. If the public really were appalled by Tory MPs not wearing masks in the chamber, if they really thought that Labour were fighting a lonely battle to beat the virus using a suitably ostentatious combination of paper and elastic, wouldn’t the polls suggest that voters are rewarding this strategy?The danger is that voters will see the chamber ided equally between mask-wearers and non-wearers and will, accurately, conclude that everyone is making a political point. The question is whether those viewers naturally yearn for the days of mask mandates or instead prefer the freedom to decide for themselves how best to protect themselves and others. Labour might discover, not for the first time, that its own instincts are out of step with the people it needs to attract. More from NewsParents who are occasionally abrupt with their children may be guilty of \u0026#39mild neglect\u0026#39, says NSPCCThe war on the self-employed will destroy what made Britain greatBritain draws up contingency plans following France\u0026#39s threat to block €10bn EU research programme Angels\u0026#39 Curtis Sliwa: Renegade vigilante lays out plans to shake up New York with mayoral bidWhy I fear the Church of England will not survive for my childrenWatch: Undersea footage shows marine life covered in ash from Canary Island volcano eruptionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public waking costs wests unilateral eco disarmament","story":"As it happens, I shall be 65 on the day the Cop26 meeting opens in Glasgow next week. So I am old enough to remember during my adult life the genesis of the Cop (Conference of the Parties) process which sees itself as the way to save the planet. The occasion also makes me reflect on what causes the public to wake up to any issue.Environmentalism is often seen as a Left-wing cause, but Margaret Thatcher was the first leading world statesman to address global warming. As our first scientist prime minister, she was excited by the theory, propounding it to the Royal Society in 1988. The following year, she argued that the problem could be dealt with only through a global UN framework, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The challenge, she said, was “as great as any disarmament treaty”. She made that comparison because disarmament is worse than useless unless all parties really do disarm.The first Cop met in Berlin, six years later. The fact that there will very soon have been 26 of them suggests the task is not easy.In one sense, the process has been brilliantly successful. No cause in the Western world has more excited the activist young, or been more passionately preached from pulpits, in schoolrooms and on television. Like medieval monarchs blessing the Crusades, our current heir to the throne, and his heir, exhort their future subjects to ever-greater sacrifices for the sake of the planet. “Net zero” is the name for the sacrificial ritual. No mainstream political party dares disagree.Yet these Cops keep copping out. The same basic problem recurs. Nations which industrialised earlier are far readier to reduce carbon emissions than are developing nations, who fear being cheated of economic growth. Because the latter are growing so fast (China and India account for more than a third of all global carbon emissions), there will be no overall carbon reduction unless they “disarm”. They won’t.Indeed, as these rising nations become richer and more assertive, Western persuasiveness weakens. Even Barack Obama failed to achieve consensus at Copenhagen’s Cop15 in 2009. Neither his former vice-president, Joe Biden, nor Boris Johnson, has as much chance in Glasgow next week as he had then. The environmental equivalent of global multilateral disarmament is not happening. The unilateral disarmament of the West is.One person who never accepted the Thatcher remedy was her then chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Faced with a draft for her Royal Society speech proposing universal fuel levies and debt relief for developing countries in return for preserving their rainforests, he wrote, “These bizarre ideas are contrary to Government policy, and are political dynamite.” They were dropped from the speech, but never went away.Twenty years on, the financial crash of 2008-9 gravely injured the West’s authority over how the world is run. Lawson’s short book on climate change, An Appeal to Reason, came out at that time. It tackled IPCC projections for 50 or 100 years hence. These could not have any degree of accuracy, he said: there were too many imponderables. Even on their own calculations, food production was set to rise and people to be several times better off than they were now. Why tighten our belts to help our richer successors?Lawson also emphasised the clash of interests between the West and the rest. Shortly afterwards, Copenhagen exhibited this. The meeting produced vague promises of co-operation and “climate aid” to the developing world, but nothing legally enforceable. Carbon-based energy could not go away, said Lawson, because it was “far and away the cheapest source of energy … and is likely to remain so, not forever, but for the foreseeable future”.These basic arguments have never been disproved. Even if global warming is a very serious problem, why attempt the economically and politically impossible? Why not consider methods of adaptation, rather than cry catastrophe? Lawson and others set up the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Several years later, I joined its board, sitting with people much more expert than I.Over the years, the GWPF has produced work consistently pointing to alternatives – foreshadowing, in 2010, the shale gas revolution, for example – and to problems, such as the danger of depending on emergency gas supplies from Russia (in 2018). The latter is beautifully illustrated by Vladimir Putin’s threat that if we want him in Glasgow, we must accept his gas price “offer”. This week, a new GWPF pamphlet by Gwythian Prins sets out six fallacies of “green growth” and warns of the security implications of letting China manipulate our obsession with net zero while not truly decarbonising.When the GWPF board has met, we have discussed the repressive hostility from policy elites. Those elites have expended enormous energy arguing that we were “climate-change deniers” (a deliberately libellous term, echoing the Holocaust), none on considering what we were saying.Since the problems of the Cop process were so obvious, we puzzled, why did our leaders not admit them? But perhaps the answer was not so hard to see. It is a natural human instinct to side with a virtuous intention and so long as it remains abstract, its virtue will not be proved wrong. Who would not favour a cleaner, greener planet?Rather than honestly confronting the growing practical difficulties, our leaders preferred to frighten the public with the idea of “emergency”. No emergency has been proved: if you want an example of a true emergency, think of Covid in March last year. A climate emergency, on the other hand, is a speculation.On climate policy, we sceptics concluded, minds would change only because of cost. If people were forced to pay substantially more for the essentials of life, they would start asking why.This is now happening, because the emergency’s artificial timetable is making change much more disruptive, expensive and frightening than it need be. People are worried about electric vehicle batteries and charging points, losing wood-burning stoves, being made to pay meat taxes or get rid of gas-fired boilers. In the case of heat pumps, customers face an unprecedented situation of being forced to pay more (through tax, if subsidised) for a technology which is slower and more cumbersome than the one it replaces. Only in recent months have the media in general latched on to what the GWPF and other sceptics have been saying for more than a decade.As I write at home, I can hear men replacing our old gas boilers with new gas boilers. I am determined to install something that actually works before the law forbids it. In the name of a distant, uncertain benefit for mankind in general, we are about to take direct hits on our pockets, our convenience and our country’s prosperity. How can I feel warm towards a government which will make me colder and poorer?Higher energy prices close in, and the public are trapped. A letter from our gas supplier this week announces a rise of 9 pence per litre (over 15 per cent) – but I still need a fuel I can trust. Our Government’s failure to recognise how much we need fossil fuels until such time as carbon-neutral, affordable, 24-hour alternative technologies can successfully operate, is driving up demand for those wicked old carbon-producers, and therefore their price.The government is also trapped politically and diplomatically, seeking to show off, in Glasgow, a virtue that does not impress large parts of the global or, increasingly, the domestic audience. Our rising enemies in the world, if they attend Cop26 at all, will be laughing at us.More from NewsParents who are occasionally abrupt with their children may be guilty of \u0026#39mild neglect\u0026#39, says NSPCCThe war on the self-employed will destroy what made Britain greatBritain draws up contingency plans following France\u0026#39s threat to block €10bn EU research programme Angels\u0026#39 Curtis Sliwa: Renegade vigilante lays out plans to shake up New York with mayoral bidWhy I fear the Church of England will not survive for my childrenWatch: Undersea footage shows marine life covered in ash from Canary Island volcano eruptionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germany really isnt progressive trailblazer wants us think","story":"It has been dubbed “Screw, Promote, Fire” or “the Reichelt system”. Julian Reichelt, the editor of Germany’s biggest tabloid, Bild, would allegedly message new female trainees over Instagram to invite them for dinner. What followed was a whirlwind affair, successive promotions and then the fall from grace.But this week, it was Mr Reichelt who found out what it was like to fall. The original allegations about him were published by Der Spiegel magazine in March, but after they were picked up and further investigated by The New York Times this week, Bild’s owner Axel Springer gave the editor the chop.Springer, you see, has big ambitions for its US political site Politico and American corporate culture does not take kindly to these sorts of shenanigans.In much of Germany, by contrast, such misdemeanours are seen as small matters. After Der Spiegel’s investigation, Mr Reichelt was only given a slap on the wrist. It seems that the matter was no threat to business until it went transatlantic.There are two faces to Germany. The one we hear most about is the lofty progressive side, which constantly lectures other countries about tolerance and following the rules. Then there’s the rest of the country: corrupt, rigid and, in some parts, conservative to the point of backwards. Women are paid less relative to men than in most of Europe, far fewer of them go to university and vanishingly few major German businesses have many women at the top. So it’s not as if the Bild scandal came out of nowhere.Of course there is nothing surprising about older, powerful men using their status to sleep around. But there is a difference between that and what appeared to be an institutionalised company harem system in which sex determines pay and promotions (Springer denies that the problems at Bild reflect anything about its wider culture).Bild was the first to condemn poor treatment of women and polygamy among Muslim migrants to Germany and a few years ago the paper even published (and then retracted) a fabricated story about an Arab “mob’s” mass assault on women. Perhaps the paper should have looked first at protecting women closer to home.Still, despite its prudishness, the United States is no stranger to scandal. The Wall Street Journal has just published new allegations about Bill Gates. The Microsoft founder was apparently sending flirty emails to a woman in middle management a decade ago until Microsoft’s lawyer told him to cut it out – a storyline more suited to David Brent than the world’s once-richest man.In America, these things have traditionally been policed by litigation, which in effect can mean the richest party can act with impunity. Now, though, there’s a new weapon: public shame. That in turn has brought about a shift in legal customs. Dirty old men have to be more careful.On the topic of disgrace, the former health secretary Matt Hancock was subjected to a fresh round of public embarrassment last week after his job offer from the UN to advise developing countries on Covid recovery was withdrawn.Various reasons have been given, like the realisation that the UK’s Covid record was perhaps not one to emulate, or the custom that currently elected officials aren’t meant to take UN jobs (they are reserved for unemployed jet-setters, like Mark Carney and Tony Blair).Nowhere did the UN appear to consider the rank hypocrisy of employing a man who broke his own lockdown rules to advise poorer countries on governance. Perhaps they thought he would fit right in in the aid industry.More from NewsParents who are occasionally abrupt with their children may be guilty of \u0026#39mild neglect\u0026#39, says NSPCCThe war on the self-employed will destroy what made Britain greatBritain draws up contingency plans following France\u0026#39s threat to block €10bn EU research programme Angels\u0026#39 Curtis Sliwa: Renegade vigilante lays out plans to shake up New York with mayoral bidWhy I fear the Church of England will not survive for my childrenWatch: Undersea footage shows marine life covered in ash from Canary Island volcano eruptionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph2","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Saturday.

Follow Covid news - live: NHS chiefs urge government to implement winter ‘plan B’Figures show that the number of people testing positive for coronavirus currently stands at more than 40,000 per day. Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"every uk household would 320","story":"Every UK household would get £ this winter in Green Party plan - funded by landlordsIn their first speech to the Green Party conference, leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay demanded a bumped-up, one-off Winter Fuel Payment - funded by a huge windfall hit to landlordsFamilies are facing a cost of living crisis Image: Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsEvery UK household should get £ this winter funded by landlords to help fund soaring fuel bills, the Green Party said today. New leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay demanded a bumped-up, one-off Winter Fuel Payment to be extended to every household in the country this year. It would come on top of the existing Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners and certain benefit claimants, worth between £ and £. That means people would be eligible for a maximum of £, the Green Party said, to help them cope with rises in the cost of living. It would be funded by a one-off, £billion windfall tax on all landlords of privately-rented homes - charging % of the value of their land. This is not the same as the value of the property itself, and can be less, but further figures were not immediately available. The co-leaders were due to announce the policy in their first speech to the Green Party conference this afternoon.  I comes after the energy price cap was hiked by £ on October , with another larger hike expected in April and energy firms pushing for a third hike in the middle of winter. Mr Ramsay said: “It’s a costed proposal to be funded from a one-off % land-value tax on residential landlord properties. “This proposal is about keeping households from spiralling into fuel poverty, it’s about keeping people safe. “It’s about the state responding to market failure. It’s about human dignity. “Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership. It’s an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand - something they just don’t get. It’s also just a bridge to get us to the tough work of a real, Green New Deal.” Green Party officials believe the scheme - essentially a form of universal basic income - could be a “bridge” to their pledge to invest £billion a year in a Green New Deal. The party has pledged to cut UK carbon emissions to net zero by , two decades earlier than the government’s current pledge. Ms Denyer was expected to say in the joint speech: “People have grown tired of choosing the ‘least worst’ option. Of being patronised, ignored and told what to think. We are tired of a Tory government playing ide and rule. Tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people. Tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys club serving the interests of its pals. We need better - we demand better. We see none of it from an official opposition that fails the public, ignores the votes of its own members, and can’t take a stand on the biggest issues of the day.

He was later made a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords, which is today debating a Bill that will enable terminally ill adults to legally seek assistance to end their lives. Peers heard Lord Field - who campaigned against bereavement benefit cuts as chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee - was unable to attend today’s debate, having spent time recently in a hospice. Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher, who is leading the Bill, said: “Our colleague Lord Field of Birkenhead, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.” The statement from Lord Field said: “I’ve just spent a period in a hospice and I’m not well enough to participate in today’s debate. If I had been, I would have spoken strongly in favour of the second reading [of the Bill]. “I changed my mind on assisted dying when an MP friend was dying of cancer and wanted to die early, before the full horror effects set in, but was denied this opportunity. A major argument against the Bill is unfounded. It is thought by some the culture would change and people would be pressured into ending their lives. Do you support assisted dying  Join the debate in the Commons below.  The numbers of assisted deaths in the US and Australia remains very low, under %, and a former Supreme Court judge in Victoria, Australia, about pressure from relatives, said: ’It just hasn’t been an issue’. I hope the House will today vote for the Assisted Dying Bill.

The Assisted Dying Bill, tabled by Baroness Meacher, proposes that only terminally ill patients with full mental capacity, and are not expected to live more than six months would be eligible to apply for an assisted death. Campaigners argue that a change in the law would give those at the end of their lives greater control over how and when they die. Heartbroken Tory peer Michael Forsyth admitted he will back the bill after his dying father changed his mind. Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, told BBC Radio : “Just before he died I went to see him and said aposIaposm so sorry, dad, youaposre in this positionapos, and he completely took me aback by saying aposwell, youaposre to blame, because you and others have consistently voted against the right to die, I would like to be relieved of this, they canapost relieve the pain and I am in this position because of folk like you.”  However opponents, including many religious leaders, warned that it could leave vulnerable people exposed to unwanted pressure. The Archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the BBC that although the safeguards in the legislation were stronger than in previous attempts to change the law, they still did not go far enough. What we want is assisted living, not assisted dying. “There is no dference between us in compassion.” The topic is being debated today in Parliament for the first time in six years. Previous attempts to introduce similar laws have all been defeated. Dame Prue Leith has backed the bill and slammed critics of “scaremongering” families. Writing in the , she said: “Opponents to the Bill fear that grasping children will coerce dying parents to get their doctors to see them off so they can inherit. If someone is going to die within six months anyway, which must be the case to qualy for assistance to die, why would anyone risk prosecution to get the money a few months earlier  This is despite her son, Tory MP Danny Kruger campaigning against the change in law. Mr Kruger set up the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well. Mr Johnson is not expected to back the plans and it is unlikely to become law without government support.

We weren’t poor but we certainly weren’t rich either. So I understand dferent political perspectives that people have. My family would’ve been Conservative voters from modest backgrounds. Most of my friends and people I met in university were labour voters, and thataposs where a lot of our voters have come from. Describing her middle-class upbringing, Ms Ramsay admitted she didnapost know her parentaposs political stance but insisted her strong principles led her to the party and help unite the party. I was part way through my engineering degree when I had a kind of epiphany about really quite how bad climate change is. Over the summer holidays it really hit me like a train. After that summer Ms Ramsay felt she had a duty to begin campaigning for the environment, social justice and human rights. It comes as the party said every UK household should get £ this winter funded by landlords to help fund soaring fuel bills, at their conference. The co-leaders demanded a bumped-up, one-off Winter Fuel Payment to be extended to every household in the country this year. It would come on top of the existing Winter Fuel Payment for pensioners and certain benefit claimants, worth between £ and £.

The second reading of the Assisted Dying Bill, was unopposed in the Lords, and is set to be scrutinised by a committee. The bill, tabled by cross-bench peer Baroness Meacher, proposes that only terminally ill patients with full mental capacity, and are not expected to live more than six months would be eligible to apply for an assisted death. Former MP Frank Field was one of many peers to back a law, as it was announced he is terminally ill. The -year-old represented Birkenhead for Labour for almost  years, before forming his own party and losing the seat in the  election. Peers heard Lord Field - who campaigned against bereavement benefit cuts as chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee - was unable to attend today’s debate, having spent time recently in a hospice.  Cross-bench peer Baroness Meacher, who is leading the Bill, said: “Our colleague Lord Field of Birkenhead, who is dying, asked me to read out a short statement.” The statement from Lord Field said: “I’ve just spent a period in a hospice and I’m not well enough to participate in today’s debate. If I had been, I would have spoken strongly in favour of the second reading [of the Bill]. Lord Curry of Kirkharle was one of several peers to draw upon personal experience as he spoke against the Assisted Dying Bill. The Cross-bench peer explained: Eight years ago my we and I held the hands of our daughter, aged , who had a learning disability, while she passed from time into eternity. “She breathed her last while we held her hands, a very emotional and precious moment for us. Not an experience one envisages when bringing a child into the world. “Six years before that she was very, very ill with pneumonia and other complications, and wasnapost expected to survive. Cross-bench peer Lord Krebs offered his support and explained how the death of his father had shaped his thinking. And heartbroken Tory peer Michael Forsyth admitted he will back the bill after his dying father changed his mind.Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, told BBC Radio : “Just before he died I went to see him and said aposIaposm so sorry, dad, youaposre in this positionapos, and he completely took me aback by saying aposwell, youaposre to blame, because you and others have consistently voted against the right to die, I would like to be relieved of this, they canapost relieve the pain and I am in this position because of folk like you.” Critics of the Bill could seek to block it at committee stage by tabling several amendments. Opponents included many religious leaders, who warned that it could leave vulnerable people exposed to unwanted pressure. The Archbishop, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said that although the safeguards in the legislation were stronger than in previous attempts to change the law, they still did not go far enough. What we want is assisted living, not assisted dying. There is no dference between us in compassion.” It is common for private members’ bills in the Lords to be given a second reading although it still has several stages to clear and will need to fight for time in the parliamentary schedule. Justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar said the Government was adopting a position of “neutrality” for the Bill, adding it would “not stand in the way” should Parliament ultimately approve the proposed reforms. He added the Bill is an “issue of conscience” for all parliamentarians. The topic was debated today in Parliament for the first time in six years. Previous attempts to introduce similar laws have all been defeated. Disabled campaigners were expected to protest outside Parliament but it was called off last night over Covid fears. Dame Prue Leith has backed the bill and slammed critics of “scaremongering” families. Writing in the , she said: “Opponents to the Bill fear that grasping children will coerce dying parents to get their doctors to see them off so they can inherit. “If someone is going to die within six months anyway, which must be the case to qualy for assistance to die, why would anyone risk prosecution to get the money a few months earlier  This is despite her son, Tory MP Danny Kruger campaigning against the change in law. Mr Kruger set up the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well. Mr Johnson is not expected to back the plans and it is unlikely to become law without government support. Downing Street has said the Government continues to regard the issue of assisted dying as a matter of conscience for inidual MPs and peers.  This is obviously a very emotional issue,” a No  spokesman said. “The Government’s position on assisted dying has not changed. “This is a matter for inidual conscience. Any change in the law is for Parliament to decide rather than Government policy.” Earlier in the day, hundreds of protesters protested outside of Parliament in support of the Bill. Speaking about the urgent need for reform, Humanists UK’s Chief Executive Andrew Copson stressed the inequalities of the current law which enables those with the financial means of travelling to Switzerland to avoid unnecessary suffering. He added: ‘We’re delighted the Assisted Dying Bill has passed its Second Reading.This Bill is limited to adults with terminal illnesses and therefore does not go as far as we’d wish to see, which would mean covering the incurably suffering as well.Nonetheless, we fully support it as a step in the right direction. And its reception in the House of Lords today was a signicant victory for the rights and choices of those in desperate need of a change in the law.

Councils in England will be able to use the funding to support low-income earners who are behind on their rent, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communitiessaid. However, organisations representing landlords and people at risk of homelessness said the money will not be enough to help everyone struggling, and called for the Government to go further. The funding is in addition to a £ million package announced in September to help families struggling to afford food, energy, water and other essentials. This, too, was described as insufficient to meet the scale of the challenge facing low-income families as living costs rise. Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing Eddie Hughes said: We have taken action throughout the pandemic to support the most vulnerable families, and it is vital we continue to provide support as we enter the winter months. This new funding will support families that are struggling and help to get them back on their feet as we begin to recover from the Covid- pandemic.  DLUHC said the Government is grateful to landlords for their support and the funding will help more of them reach agreements with existing tenants. Some . million households on low incomes are estimated to be in arrears with household bills, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation . Around , are thought to be in rent arrears, . million are behind on council tax bills and . million are behind on electricity and gas bills, the foundation said. It looked at households in the bottom % of incomes in the UK, with a household income of £, or less. This represents around . million households.The findings suggest that a thirdof low-income households are now in arrears - triple the % estimated by a similar study before the coronavirus pandemic, the JRF said. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said: We of course welcome this funding that should help keep some of those most at risk of homelessness off the streets this winter. It is now vital councils use this funding to help people most at risk of losing their home. But with almost a million households across the UK in rent arrears and the cost of living rising rapidly, it is impossible for this funding to meet the demand we face. To prevent homelessness in the first place, we desperately need the UK government to ensure that housing benefit covers the true cost of renting by unfreezing the Local Housing Allowance. Chris Norris, policy director for the National Residential Landlords Association, said: We welcome the announcement of this funding and urge local authorities to target it at those tenants most struggling with Covid rent debts. It is great news that those households worst hit by Covid-related arrears may be able to access financial support. However, £ million does not fully reflect the scale of the problem. NRLA analysis has put the figure of Covid rent debts at over £ million. With warnings that rent debts could pose a risk to the economic recovery and the Government admitting that many landlords are highly vulnerable to arrears the Chancellor must go further. Lord John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, said: I am very pleased to hear the Government has listened to our call to keep people in their homes and stop mass homelessness. It is vital that they are taking preventative action to ensure people will not be left homeless this winter. The end of furlough and the lt of the eviction ban have posed a very grave danger to everyday families and iniduals who are struggling to make ends meet as a result of Covid- poverty. This is certainly a welcome announcement, however there is £ million in rent arrears in the UK currently, so far greater action will be needed to stop a catastrophic rise in homelessness. We have seen brilliant and bold action taken by this government during the Everyone In programme and the Job Retention Scheme. I hope we see more of this over the next few months. Although one of our calls to the Government has been observed in part here, we desperately need to see investment in jobs and training in sustainable industries as part of the long-term solution. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: The Covid crisis saw incomes plummet and debts spiral. People have struggled to keep their heads above water, with the protections from the eviction ban and furlough now ended, the threat of homelessness is very real. With winter approaching, the Government is absolutely right to act to keep people safe in their homes and prevent a wave of evictions and homelessness. For those who can access it, this funding will be a leline.

It comes amid claims the rollout has been too slow. Data from the Office for National Statisticsshowed about one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to October , up from one in  the previous week.  In Wales, infection levels were unchanged, but have dropped in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The daily number of infections soared above , this week for the first time in three months. And daily Covid hospitalisations breached , for the first time in six weeks on Friday. Separate figures showed a further  people in the UK had died within  days of testing positive for Covid-, bringing the official UK total to ,.  The former head of England’s coronavirus vaccine delivery drive has been drafted back into the job from Downing Street amid rising concern over the rates of coronavirus heading into winter. Dr Emily Lawson had been behind the original success of the rollout of the Covid- jabs, but was seconded to No ’s delivery unit – a team in charge of ensuring the Government delivers on its policies – in April. But now, in a move which could indicate the pressure ministers expect the NHS to come under this winter, Dr Lawson has ed to the health service as it steels itself for the winter months.In an interview with the Times, Mr Sunak echoed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had previously said another lockdown was aposnot on the cards at allapos.The Chancellor said the country could notto “signicant economic restrictions” and that the vaccine rollout meant this was not necessary. He said: I think weaposre just in a very dferent place to where we were a year ago because of the vaccine. Thereaposs this enormous wave of protection, and that changes things. Thataposs our first line of defence. He added: Thereaposs a range of options that are available, and those are not options that involve lockdowns or very signicant economic restrictions. It comes as scientic advisers told the Government that it must ensure “Plan B” restrictions to tackle coronavirus can be “rapidly” deployedneeded. Experts on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessaid in minutes of a meeting published on Friday that a further huge spike in infections as seen in January was “increasingly unlikely”, as experts predicted a series of broader, flatter peaks as the virus continues to spread.  However, in its meeting dated October , Sage warned that measures from the Government’s Plan B would have greatest effectbrought in in unison and earlier on rather than later. Scientists are in favour of a relatively light-touch approach, implemented earlier to make a dference, with Sage saying the “reintroduction of working-from-home guidance is likely to have the greatest inidual impact on transmission out of the proposed measures” in Plan B, which also includes the mandatory use of face masks. The group also advised that “policy work on the potential reintroduction of measures should be undertaken now so that it can be ready for rapid deployment”. The Prime Minister also said on Friday that another lockdown was not planned. On a visit to a vaccination centre in west London, Mr Johnson was asked whether a full lockdown with “stay at home” advice and shops closing was out of the question this winter, and he replied: “I’ve got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that’s on the cards at all.” However, messaging urging people eligible to get the Covid booster jabs was being ramped up amid a lower enthusiasm than for the initial doses.In a video posted on Twitter, Mr Johnson said: “This pandemic isn’t over and the danger hasn’t gone away. Cold weather helps the virus to spread and winter is a time when our NHS is under pressure anyway, so it’s just as vital to get your boosteryou are called as it was to get your first and second jabs.”The rollout of the first and second doses of the coronavirus vaccine across the country has been widely celebrated, however the uptake of booster vaccines has not been as swt. Fewer than half of eligible residents in older age care homes in England have received a coronavirus booster jab, the latest available NHS data suggests. An estimated . million booster doses of Covid- vaccine have been delivered in the UK. It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster.

But halting it doesnt come for free - and it looks like everyone will have to stump upNearly three-quarters of drivers would be more likely to buy an electric carmore supermarkets had charging points Image: Nathan Stirk Getty ImagesByRachel Wearmouth:,  Oct | commentsBoris Johnson has finally unveiled his strategy for the UK to reach net zero carbon emissions by . The blueprint to make Britain green lays bare how averting climate disaster will have a profound impact on everyoneaposs lives. From the car you drive to the house you live in, the next decade will be one of sweeping change. So exactly how will it affect you  And what might it all cost  Here is what we know.  Electric cars are expensive - and youaposll need to buy oneThe Government has pledged to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by .While there will be no requirement for you to scrap your old car, an electric car currently costs between £, and £,.How much help,any, people will have from the Government to upgrade is not yet clear.  Ministers recognise that most lower-income households donapost buy brand new cars. The Treasury cannot predict what the second-hand electric car market will look like, however, given that it is a new market. So it could mean lower-income motorists end up saddled with loans in order to replace their petrol or diesel car. Or not having a car at all. Your mortgage could cost more Ministers are weighing up plans to link mortgages to green home improvements by imposing targets for lenders. The radical reform of the housing market would aim to nudge people to fork out to decarbonise older homes. But the drive could pile costs onto poorer families who may struggle to afford the necessary upgrades to get a cheaper mortgage.  It could mean people struggle to sell older less energy efficient homes, such as massive town houses or large family homes. Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, also said that while lower energy bills may offset some people’s costs, some houses will cost more to upgrade. Extra charges for single-use items - not just plastic Remember when the p charge for carrier bags was introduced  Well, now similar charges could be brought in for all sorts of items you use once as part of a government crackdown on throwaway culture. That will include a whole host of things, from coffee stirrers and straws to cardboard cups. It is hoped the charges will nudge consumers to use more sustainable items, after the plastic carrier bag charge cut sales in main supermarkets by %. Taxes will go up Exactly which taxes will go up and when remains unknown, but that they will is a dead cert. The Treasury document accompanying the Governmentaposs net zero plan spells out as in black and white. “Overall, a combination of tax, regulation, spending and other facilitative levers will be required, it says. For one thing, the move away from fossil fuels will blow a £bn hole in the UK budget due to the loss of the fuel duty and the vehicle excise duty and, as yet, the Treasury has not seen out how it will make up the shortfall. Buy a new boiler The net zero plan says gas boilers in new homes will be banned from  and that by  all homes should be heated with a low-carbon alternative to polluting gas. This will mean, in most cases, people switching to heat pumps and Government grants of £,. While ministers are not forcing people to ditch their gas boilers yet, they are switching levies on energy bills from electricity supplies on to gas, meaningyou rely largely on gas your bill will go up .

She has covered two general elections, the Brexit referendum and the pandemic.Sopel, , is tipped to be replaced in Washington DC by Sarah Smith, , the current BBC Scotland editor, meaning that position would become vacant.The role of leading the coverage of Scotland is seen as important following criticism from the SNP government.

One insider said: “Jon’s decision toto the UK is being seen as a catalyst for a chain of events because he’s a big hitter and needs a big role.  “Any move by Laura would have to be her decision – she’s done a brilliant job as political editor, but it’s not one that people want to do forever. “Nothing is going to happen in the very short term but next year is likely to bring some changes.” Another potential vacancy is main anchor of BBC News at Ten after Huw Edwards suggested he might be ready to quit.

They sat the local sewage network is too weak to handle torrential downpours, with high water levels creating pressure in the pipes causing the contents to spurt out, Surrey Live reports.The couple awoke on October  to find faeces covering their garden and patio. But they claim Thames Water didnapost clear up the mess until October .Following Thursdayaposs heavy rainfall, which sparked a Met Office amber weather warning, it happened again. Mr Smith, , told SurreyLive: When it rains, more water comes into the system and itaposs unable to cope. Thereaposs a backflow and pressure, and the sewage comes out into our garden. The sewage [was] still sitting there in my garden and on my patio [more than a week after the October  incident]. The odour is obnoxious and you can visibly see that itaposs sewage. Someone needs to take notice. It really has been going on for a long, long time and I can assure you that it will never get better. Itaposs only going to get worse, especially with all of these new buildings - industrial and domestic - being built in the area. The -year-old says he has been sending messages to Thames Water since  but nothing has solved the problem. Endless CCTV surveys have been carried out to look at the pipework, he said, adding that the water company have taken hundreds of photos.  Heaposs also appealed to local MP Angela Richardson, but received no response. Thames Water mentioned installing a part to the pipes, which will prevent waste overflowing into his garden, but he says they are yet to install it. A water level sensor installed around five or six years back helped on some occasions, but was not nearly effective enough, he said. Mr Smith said no solution has been proposed beyond that, but he will keep pushing until something is done to permanently fix it. He continued: If there is no further improvement in the Thames Water sewage system, itaposs only going to get worse. Money is the only thing that is going to solve it. He added: Itaposs a health hazard and [the sewage was] there for days - itaposs unfortunate. A Thames Water spokesperson said: Sewage flooding is horrible, and we sympathise with the couple for the long-running issues theyaposve experienced. The sewer network in the area is a combined system, meaning the pipes take foul water from loos, showers and washing machines, as well as rainwater. Climate change and population growth are putting increasing pressure on this local network. The area also suffers from high groundwater – this is where water in the soil can get into the network where two sections of pipe meet. As a result, the sewers can become overwhelmed, particularly during periods of intense rainfall, forcing diluted wastewater to come up through manholes. Blockages can be to blame for flooding, but Thames Water said it has carried out extensive investigations at the coupleaposs home and these have not shown any problems. The company said it visited the property on two occasions this month and found their pipe was clear and running normally. However, further CCTV investigations inside the pipe will be conducted. The spokesperson added: We will also discuss with them about fitting a apossewer depth monitorapos which will automatically alert us when the water level inside the pipe gets above a certain level. Thames Water said the coupleaposs case has been added to its Sewer Flooding History Database, which holds all reported flooding incidents within the Thames Water region. The database aims to categorise the reports by their cause, date and extent.

The court was shown graphics representing a childaposs head which displayed the bruising to Arthur. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin asked whether injuries to Arthuraposs jaw-line are typical of a six-year-old boy. Not normally, replied Dr Lyall.

This took a huge toll on himself and his family, and Sordell believes lack of enforcement means racists have become more brazen knowing the risk of punishment is low. He said this could lead to a tragedyit is not addressed, stating: We shouldnapost have to wait until it happens until we act. In just two years the number of allegations of social media racism to  police forces in England and Wales soared by  per cent, with , in  alone. Figures released by  forces - the Met, Northumbria, Staffordshire, Surrey, Humberside Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire and Cleveland - show they had only charged  people between  and  despite receiving more than , complaints.  Sordell, now , said: Itaposs pretty clear to see that people can make whatever comments they want because they know that the likelihood of them being a found and b charged are very rare.If you think about the number of cases where people have faced consequences, you could probably Google them and name them all, which is pretty telling considering how much abuse is sent. In August the former Watford, Burnley and Bolton striker told a select committee of MPs that dealing with racism directed at players is not being treated as a priority.Iaposve been racially abused, Iaposve had death threats, Iaposve had threats of dferent kinds, he told The Mirror. At times it can be easier to deal with than others. One of the things that gets forgotten is that we all have families and friends who are on social media and they see it as well. Having to navigate that isnapost necessarily always taken into account. People see finances as a protection against reality, but itaposs not, reality is reality.  He echoed a warning by former England star Anton Ferdinand, who warned that abuse could lead to a player taking their own le. People donapost take into account how traumatic being on the end of any kind of abuse, particularly racist abuse, is - itaposs not something that should be taken lightly, Sordell said. When you say someone might take their own le, some might say itaposs not that serious, but thataposs always the case. We shouldnapost have to wait until it happens until we act.The former Premier League star, who now runs a production company and works as a public speaker and writer, has done a lot of advocacy work around mental health, having struggled with depression for many years.He said that educating offenders should be a key element of tackling online abuse.  Racism has been in football for as long as Iaposve known, and as long as the previous generation have known, but itaposs found a new medium, he said. We talk about kicking racism out, but all weaposve done is moved it to a dferent place. Sordell believes social networks need to step up and work with authorities to ensure those who post racist and abusive messages are punished. The fact is that every social media company has the IP address even without having the data on the iniduals they know where they are, he said. They have that capability. Nevertheless the former striker said he would receive hateful messages from accounts with peopleaposs real names on them.  Itaposs an alarm bell of where we are, he stated. It shows people feel like itaposs fine to do so, they donapost feel like theyaposre going to be punished. He believes every social network should very those who set up an account, eventheir real name is not visible on their profile. Sordell said: If I reported them to the police, the police should be able to find out who they are. The issue isnapost me being able to see their name, itaposs about them being held to account. Social media companies have faced mounting calls to act in recent months, with football clubs staging a boycott earlier this year and widespread condemnation of racism directed at Three Lions stars Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka following the Euro  final. But Sordell said it is far too early to tellthis will cause a lasting impact.  Earlier this year fellow former Premier League star Anton Ferdinand told a Parliamentary select committee: My worry is what are the social media companies waiting for  Are they waiting for a high-profile footballer to kill themselves, or a member of their family to commit suicide. Is that what they are waiting for  Becausethat is what they are waiting for, that is too late. Letaposs deal with the issue now. The -year-old added that companies should use technology to identy inappropriate tweets before they are sent out, and talked about the need for an account owneraposs identity to be known, at least to the companies themselves. They donapost want to implement technology becauseI retweet a racist tweet that has been put my way, the frenzy around it is monetary to them, he said.The Mirror sent a list of questions to Facebook, asking for a breakdown of the number of racism complaints it had received, and the number of times it had provided details to police.The network says it is being proactive, removing more than  million pieces of hate speech content,  per cent before they were reported, and says incidents have falling slightly in the first three months of the year. It says it responds to valid legal requests for information from police, and is working with police chiefs to improve co-operation. A spokesperson said: “No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don’t want it on Facebook or Instagram. We share the goal of holding people who share this content to account and we do this by taking action on content and accounts that break our rules and working with the police.We respond to valid legal requests for information as quickly as possible, and are confident that the information we provide is helpful to police investigations. We also encourage people to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we’re committed to keeping our community safe from abuse.”A Twitter spokesperson said the company aposdoes not tolerate abuse or harassment of people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, caste, disability or diseaseapos.The social media giant says it removes content that violates itaposs rules, which includes aposdehumanising languageapos, aposhateful imagery and emojisapos. Twitter has rules in place to address threats of violence, abuse and harassment and stressed it takes action when it finds accounts that violate them.

The -year-old from Hull, went out for a bite to eat with her husband before ending up in an ambulance after her drink was allegedly tampered with.The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Hull Live she fell straight down after leaving her local pub and suffered several episodes of hallucination.Now, a few months after the despicable experience, she wants to warn women that spiking is not exclusive to young people. Speaking out to warn others, she said she had planned a fun and much-awaited evening with her partner at a local restaurant before going to see a live band. I had only had a glass of wine in a trusted local restaurant. But I’ll never be able to order a glass of wine at a bar again, she said. We left a pub and as I got up and fell straight down and apparently hit my head hard, my husband was helped to get me up, we left and I fell again as we got outside. I vomited several times, and passed out too.  I then became psychotic. I didn’t know who my husband was. I was screaming at something in the room. I fought my poor husband who was only trying to help me. I only have snapshots of a few seconds at a time but the rest is a blank. An ambulance came to me and after a while we set off to the hospital. I could have died that night, I thank god I had my husband to look after me. Her husband rang an ambulance and her unstable condition meant it took a while to get her into the vehicle. She then had another another hallucination in the ambulance and had to stay in hospital overnight. She said the hospital believed Ketamine was in her drink and requested to view the CCTV from the bar following the -year-oldaposs fall, which caused her to become concussed. Now, the self-confessed shy grandma who said her behaviour that night was so far from normal, wants people of her generation to be aware when going out, whether with friends, family, or on dates. She added: I wanted my friends especially women of my generation to be aware. It’s really not the poor young girls. Itaposs anyone available to spike and they’ll do it. It’s beyond despicable. We all associate young people being spiked as hideous as that is. Never did I think that night out would end up as it did. It’s a disgusting thing to do to anyone.

Adrian said there had been ambiguity in his correspondence with Sykes and when he previously asked what was happening with a refund, he was told they would not be getting one.

Adrian and Jane Smith, from Doncaster, paid £, for their dream honeymoon to Spain, and wanted to take son Brandon with them.As he is unvaccinated, Brandon needed a negative PCR test, so Adrian and Jane paid for the private test provider suggested by Tui themselves. But when they arrived at Doncaster Airport the family were told they were not allowed to board the plane - all because Brandonaposs test was invalid, ITV News reports. The rules of the test stated that the test had to be taken  hours before the departure time of the plane - but this was incorrect. Have you experienced anything similar trying to travel  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorIt was actually the time of arrival in Spain that mattered, meaning the test was just  minutes out of date for their landing.Adrian said: There were two very clear statements, one of them said step two take the test and it says up to  hours before the departure of the plane take the sample and register the sample.So it was very clear that it said departure of the plane not the arrival time in Spain, unfortunately that turned out to be incorrect information. So for being outside the  day time limit by around  minutes, the couple were forced tohome and abandon their trip.In a statement TUI told ITV:Weaposre very sorry the Smith family were unable to travel on their honeymoon due to the information on our testing partners website, and understand how disappointing this must have been. We have refunded their holiday, all testing costs, and are offering an additional voucher towards their next holiday as an apology for the upset caused.Jane said the pair were: Devastated, absolutely gutted, shocked. We have lost our honeymoon. We can never rewind the clock and go back to that time now unfortunately.Tui have claimed the staff were supportive and did all they could to help while they simply stood there and watched us stranded in the airport itaposs just disgusting really.

Of those who did, half said nothing happened as a result. AET head Helena Conibear called for bars and clubs to search people at the door and to have testing kits available on site. Ms Conibear added: “Our poll revealed % of drinks were spiked at private parties, % in nightclubs, % in bars and % at festivals. This can happen to anyone, anywhere and to any drink. Have you been affected by this story  Get in touch at webnews@mirror“It really is an epidemic.” She said most spiking cases did not lead to assault or robbery.Demanding action, students plan a clubs boycott on Wednesday. Police report  cases of drink spiking in September October, and  of injection. Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked the police to assess the problem.Two men have been detained in Nottingham and one in Lincoln by police investigating spiking attacks.  The two men in Nottingham - aged  and  - were detained on Friday morning on ‘suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve’. The arrests were made after officers studied CCTV footage working closely with venues in the city, police said. Superintendent Kathryn Craner, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: “These two arrests come after a plea from myself and the force for people to come forward and report any incidents to us.  “We have now arrested two men this morningon suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison and both are still in custody as our enquiries continue. “I would like to reiterate that these arrests have not been made in connection with a specic case or incident reported to us over the last few weeks of both drink spiking and spiking by a needle.” But Nottinghamshire Police did confirm they had received three new reports in the last  hours of being “spiked with a needle” - taking the total of such incidents under investigation to .The NHS website provides some guidelines on what to doyour skin has been punctured with a used needle. They advise to aposwash the wound using running water and plenty of soapapos, aposdry the wound and cover it with a waterproof plaster or dressingapos and to not scrub the wound or suck any blood. Nottingham Policeaposs websites has some guidance on what to doyour drink has been spiked, but they currently do not have any guidelines on being injected. They advise to: Tell the people you’re with and make sure you’re someone where you feel safe. Alert a member of staff at the pub or club you are at. If you feel unwell you should seek medical attention immediately and tell them that you believe your drink has been spiked. They said a number of the victims reported being spiked by some sort of injection and have reported effects “consistent with a substance being administered”. University of Nottingham student, Sarah Buckle, has told how she woke up in hospital with no memory of how she got there and throbbing pain in her hand. The -year-old later discovered she had been possibly spiked with a needle to the back of her hand while at a nightclub. Fourteen women and one man have reported to police they believe they had been spiked with a sharp object in the region. Earlier this week Nottinghamshire police arrested a -year-old man who has been released on bail as enquiries continue into spiking by needle continue. The force said they would be deploying more officers into Nottingham city centre, with a police dog operation planned for Saturday night and plain-clothes officers on duty. Lincolnshire Police said a -year-old man was detained “on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to administer them” at about am on Friday. The arrest came after what the force called “swt and proactive work in partnership from the staff at a Lincoln nightclub”, although they did not name the venue. The suspected offence “doesn’t involve a needle”, police said. Lincolnshire’s police and crime commissioner Marc Jones said: “We cannot accept people being unsafe when they go out with friends for a drink. “This arrest should send a huge signal to those would-be criminals who look to prey on our community in this despicable way.” Devon and Cornwall Police said they were investigating reports of a woman being attacked with a needle in Fever  Boutique in Exeter on Saturday, October th. The spate of reported incidents prompted Home Secretary Priti Patel to ask police forces to assess the scale of the problem. A petition launched last week to make it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search people on entry has now gained more than , signatures. Police have said there have been around  confirmed reports across September and October of drink spiking and  reports of some form of injection. National Police Chiefsapos Council lead for drugs, Deputy Chief Constable Jason Harwin, said: There are both male and female victims, though the majority have been young women. Alleged offences have taken place at licensed premises and private parties. He added: Clearly these reports are very concerning. We are working at pace with forces, law enforcement agencies such as the NCA and other partners including the Home Office and universities to understand the scale of offending, establish any links between the allegations and ultimately bring any identied offenders to justice. Ahead of the weekend, and looking further to the Halloween weekend, please be assured that forces are working closer than ever before with pubs and clubs to help tackle the issue and encouraging premises to increase searches at entry points to the venues. Police are also working with venues to make sure all staff are alert to the issue and to advise them of what to dothey see signs of spiking. We would encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim or witness to spiking, in any form, to contact their local police force. Any reports of spiking will be investigated and taken seriously.

He couldn’t stand all the brouhaha that went with updates about his health and rightly found it “bloody intrusive”. Eventually, he felt he has done his bit as the Queen’s consort and duly retired. As monarch and head of state, Queen Elizabeth II doesn’t really have that option. Her schedule has been tailored to take her great age into consideration. But nobody can account for daily changes in an elderly person’s physical health. One day they can feel great, the next dreadful.Since emerging from lockdown and the death of her husband, the Queen has thrown herself into work and had a busy schedule.This month since ing from her annual summer break in Balmoral, she seems to have been a constant presence in our newspapers and online. We should not, therefore, be hugely surprised by the advice from her medical household that she should rest up for a few days.Nor that she spent last night in hospital while apospreliminary checksapos took place – her doctors have not gone into detail. Buckingham Palace was forced to make a public statement when a planned two-day trip – to mark the centenary of partition in Northern Ireland – was cancelled.The previous night the Queen attended a reception at Windsor Castle and looked sprightly and certainly not sickly. Buckingham Palace also released video of her virtual audience with the new Governor-General of New Zealand. But her hospitalisation followed a very busy period – a speech at the opening of the Welsh Parliament and a service at Westminster Abbey marking the work of the Royal British Legion.At the Abbey she was pictured using a cane for the first time. The Palace said she was using it for her “comfort”.This coupled with the fact that she has given up her favourite alcohol tipple – a strong early evening Martini – on doctors’ advice, has got some very commentators worried. But London Bridge is NOT falling down and Her Majesty is in fine fettle, I am told.She is determined to host world leaders at COP in Glasgow at the end of the month.But these wobbles are an important reminder that despite saying “you’re as young as you feel”, Her Majesty is as old as her  years.She is a robust lady, a dedicated lady, and a brilliant wise head of state. She must, therefore, recognise, as her late husband did, that she is only human and she must pace herself going forward - for all our sakes.

The -year-old monarch was admitted to King Edward VII hospital in London on Wednesday afternoon and stayed overnight for tests. The Palace told journalists the Queen had been advised to rest and remained at Windsor Castle, but more than  hours later confirmed she had been taken to the private hospital.  A trip to Northern Ireland was cancelled at the last minute. The royal standard continued to fly at the castle after the Queen had left.A royal source denied it remained flying as part of a cover-up, telling the Daily Mail the standard did not move to every building the Queen visited.Despite the hospital stay, the source said, Windsor had remained the Queen’s residence. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said journalists and Brits aposweren’t given the complete pictureapos. He added: The problem, it seems to me, is that rumour and misinformation always thrive in the absence of proper, accurate and trustworthy information. Royal commentator and former BBC journalist Peter Hunt alleged there had been a ‘failed attempt’ to cover up the Queenaposs hospital stay. He said: The media’s faith in the veracity of royal communications will have been sorely tested by the failed attempt to hide the fact the Queen spent a night in hospital. Buckingham Palace can ill afford a breakdown in trust, given all they’re dealing with. A spokesman for the Palace declined to comment on the cover-up claims.  Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said the issue of revealing details about the monarch’s health is problematic: “This is a tricky one because the Queen does have a right to a certain degree of privacy, but on the other hand she’s head of state. “So does that entitle us to know exactly what ailments she may or may not have  It’s a very dficult one to get the balance right for the satisfaction of everybody.” Royal author Penny Junor said the Palace’s decision not to announce the hospital visit prevented unfounded rumours circulating. She said: “I’m not surprised they did that, otherwise there would be speculation. People would be putting her in her grave long before she’s ready for it.” It is understood the Queen was due to stay in hospital for only a short period while seen by specialists, so the development was not announced by the Palace at the time, and protecting her medical privacy was also a consideration. The overnight admittance was for “practical reasons”, a source said. It is said the Queen was back at her desk and doing light duties after ing to Windsor. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said late on Thursday night: “Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, ing to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today, and remains in good spirits.”Sources told Russell Myers, the Mirroraposs Royal Editor, that she was expected to have visitors, including family, this weekend, but engagements in next weekaposs diary have been put on hold.It was unclear whether she would attend the COP climate summit in Glasgow. The Queen’s admittance was her first overnight stay in hospital since she spent a night at the private clinic in  when she was treated for the symptoms of gastroenteritis.

Buckingham Palace said medics took an “understandably cautious approach”, adding the Queen’s admission was for “practical reasons”, before she ed home to Windsor Castle on Thursday afternoon. A Palace source said the results of the initial tests “could result in the need for further examinations….or confirm that no further tests are necessary”. Get the Mirroraposs daily newsletter for all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up The source added: “Clearly the doctors are looking at something during their preliminary investigations.” The Queen is understood to be committed to attending COP conference in Glasgow on November , alongside son Prince Charles and grandson Prince William, as they jointly encourage world leaders to take action on the global climate emergency.But it emerged on Friday that the Queen will only take on “light duties”, until she speaks to doctors.A palace source said: “The Queen is in good spirits and will continue to take a period of rest over the next few days.  “She will be guided by her doctors on what is appropriate in terms of her duties.” Her Majesty is understood to have several engagements in her diary for next week which have been put on hold, while an assessment on her attendance at COP will be taken in due course, The Mirror understands.Downing Street declined to say whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson held his weekly audience with the monarch on Wednesday, but so far it has not been listed in the Court Circular, the official record of royal engagements. The spokesman said: “The Prime Minister’s best wishes have been passed on to Her Majesty.” Sources confirmed the Queen is accommodating visitors over the weekend from “family who live nearby”. Her youngest son Edward, his we Sophie and their children Louise and James live in Bagshot Park in Surrey, which is just  miles away. Scandal-hit Prince Andrew, who also lives close to the Queen at his Royal Lodge home on the Windsor Estate, is also understood to be planning to visit his mother in the coming days.  The Queen was forced to “reluctantly” cancel a two day trip to Northern Ireland on Wednesday morning, less than five hours before she was due to arrive. Alongside the announcement that the Queen would not travel, Buckingham Palace said she would “rest for the next few days” at Windsor Castle. In the early afternoon the monarch was seen walking her dogs on the Windsor Estate, while it later emerged she was taken to hospital in London by car later in the day. Courtiers insisted Her Majesty was forced to stay overnight after it became too late to make the  mile journey home to Windsor. But the Palace only confirmed the Queen’s stay at pm on Thursday, more than five hours after she had ed to Windsor Castle. The Queen’s admittance was her first overnight stay in hospital since she spent a night at the private clinic in  when she was treated for the symptoms of gastroenteritis. A palace spokesman did not reveal the nature of the Queen’s investigations, but stressed the tests were “not Covid-related”. The Queen is double-vaccinated and is understood to have had her booster jab. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said the issue of revealing details about the monarch’s health is problematic: “This is a tricky one because the Queen does have a right to a certain degree of privacy, but on the other hand she’s head of state. “So does that entitle us to know exactly what ailments she may or may not have  “It’s a very dficult one to get the balance right for the satisfaction of everybody.” Comment MORE ON QueenRoyal FamilyThe QueenBoris JohnsonPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceHospitalsClimate changePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old monarch reportedly turned down the award “politely but firmly” that she was offered by Oldie magazine and instead replied with her “warmest best wishes”. Author Gyles Brandreth, chairman of the awards, wrote to the monarch askingshe would accept the title. Her assistant private secretary Tom Laing-Baker wrote back: “Her majesty believes you are as old as you feel, as such The Queen does not believe she meets the relevant criteria to be able to accept, and hopes you will find a more worthy recipient.” The rejection came just days before a health scare that saw the long-serving royal cancel an overseas trip.Now royal biographer Angela Levin said that the line “you are only as old as you feel” is an indication that she is not planning to step down. She tweeted: “I think that the Queenaposs comment that you are as old as you feel is also a nudge to let us all know she is not going to step down as Monarch.” In an earlier post she said the Queen was “absolutely spot on” with her reply to being offered the award. It comes as the Queen cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland this week after she “reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days,” said Buckingham Palace. But reports from royal circles have said that she is prioritising being ready to attend the COP climate change conference in Glasgow later this month. Brandreth, who was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall for The Oldie’s ceremony at The Savoy hotel in London last Tuesday, said the reply from the Queen was “lovely”.  He added: “Perhaps in the future we will sound out Her Majesty once more.”Camilla, , spoke at the awards ceremony and joked about ageing, according to the Express.She said: I think those of us who have already passed our three score years and ten have to acknowledge that there are certain disadvantages to growing older. Adding: There are times, I know, when we all experience those senior moments.” Buckingham Palace has faced growing criticism for keeping the hospital stay a secret, with a scathing attack launched by a BBC royal correspondent who questioned how much the Palace could be trusted.

Angela Levin, a royal biographer, has said Prince Philip, who died at the age of  back in April, would have taken the reigns and exercised a “bit of control”. Ms Levin said the Duke of Edinburgh would likely have said “Look, stop it, donapost go to so many engagements and relax a bit.” Get the Mirroraposs daily newsletter for all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up  Speaking of the news that the -year-old monarch underwent “preliminary investigations” after cancellinga planned trip to Northern Ireland this week , Ms Levin said the Queen was facing a “fight between her head and her body”. She also suspected there was a religious aspect to this struggle, after the Queen vowed at her Coronation in  that God would help her fulfil her role as the head of state until she died. News of the unexpected hospital stay was announced by Buckingham Palace last night, less than  hours after it emerged that she would no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland. A Palace spokesperson said: “Following medical advice to rest for a few days, The Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, ing to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today, and remains in good spirits.” It followed a statement from the palace about the cancelled trip, on which a spokesperson said: “The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days”. “Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland. “The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future.” According to reports from The Sun, it is understood that the Wednesday afternoon trip to private King Edward VII’s Hospital in London on was expected to be for some “preliminary investigations”. The overnight stay was reportedly for practical purposes. Speaking to talkRadio today, Ms Levin suggested it would be bestthe Queen was encouraged to take a step backwards, or sideways, in order to allow her body to recover from the many engagements she undertakes.  “I think itaposs a fight between her head and her body, because she wants to do it, she feels she can, sheaposs very articulate, sheaposs absolutely spot on with everything she says, but her body is  years old,” Ms Levin said. “I think she thinks she does it best [compared to other royals] and sheaposs the most experienced, but I think the main thing is the religious one, that when she was  and she said that she would do her best to be the Queen and with Godaposs help she would do it until she died.” Ms Levin suggested breaking this promise would make the Queen feel “very bad” as she is devout. “However, the Pope has stepped back, he retired for the first time [Benedict XVI in ] - and popes are not supposed to leave their job until they die too, and I think you have to take into consideration that people live much longer than they did in  [when she married Prince Philip].” On reports that the Queen had given up alcohol, Ms Levin thought there could be an emotional connection. The Monarch used to share a Dubonnet with ious mixtures with her husband, she said, which was a part of their relationship. Ms Levin suggested the drink “no longer has the same taste” because Philip wasn’t around anymore to pour it. According to a statement from the Palace, the Queen is now in “good spirits” and now recovering at Windsor Castle - where she has spent most of the last  months due to thecoronaviruspandemic.She is expected to spend the rest of the week recovering. It is the first time she has stayed in hospital overnight for eight years. Courtiers believe the cancellation of the Queenaposs trip will serve as a reminder that the head of state - at the age of  - cannot do what was expected of her  or  years ago. In recent weeks she has for the first time been seen walking with a stick at public engagements.The Queen remains committed to attending theCOP climate change summitin Glasgow on November , courtiers said.Her Majesty has had a jam packed schedule of engagements since ing from her summer break at Balmoral. She took on at least  engagements since the start of the month, visiting Scotland and Wales for the official opening of the Parliaments. It is understood that courtiers are keeping a close eye on the Queen’s diary moving forward so that she has the correct amount of time to recuperate from her schedule.It emerged this week that the Queenturned down the ‘Oldie of the Year’ trophybecause she feels she does not meet the criteria, believing you are only as old as you feel.A royal source said: “Her Majesty doesn’t know any other pace than full on and used to being incredibly busy, especially of late, but perhaps it is in her best interests that she takes this time to rest and recuperate before she starts once again.” Sources said the Queen will no doubt have to take on board the advice of her doctors as she battles against wanting to “do things full on” after being released from coronavirus restrictions.

The -year-old was taken to hospital on Wednesday where specialist doctors performed a series of tests at the King Edward VII hospital in Marylebone, London.She spent the night there in what was only her fth hospital visit in the past  years, before ing home to Windsor Castle on Thursday. The visit came just six months after the death of her husband Prince Philip at the age of .The Queen was forced to “reluctantly” cancel a two day trip to Northern Ireland on Wednesday morning, less than five hours before she was due to arrive.Her Majesty, who has had a jam packed schedule of engagements since ing from her summer break at Balmoral, took covid test which confirmed she was not suffering from coronavirus. Buckingham Palace sources have said the Queen remains in good spirits and will only undertake light duties before the results of the tests are clear and she speaks to doctors. It is understood other senior royals will be stepping in to fulfil her duties as she recuperates from her hospital stay. Prince Charles, , is said to be increasing his time at Windsor Castle and spent the night there on Tuesday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are also rumoured to be taking over some of the monarchaposs duties, although Buckingham Palace has shot down rumours the pair will move to Windsor as “speculation”.  Princess Anne, , who lives at Gatcombe Park, around an hour and a half away from Windsor, stepped in for her mother while she was in hospital to hand out awards - including a Damehood to food writer and TV presenter Mary Berry. Sources confirmed the Queen is accommodating visitors over the weekend from “family who live nearby”. Her youngest son Edward, his we Sophie and their children Louise and James live in Bagshot Park in Surrey, which is just  miles away. Scandal-hit Prince Andrew, who also lives close to the Queen at his Royal Lodge home on the Windsor Estate, is also understood to be planning to visit his mother in the coming days.

The Queen is understood to be committed to attending COP conference in Glasgow on November , alongside son Prince Charles and grandson Prince William, as they jointly encourage world leaders to take action on the global climate emergency.A palace source said: “The Queen is in good spirits and will continue to take a period of rest over the next few days. “She will be guided by her doctors on what is appropriate in terms of her duties.”  Her Majesty is understood to have several engagements in her diary for next week which have been put on hold, while an assessment on her attendance at COP will be taken in due course, The Mirror understands.Downing Street declined to say whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson held his weekly audience with the monarch on Wednesday, but so far it has not been listed in the Court Circular, the official record of royal engagements.The spokesman said: “The Prime Minister’s best wishes have been passed on to Her Majesty.” Comment MORE ON Royal FamilyThe Queen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tia Meggett, , escaped isolation at The Gainsborough Academy on October  with three other girls.They managed to leave the unit through a fire exit and jump a fence, but Tia caught her right-hand ring finger as she did, LincolnshireLive reports. Once she made it to the other side, Tiaaposs friends says she was bleeding and when she looked down she saw her finger missing. The school says it is now reviewing its procedures in light of the horrying incident. Mum Nicola Kelly said: It was at about am that this happened and the school rang me at around .am. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter They said that something had happened to Tia but that she would only need a few stitches. So my neighbour took me down to the school straight away and when I got there, Tia was in the back of a teacheraposs car with her hand in the air. The headteacher was there and they just passed me a bowl that had bags of frozen sweetcorn in it and when I lted the bags up, Tiaaposs finger was there. I donapost know whether what they told me on the phone was just so I didnapost panic or what, but it was quite obviously going to be more than a few stitches. The school said they called an ambulance but they said the wait would take too long. Nicola then accompanied the teachers who drove Tia to Lincoln County Hospital. Tia was eventually transferred to the Royal Derby Hospital she underwent an operation to have her finger amputated on October . Nicola added: When I first saw her at the school she was just in a complete state of shock I think. Sheaposs doing as well as she can do now in the circumstances, but Iaposm not going to be sending her back to the school. Thereaposs a video that has been going around of when she jumped the fence and there have been some nasty comments that she just doesnapost need. So the school have loaned her a laptop and Iaposm going to seeI can work out some sort of arrangement with them for her to be taught at home. My main issue is how she and the other girls managed to get out of the school, and what this teacher in their classroom was actually doingthey managed to get out of the fire exit. Iaposm not happy with them at all and I think there are so many ways that they could have handled this better and more sensitively. Tiaaposs now having to adapt to not having one of her fingers and she was a teenager girl who liked painting her nails and everything - so this is really upsetting. Martin Smith, the assistant director for education at Lincolnshire County Council, said: The academy has informed us of the incident, which we realise has been upsetting for the family. We understand that the academy is investigating the circumstances behind the incident and reviewing its procedures. A spokesperson for the council said that the school would have to provide any further information, but that they were not surethey would do so whilst their investigation was still live.

Despite it long being clear a booster jab programme would be needed, the UK government and scientic advisors were slow off the mark. Israel began their own booster programme in August, offering it to children as young as , but it took the UK almost three more weeks to begin their own. Data shows the jab offers massively improved protection against the virus and yet the booster has not been met with the same enthusiasm as the initial rollout.With winter approaching it is even more important than ever that everyone who is eligible gets their booster jab. The Mirror has taken a look at what’s going wrong with the UK’s booster jab rollout.  Why do we need boosters  Covid vaccines offer an impressive defence against the virus, but do not guarantee  per cent protection. You are still at risk of catching it and even though your chance of serious hospitalisation and death are dramatically reduced, you can pass it on or get Long Covid yourself. Added to that, studies show double-jab protection starts to wane from around five months after the second dose. King’s College London found that the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca jab against catching the virus fell from  per cent to  per cent at four to five months after a second dose. The third jab bolsters that protection, with some thinking they may become an annual thing, like the flu jab.To give you an idea of its effectiveness, the Pfizer booster jab offers . per cent protection against the virus. Am I eligible for it  As it stands, the booster is only available to the most at risk who have had a second dose at least six months ago.The NHS guidance says it is available to people aged over , those who live or work in care homes, frontline health workers, people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, and carers for, or people who live with, someone who is at risk.Invitations from the NHS to get your jab will be sent to you, as they did the first time around.If you are eligible but have not been contacted, you can use this portal to book on the NHS website. Due to the enforced six month delay post second jab, many have been left waiting for their booster, but there are reports this might be slashed to five months which would instantly make millions more eligible. How many people have had boosters - and how many have not attended In his press conference on Wednesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid implied many people were not getting their booster jabs despite being eligible.As of October , .million people had received their booster jabs according to the NHS website. However, according to calculations from John Roberts, from the Covid- Actuaries Response Group, there are . million people now eligible for a booster. This means there are .million people who are eligible for the booster but have not taken it yet.  It is this figure which is worrying many, ahead of what will likely be a tough winter and contrasted to what was previously a very successful vaccine rollout. Whataposs causing all the confusion  As stated, Britain began the booster jabs later than most countries and was always playing catch up. Added to that, complications of trying to reach very specic groups for their boosters alongside jabbing school children in their schools complicates roll out. Large parts of the public seem to have become complacent about covid and are less urgent in arranging and going for booster jabs than they initially were. None of this has been helped by poor communication from the government who have not pushed the booster programme as hard as they did the first vaccination programme.  That is due to change from this week, with the government rolling out a TV ad to convince people to get the jab as well as targeted ads online. The confusion was only worsened when health minister Edward Argar told Sky News that anyone who had had their second jab “six months and one week ago” should go onto the NHS website or call  to book their booster, eventhey have not had an invite. However, the website stresses only eligible people who have been contacted by the NHS can book.  Where are Boris Johnson and the vaccine minister Despite being, rightly, very vocal on the initial rollout and its success, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the government have not had much to say about the boosters until this week’s press conference, which was the first press conference in over a month.There have been efforts during the last few weeks, to move back to a ‘politics as usual’ and escape the pandemic.Boris has been on holiday in Marbella, where he was photographed painting and relaxing, despite the growing crisis at home.Nadhim Zahawi was widely seen to have led the initial jab effort as vaccine minister well during the earlier months of the pandemic. However, he has since been promoted to Education Secretary and in his stead Maggie Throup was promoted to the role of vaccines boss. Despite having been in the job for over a month now, Throup has not made a single national appearance despite issues around the booster rollout.

In September, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrecommended that everyone over  be offered a third dose of a Covid vaccine, as well as medical staff and younger adults with medical conditions.Only those who had had their second jab six months or more ago would be invited for a booster. Estimates reported where suggest that  million people would be ready for a third vaccine by mid-December. But at the current rate of roll-out, all the most at risk will not be jabbed again until the end of January. The push to encourage vaccine take-up comes as the daily number of cases reported in the UK surpassed , for the first time since mid-July. However, millions remain unsure of their eligibility for the jab and how to go about getting it. Here are some questions about boosters answered. Why is a booster needed  A booster jab will top up the immunity of those already fully inoculated against the virus. The NHS said a booster jab will help improve the protection you have from your first two doses of the vaccine, helping to give you longer-term protection against getting seriously ill from Covid-.  Does a booster make a big dference  A booster shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech has a dramatic effect, the firms claimed after a trial. A booster dose given to patients who had the initial two jabs showed a relative vaccine efficacy of .% when compared with those who did not receive a booster. Pfizer said that during the study period, there were five cases of Covid- in the booster group, and  cases in the non-boosted group.  Who is eligible  Those eligible for boosters include anyone aged  and over, people living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers. All those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and anyone aged  to  in an at-risk group for Covidwill also be eligible for a jab. Adults who share a household with vulnerable people will also be offered the booster. At what point do people receive a booster Booster doses can only be offered to people who are at least six months on from receiving their second dose of coronavirus vaccine. But there is talk of that changing  Yes. The interval between a second dose of Covid- vaccine and a booster could be cut from six months to five under plans reportedly being discussed by ministers and experts. The Government said the time interval between doses was a matter for the experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . What jab will be given as a booster  The JCVI expressed a preference for people to get the Pfizer jab as a third dose, regardless of which jab they were initially given. But it said that half doses of the Moderna jab could be used as an alternative. Some people may be offered a booster dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccinethey cannot have the Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, the NHS said. How do I book a booster appointment  The NHS says most people will be invited to book an appointment at a larger vaccination centre, pharmacy, or local NHS service such as a GP surgery. People who have not received an invitation within one week of the six month milestone can book an appointment online without an invitation.  Can I get the flu jab at the same time as the booster  Yes. The NHS says that most people who can get a Covid- booster vaccine are also eligible for the annual flu vaccine and it is safe to have them at the same time. The UKaposs flu season usually begins in September and ends in March but the NHS usually starts to feel the pressure in January. However Dr McCauley - a prominent flu scientist based at Londonaposs Francis Crick Institute - says Brits should prepare for an earlier surge in cases due to a rise in infections overseas.

The -year-old woman was a little reluctant when her younger sister asked her and her daughter to be bridesmaid and flower girl for the special day as she knew her sister would a massive bridezilla, but nevertheless she agreed.My sister has always been one of those people that has to have everything perfect to the point sometimes it was hard to be around her, the woman explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. But, since she was my little sister and I’ve got no other siblings, I always made excuses when she’d hurt me.Over the last few months during the build up to the wedding, the woman and her daughter have had to practise multiple dances, pay for very expensive dresses and put up with my sisteraposs tantrums.  I told her from the startshe was in anyway nasty to my child I wouldn’t stand for it and she assured me she’d never be nasty towards her aposfavourite person in the whole worldapos, the woman continued. Well her now husbands little cousin, who is around eight, has started coming to dance practice with her mom and my sister started to ask her do little things like show my daughter how to throw the petals. I honestly thought she’d make them both flower girls for a while but when she started to make my daughter sit out and have the little girl do her poem I knew what was gonna happen but prayed I was wrong. A few weeks before the wedding, the woman decided to invite her sister out for a coffee to ask her what was going on with her daughter and the wedding, only to be told the four-year-old wasnapost doing everything right and her sister was afraid she was going to mess up by not doing the right dance or the right movements on the day. I told her she doing a pretty good job and everyone was always praising her, but my sister giggled and said it’s not THEIR day now is it so it’s not up to US what’s good enough for her wedding. I asked her straight up did she think her niece wasn’t good enough to be in her wedding and she said not as something big as a flower girl but she should still attend.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The woman then asked her sister how she thought she should break it to her little girl that she was no longer going to be in the wedding when she was so excited, to which her sister responded: Just figure it out. A few days later, she finally plucked up the courage to tell her daughter in the kindest way possible, but she says it broke her heart and she cried herself to sleep that night. The woman told her sister she would have to think about whether any of them would be attending at all, and a week later her sister started dropping off gts and asking them to re-join the wedding party, as a number of her other bridesmaids - including some family members - had dropped out. We ended up going for a few weeks away with no phones. When we came back my sister had sent me multiple letters and emails apologising and her in-laws and husband have called me an a**hole for doing what I did, the woman added, before asking Reddit whether they thought she was in the wrong. Remind her your niece wasn’t good enough for her vision of her day so you removed the problem, one Reddit user commented. My sympathies to her future kidsthey aren’t perfect. Her husband should be horried by the monster he married. Meanwhile, another added: You got to protect you kid plain and simple. I could understandshe was having behavioural issues but kicking her out just because a four-year-old wasnapost able to do all the dances or whatever correct is crazy. A four-year-old!! Other than throwing rose petals and walking, what  is there to do  I didnapost even know that flower girls had a dance in weddings.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Comment MORE ON Wedding day\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Instead of making a fresh batch, as you may have expected, Deandre simply reheats them. He begins by throwing the cooked chips that are sat in a heating station back into a frying basket to dip them in the oil for a quick fry. He leaves it in there for a few seconds before taking them out and putting them back into the packaging.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and thousands of comments from ided viewers. One person said: How is asking for fresh fries rude  I swear people love to do the bare minimum, to which Deandre replied saying: Demanding and asking are two dferent things. Another joked: “Then you have to remake them because we all know they’re not fresh and complain, so you’re really playing yourself. A third person said reheating the fries is unsafe because the salt ruins the oil. But surprisingly, the majority of people didnapost seem to care as long as their chips were warm. Lol thataposs fine as long as theyaposre hot, one said.  Another added: Literally as long as they arenapost cold, tough or soggy [I donapost care]. If that fixes it then Iaposm cool with it. While someone  advised: Always ask for fries with no salt and they will a hundred per cent be fresh! Bring your own salt!

One mum asked for advice online on how to navigate the murky waters after falling out with her ex over child support. Her ex, who grew up in a wealthy family, provides her with a generous amount every month to support their son. But the mum, who lives frugally, chooses to save most of it, in a bid to save for her sonaposs future and teach him how to budget.Taking to Reddit, In the Am I The A****** forum, the woman asked for opinions on whether she was wrong for raising their four-year-old cheaply. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter hereShe explained: So, my ex gives me a generous amount of child support every month and I use about -% of it maybe. I’m very good at budgeting since my mum raised me on her own and we always stuck to a strict budget. My ex grew up being overindulged and knowing he would never have to worry about money in his letime, so we have dferent ideas of what living cheaply looks like. Recently, the topic of money became an issue between them - after her ex discovered she was walking their four-year-old to school every day. He initially offered to buy her a car, before demanding she takes him to school in a taxi after she refused to purchase one. She said: Again, I told him no and he brought up all of the other ways he thought I was making our son aposlive cheaplyapos. He said I didn’t buy him new football boots when he started getting into football , I buy him “cheap” clothes, I rarely take him to eat out andwe go to a toy shop, I only ever let him get one thing and it can’t be super expensive. When he asked where the money was going, the woman told him sheaposs saved it, either for a rainy day or for our son. Now he’s angry at me for making our son “live cheaply” and essentially told me to stop saving and actually give our son the things he wants now because he had already made sure our son would be fine in the future, she added. People were split, with many thinking the mum should save the money on behalf of their son - not for anything . One wrote: All that money should be used to support your son not “put away for a rainy day” put any access money in a college fund or something for his future. This is not your money, it’s for your son.Another added: Setting the money aside in case her son needs something in the future is smart. She’s not acquiring it for herself. The dad is wealthy now but things can change. Paying for an Uber home from school isn’t normal. Her son’s needs are being met and wanting to make sure that continues regardless ofher ex’s financial situation or willingness to pay changes is not acting in bad faith. Home-cooked meals instead of eating out and only buying one toy at a time doesn’t sound like they are living in squalor, wrote a third.

And with school pupils now carrying phones with them, teachers have got to be extra vigilant to spot those who might be tempted to turn to the internet for a helping hand. But one teacher has found a brilliant way to catch out their students, and the video has been watched more than one million times on TikTok. It shows a room full of pupils taking a test, with stacks of books piled on the desks to hide their answers, meaning it would be easy for anyone to sneak a glance at their phone without being seen.

Itaposs not the first time a teacher has out-smarted their pupils after another became fed up of students leaving the exam to use the toilet, knowing that they were really looking up answers. A student in the class explained that the teacher knew the website their classmates were using to cheat and put a question in the test that was illogical and impossible to solve. A month before the exam, he got a teaching assistant to pose the problem on the website, where he anonymously replied with an answer that was incorrect and very unlikely that someone would make the same assumptions and mistakes independently. From the  exams handed in,  of them fell for the trick and gave the exact answer their own teacher had posted online.

Chloe Cervone and partner Lucy Ross were nearing the end of a fortnight break to the North African holiday hotspot when the Moroccan Government axed flights to and from the UK.The flight bancame into effect at midnight , after being announced on Wednesday as it was reported that numbers in the UK have sat above , for seven days in a row.The Foreign Office has subsequently updated its Morocco travel advice to explain: The Moroccan Government has announced the suspension for an unspecied period of direct flights between Morocco and the UKwith effect from midnight  October”. As a result airlines and tour operators have been forced to cancel flights and holidays with very little notice. Chloe and Lucy had been due to jet home on Thursday night.However, according to Teesside Live reports, the new travel rules scuppered that - as well as Chloeaposs plans to sell ice creams from her business in the seaside town.We were supposed to fly out last night, but the flight was cancelled. We have been told it is going to be rescheduled for tonight, but there is still so much uncertainty, said Chloe, whoruns Flows Flavours Ice Cream.Their travel saga means they are having to sit tight inside the Hotel Riu Palace Tikida Taghazout. Located near sandy beaches, the all-inclusive is described on TripAdvisor as having the highest standards in terms of luxury, excellence and sophistication, with five bars, a steakhouse and even a patisserie. While Chloe admits it is gorgeous, they are still trying to find out when their flight to Manchester will eventually happen. We have spoken to our reps this morning, but they have told us they donapost know what is happening, she added. They will update us at PM tonight to let us knowwe can go home or not, but it seems very unlikely. aposIapos am not complaining though as it is paradise out here in an empty resort and just what the Flows Flavours Ice Cream team needed after a busy summer selling ice cream in Whitby..  However, their story serves as a stark reminder as to the potential perils of travelling during this pandemic. While British holidaymakers have flocked to tourist destinations since the rules were relaxed, the UKaposs spiralling infection rate could potentially see other countries follow Moroccoaposs lead. The country suspended all flights to Britain - as well as Germany and Holland - from : BST on Wednesday until further notice. The action comes amid fears the UKaposs infection rate is starting to once again spiral out of control. Current figures show our infection rate is around  times higher than Moroccoaposs. There are growing concerns that fresh restrictions may be needed over the winter, such as face masks, to ease pressure on the NHS.Yet while they wait to find out when they can , Chloe used her firmaposs Facebook page to send a message back home that things werenapost too bad.Posting a picture of her sun-drenched resort, she added the caption: Stuck in paradise . We were hoping to be back out this weekend serving you your favourite sweet treats, but due to these unforeseen circumstances we will have to wait and see.

To your good health.”She then bursts into a fit of giggles, as does her daughter Stephanie Harris and the two nurses who accompany them at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. The retired teacher, , reassures them “laughter is medicine for the soul” and  minutes later she passes from this world, still holding Steph’s hand.The small glass she had toasted with was the first of two drinks, it was the one to stop her being sick. The second, her last, contained a fatal dose of barbiturates. Stephanie said: “She was laughing and smiling when she took the drink, there was no hesitation. She was happy to go and in control. She wanted to be free and she was just about to be. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “Everyone with her in the room was in hysterics while she was making jokes. She loved laughter – and loved le, but she’d had enough of this one. We both hadtickets to the UK but my mum had no intention of using hers.” But Isabel did ask her daughter to record her final moments andhome to Woking, Surrey, with the tape of her last words to help the fight for a law change. Assisted dying opponents say current rules protect the vulnerable from being pressured into ending their lives, but today the House of Lords will debate a bill about it. Similar bills have been defeated in the past but it would give new rights to terminally ill adults in England and Wales. It wouldn’t have helped Isabel, who did not have a terminal diagnosis, but her family feel it is at least a start. In her last taped moments last Thursday, Isabel spoke of her wish to see things change at home, telling the Dignitas volunteers: “I think it is absolutely wonderful. I only wish that you could have more permission to do it for other people and other people could have the means to be able to do it... I think it’s very unfair.  “I was very lucky in that I managed to do lots of things, swimming, and I also travelled a great deal... “But I feel I am  now and I feel like I have had the good fortune to be so well and to have the fun that I’ve had.” Isabel did suffer from declining eyesight and Alzheimer’s but to her she was in good health. “I haven’t anything really wrong except from old age, my hands are going funny and legs are going funny and I can’t walk the same. I need help and it is just time to go. “I just wish that other people could have the wonderful help, obviously from my family but also from Dignitas because there is a time to go. “To lose your capacity and things like that, is very wrong... very sad.” Talking about losing a best friend in a home and a relative who died of dementia, she said: “To see the effect on the family, she had a very, very, good son looking after her and he didn’t know where she was. “When I saw that I thought ‘no way’... it’s very sad because you are not in control of yourself. So therefore with the relative I had, they would come home and she would be out wandering and I saw that and I never wanted to reach that stage.  “But I do want to praise Dignitas. I just wish more older people could have this opportunity.” Then Isabel and Stephanie discuss the logistics of assisted dying. They say it took them two years to get the paperwork sorted out, and have medical reports compiled, and that it all cost around £,. Stephanie explains on the tape how the process has “not been easy”. During that time they had some lovely family meals and it would have been great to have gone home and done it there. Her mum added: “It is a great shame to see how many old people there are in the world today, and not just old people, where their quality of le is not feasible for them. There ought to be help for them and there isn’t.” Isabel then asks the nurses: “Do you find more people are coming now ” The Dignitas nurse tells her: “About the same. In Autumn there are always more than in the summer time.” Stephanie plans to have Isabel’s ashes scattered in her beloved East Africa where she was once an education boss for the Commonwealth. Isabel says: “My happiest days were there. I taught Africans and I helped build schools.”  The nurse brings the final dose and asksIsabel wants to move to the bed or an electronic chair which is “great for sleeping”.  Stephanie says: “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me...” The Dignitas nurse says: “I say goodbye. Have a good trip to Africa...” Then in the one moment of total seriousness Isabel says her final words to her daughter: “Bye, thank you, bye love. I want you to be happy, it hasn’t been an easy le for you and the thought of you really enjoying yourself means a great deal to me... don’t work so hard as you do. “Enjoy, laugh and have fun...” Turning to the room she takes the last drink and says “Prost” , before adding: “That wasn’t bad!” Minutes later she takes her last breath. Talking to the Mirror after ing home alone, Stephanie said: “I’m not sad at all. I’m so glad she’s free but I just have this massive empty space inside me, I feel sick. “She was a very strong, independent woman and brave. She was brave to the end.” Comment MORE ON DignitasAssisted suicide\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

“better canned cocktails”, the team decided  to launch the business after they sold more than , cans of negroni, a popular Italian-style cocktail.The initial negroni in a can was initially devised  as a gting service to raise spirits during lockdownMr Lawrence, a multi award winning and internationally recognised bartender, said: “We basically just dipped our toes in the water with the initial negroni can product and were pretty surprised at how well it went.#We quickly realised that with some of the world’s best bartenders in our team, along with in-house production and design capabilities we could do something pretty unique on a much bigger scale.”The Whitebox team completed a pre-seed £, funding deal to support the establishment of a production site in Sighthill in Edinburgh where the products are mixed, blended and canned. The team was assisted in funding round by accountancy firm Johnston Carmichael.Mr Iravani and Mr Lawrence are well known for having launched Porters# Gin in .Mr Iravani said: “Wherever you are, take a look in your nearest store, you’ll see formulaic brands doing cocktails by numbers.#We are doing the opposite. Each cocktail is unique and excellent, and the passion we have for making excellent drinks comes through in every detail.“With Whitebox we’re not going to take the traditional approach of branded line extensions. We’re just going to make the best possible canned negroni.#If you like it, try our other drinks. It is refreshingly simple, and an enjoyable way to create our products.”Seven staff are currently based in Edinburgh and a further three in London with plans to grow the team and expand the Whitebox line, with more products due to be launched in the coming months.The idea was born out of the desire to create drinks that allowed customers to experience expertly mixed cocktails at their own convenience.Now the Whitebox team have produced classic cocktails such as martinis, old fashioneds and whisky highballs, as well as collaborations with bars from around the world, with each product featuring its own unique design and bespoke recipe.Eight premixed drinks are available in more than  UK retailers.All Whitebox products are mixed to adapt to being stored in cans and have a similar alcohol by volumepercentages to drinks served in the world#s top cocktail bars according to the team.Forecast to be the fastest growing alcohol sector over the next five years, according to the IWSR Drinks Market analysis, the ready-to-drink space is booming with retail volume sales increasing by % year on year.Stewart Pennington, deputy head of food and drink at Johnston and Carmichael, said: “Consumer behaviours have undoubtedly been influenced by lockdown and this exciting new venture for Ben and the Whitebox team is a standout offering in the current market, so it was no surprise that investors were eager to back the project.#Orchid, in Langstane Place, was closed for most of  due to Covid-. During that time the bar had to redevelop its offering to survive the pandemic and launched a postal service for its cocktails.The team at the venue sent out more than , cocktails to thousands of customers across the UK."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/SCB-231021-01-003_41162876-2v0232h9x-558x372.jpg ","title":"historic 150 year old inverurie barge pulled from mud ahead of conservation work","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remMany people would not have looked twice at the rusting skeleton of a barge that had been poking from the ground at an industrial estate near Inverurie for the last  years.But the unassuming structure # measuring around five metres by one and a half # represents something signicant enough that today it was pulled from the mud for six months of conservation work ahead of a museum exhibition.The effort this morning was the culmination of much hard work by a team at the Garioch Heritage Centre, led by project coordinator Joan Bruce.She was first alerted to the history behind the boat by fellow member Marc Falconer, who had spotted a Facebook post about it.The story centres on a canal that linked Aberdeen and Inverurie in the first half of the th Century, running through the heart of an area rich with industry.Though it lasted barely  years before being replaced by the railway, the waterway played an enormous role in expanding paper-making, granite quarrying and agriculture in central Aberdeenshire.The cast iron barge that was sticking out from the undergrowth at Kirkwood Commercial Park is believed to be the last existing boat that worked on the canal, and can be dated back at least  years.Mrs Bruce said: #I want to use the boat as a starting point for telling the story of transport, through showing the canal boat in its cleaned-up form, possibly giving it the context of a picture of the canal basin.#Because it was such an important part of enabling the agricultural industry, the granite industry and the paper industry to start developing much more, and then of course the canal route was used directly for the railway itself.#Ultimately, the barge will become the centre of an exhibition on the upper floor of the heritage centre, located in Inverurie.However, before it gets there, it had to be removed from the ground where it had been sitting since being dredged from the canal bed more than  years ago.This was the operation that took place earlier today, involving a crane and several members of the local Garioch Rugby Club.Mrs Bruce said: #There were people going down over the last couple of days assessing how they might lt it.#When I spoke toand said he needs to tell us what to do, he said, #What you need’s a rugby team of strong guys who are used to working as a team.##He was half-joking, and I said, #Are you serious # and he said, #I am actually, that would work.#She called in former Heritage Centre committee member and rugby club honorary president Jim Black to lend a hand.Mr Black said: #We thought that the rugby club might like to get involved and provide a few bodies to try and help lt it.#The guys have said there will be a number there.#A productive morning spent helping Garioch Heritage recover an old inspection barge from Port Elphinstone for restoration.Well done guys, much appreciated.Posted by Garioch Rugby onSaturday,  October He added: #The important thing is that we try and keep the boat intact so we can get it up to our museum in a good condition.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

The superb fluttering of light was of startling beauty and dazzling splendour, momentarily illuminating the sky from horizon to horizon.Accompanied by this brilliant display of lightscape were sharp cracks and outbursts of thunder, which rumbled, reverberated and re-echoed throughout the landscape with an eerie sort of foreboding effect.The phenomenon was characterised by a high percentage of fork lightning, which is most unusual in our temperate zone."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 15","story":"It was encouraging to see a positive and constructive debate, with cross-party MSPs from across the region delivering a similar message.What matters now is what happens next.John Gurr, chairman of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, has invited Transport Minister Graeme Dey and the area#s MSPs to join him in a journey along the route, #on the bus too,#desired.Whatever mode of transport Mr Dey choses to take one thing remains certain.

I have referred to this excellent record in providing information for this historical résumé.A further detailed company history is being prepared, though the rapidity with which West Coast#s evolution takes place means that it is hard to ever regard any such work as complete!Suffice it to say that John, David and William Craig, having formed a garage repair business just after the end of the First World War, then ventured into the realms of road passenger transport in February  by launching a service between Campbeltown and Tarbert to compete with Duncan Ramsay, an existing operator on this route.The Post Office then put out to tender its mail contract to meet the steamer at Tarbert. It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow. This was renewed at succeeding intervals and continued right up until .The vans and light trucks later used were every bit as smartly turned out as the coaches, and were an excellent advert for the company.To be continued in next week#s Courier."},{"url":null,"title":"whats on at campbeltown picture house","story":"Ron’s Gone Wrong is the story of Barney, a socially awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally-connected device, which is supposed to be his ‘Best Friend out of the Box.’ Ron’s hilarious mals set against the backdrop of the social media age, launch them into an action-packed journey in which boy and robot come to terms with the wonderful messiness of true friendship.Previews From ThursdayDirected by Denis Villeneuve Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded.

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

Jesus rebuked him for his unbelief and said: ‘Blessed are those who have not seen yet believe.’We believe lots of things, not because we can see them for ourselves but by accepting the word of those who have.Christians believe in Jesus, not because we have seen him with our own eyes, but because of the reliable word of the apostles who physically saw the risen Jesus with their own eyes.I encourage you to read the Gospels, the accurately written-down eyewitness testimony of the apostles to Jesus so that you might see who he is and as you trust in him alone,"},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his

Silver inlaid with  of gold, decorated with little knuckles of amber and red glass, it is a thing of beauty.ldquoThis is the best example of its kind anywhere in Britain or Ireland, Maldonado says. ldquoIt would have been worn by someone of the top level. Wersquore talking kings or bishops.He points to the intricate carvings in the gold. ldquoThe closer you look the more you see. The little birdies there, the little animals. The best one is the wolf, he says, pointing to a tiny snout.Ornate patterns of animal figures curl around and across the gold. Dating to around AD, this is an example of the height of craft and art in the eighth century.So, the question is how did it end up buried in a Viking womanrsquos grave more than  years later at the end of the ninth century Adrian Maldonado examines a Viking axe headToday, Maldonado, until recently Glenmorangie Research Fellow and now the Galloway Hoard researcher, is laying out the answer. And in doing so hersquos telling us a story of the Vikings that may be a little dferent than the one we think we know.ldquoThis is buried at the end of the ninth century, he says of the brooch-pin, which was discovered by an Orkney farmer in . ldquoOne of the first generation of Viking burials in Westness.ldquoThis is a woman who is about  to  when she dies. She seems to die in childbirth because there is an infant in the grave with her. Shersquos wearing her oval brooches, Scandinavian-style, and this, one of the best examples anywhere of a brooch-pin of this kind.ldquoThe interesting thing about Westness is that itrsquos a Viking cemetery, but itrsquos in a Pictish burial ground. The Picts are already burying there. The Vikings, instead of setting up a new burial ground, just bury alongside the Picts.ldquoThe Westness woman, in particular, has this real mix of Norse stuff, Irish stuff, English stuff and this thing, he says, pointing to the brooch-pin, ldquoprominently displayed. So, shersquos wearing little belts that are probably Northumbrian, shersquos got a comb that is probably Friesian, shersquos got a beaded necklace from Germany.ldquoSo, this person is showing off all the dferent things the Viking world has access to in one burial.ldquoAnd the fact that she is wearing this means shersquos probably of Irish or Pictish descent.Three other women buried as Vikings on the site have had their bones tested and have been declared ldquoinsular, which means theyrsquore from Ireland, Scotland or northern England.ldquoTheyrsquore definitely not Norse women, Maldonado explains. ldquoAnd the men from that same cemetery tend to be from colder climates and so they are Norse.Viking brooches held in storage at the National Museums Collection CentreWhat does this all mean  It means that some of our cliched notions of the Vikings may be wrong. That the idea of the Vikings as wild warriors looting and burning and pillaging their way across Europe for a couple of centuries from the end of the eighth century is not the whole story.The true Viking saga is a more complex, fluid one than we sometimes allow. And itrsquos one that takes in Ireland, England, the Arab world and the birth of Scotland.Or, put another way, itrsquos another chapter of the human story itself a story of encounters that sometimes led to violence but also to trade, to wealth, to marriage, to the sharing of ideas and ultimately to integration or assimilation.Maldonado is a modern-day example of that story himself. Born in Puerto Rico, the -year-old studied medieval history at Hard. In his third year he came to St Andrews on an exchange programme. ldquoAnd I saw the Border abbeys, I saw St Andrews Cathedral. That was it. Medieval history was over, and I transitioned into archaeology. I came back to Glasgow for a Masters.In  he was appointed the Glenmorangie Research Fellow, a position funded by the whisky distiller, which has meant rummaging around in the storerooms of the National Museums Collection Centre in Granton where we are today.There are roughly , items on display in the National Museum of Scotland up in Chambers Street. In Granton, there are some  million more, spread around  buildings. This installation is more than just storage, though. Itrsquos a centre for conservation, preservation and scientic research.And so, Maldonado has been working his way through tray after tray of Viking artefacts since . Out of this has come a new book, Crucible of Nations, and a renewed idea of who the Vikings were and how they changed European history. And Scottish history into the bargain.Read More: What did the Romans do for us Itrsquos a story that begins at the end of the eighth century with the first Viking raid on the British Isles. A violent insertion into the story that has echoed down the centuries.Their target was monasteries. ldquoTheyrsquore like the universities of their day with all the money and wealth and resources that brings, Maldonado explainsldquoThe bishops are wearing gold rings, theyrsquore wearing silk and fine robes, and these places are quite open. At the end of the eighth century word gets to Scandinavia.In AD, the first Viking raid hits Lindisfarne in Northumbria. Two years later, Iona is targeted.The Vikings seize wealth, and they seize people. Some to sell off as slaves. Some to hold for ransom.ldquoFrom there itrsquos a couple of years of smash and grab raids, incredible violence, Maldonado continues. ldquoOn Iona,  people are killed during a raid in .ldquoItrsquos a massacre. Instead of taking people away something went wrong.ldquoBut that seems to be the exception.And this is key. For all our populist notions of Viking raids there is little actual evidence of burning churches and mass executions.ldquoIt almost never happens, Maldonado points out. ldquoThere is only one place in Scotland that has good evidence of violence and burning down.Adrian Maldonado in the NMS Collection CentreldquoPortmahomack [in Easter Ross] was the sight of a massive monastery that was completely undocumented. But an archaeological excavation has uncovered a huge burning layer.ldquoThere are a couple of skulls with blade wounds to the head. Thatrsquos the one place where it definitely seems to have taken place. Otherwise, it just doesnrsquot happen.The reality of the Viking age is more nuanced. As time passes, the Vikings begin to settle in the north and west of Scotland and along the coast of Ireland. They become part of our island story.ldquoDublin is the big one. But in Scotland they take over entire islands. Colonsay seems to go completely Viking. Thatrsquos Viking headquarters. There are loads of burials, loads of settlement evidence.ldquoSome islands like Mull seem to have no Viking settlements or Viking burials. You could read that in a couple of dferent ways. The people of Mull fought them back hellip Maybe. Or they came to an agreement.ldquoThatrsquos something that we donrsquot really talk about with the Vikings. We imagine them killing their way through. But the patterns of settlement really show you something .Thatrsquos not to say they didnrsquot fight. In The Wolf Age, his new history of the Vikings in the th century, the Norwegian historian Tore Skeie argues that to the Vikings war ldquowas a kind of natural state, a completely commonplace part of the world and peoplersquos lives.And therersquos no question they fought on Scottish soil. At the beginning of the Viking age in the ninth century there was a huge battle in AD which saw the death of both the Pictish King and the King of Dalriada at Viking hands.There would be more battles in the ninth century, but the Vikings quickly established settlements on Orkney, Shetland, the Hebrides and possibly in Strathclyde. And by the late ninth century the ision between Viking and native is beginning to rub away at the edges.What we begin to see is the Vikings settle beside the Picts and the Irish. They bring their families with them as part of the war bands, set up homes in Ireland and what would become Scotland. And they begin to intermarry. Hence the woman in the grave in Westness wearing a brooch-pin made  years and maybe more before she lived and died.A new term is invented for these Vikings who have settled in the British Isles, ldquoforeigner Gaels.The result is a flow of information and influence flowing both ways, with the waters of the North Sea and the Irish Sea as the information highways.ldquoThe Vikings bring this Irish fashion out of Ireland into Scotland. And then it goes back to Norway, and they start making their own Norse-flavour brooches and pins in that Irish style, Maldonado explains.ldquoThe colonial process goes both ways. It seems that people are moving in both directions and families are coming over here, bringing the objects that they wore in Scandinavia, and we end up seeing them in their graves.ldquoBut more often than not theyrsquore wearing Scandinavian brooches with stuff made in Dublin, stuff made here.Silver is the wealth of the time. The Vikings access Russia via the Baltic and then travel down the silk road, selling slaves in exchange for silver.ldquoTheyrsquore bringing back pure silver from the Islamic world. We know that because we have these dirham coins, Arabic coins, that are minted in Uzbekistan and found in Viking hoards in Scotland, Maldonado explains.And that wealth begins to be spread around. ldquoIf you see which way the wind is blowing, you might learn a bit of Norse to trade at least. If you donrsquot go fully Viking, you at least pick up a few words. If you give them the cattle they want, you might get a bit of silver out of it.ldquoThatrsquos the Galloway hoard in a nutshell.The hoard, which dates to AD is the richest collection of Viking-age objects found in Britain and Ireland. It was discovered at Balmaghie in Kirkcudbrightshire in .What was found may look Viking, but there are Anglo-Saxon names written on it, Maldonado points out.ldquoSo, these are locals. It just shows you that people can plug into this system once itrsquos in place.What emerges then is a picture of peoples living alongside each other in settlements, sharing craft skills and culture. Gaels beside Vikings in Ireland, Picts beside Vikings on the Scottish islands. And as time passes there is inevitably a blurring of those lines.Ideas and influences are shared, whether that be jewellery designs or Gods. By the th and th centuries Vikings were beginning to convert to Christianity or at least paying lip service to the new God in exchange for the possibility of more trade or influence.But in this push and pull of cultural influences there were inevitably losers. And in this case, it seems to have the Picts.Orkney and Shetland were Pictish once. The evidence of Pictish symbols carved in stone suggests as much. And yet there are no Pictish place names left, though some ndash Pitlochry, Aberfeldy ndash still exist on the mainland.Does that suggest the Vikings simply wiped the Picts out on the islands  ldquoItrsquos not so easy as that, Maldonado points out. ldquoThe archaeology doesnrsquot show any evidence of that wiping out. What you have is Viking objects in Pictish houses for about  years.ldquoItrsquos like they are living alongside each other, or the Vikings are taking their homes. Either way, there is not this overnight massacre. You just donrsquot see it. Theyrsquore using Pictish combs alongside Norse combs, old brooches, new brooches side by side.ldquoFor at least  years there is this overlap and then it goes a little bit more strongly Norse. And the idea is they didnrsquot have to wipe anybody out. After a while in Orkney and Shetland theyrsquore trading with Norway more than they are trading with anybody . People are right on the motorway there.ldquoIt just becomes easier to pick up Norse and have Norse be the language of business, the language of the kings. And eventually it just becomes the language that everybody speaks.The Picts were squeezed between the Viking incursions and the increasing strength and influence of the Gaels.Eventually, therersquos no more Pictish language, there are no more Pictish symbols. On the islands they speak Norse, where they start speaking Gaelic.ldquoAnd thatrsquos the beginning of Alba, suggests Maldonado. ldquoSo, the Picts disappear in the Viking age. Theyrsquore the only people that this happens to. Everybody  kind of makes their way through.And Picts apart, this, Maldonado points out, is the real story of the Viking age. Itrsquos a story of dferent peoples rubbing against each other, sometimes, often, violently, but also becoming intertwined.And that can be seen in the Viking artefacts in front of us in Granton here today.ldquoTheir shields are made in Dublin their swords are made in France and the pins are made in Ireland. And we call these things Viking, Maldonado concludes.This is the complex and interrelated truth about the Vikings. Their story is our story tooOn the tray in front of us the Westness brooch glitters still, more than , years after it was made, a shining beacon from the Dark Ages, a time more complex than we sometimes imagine.Crucible of Nations: Scotland from Viking Age to Medieval Kingdom by Adrian Maldonado, published by National Museums Scotland Enterprises, is available to pre-order now.

Infection levels, which fell sharply through September, stalled suddenly around October  and have plateaued ever since with some areas - Falkirk, East Dunbartonshire, Fe and Clackmannanshire - now seeing fairly rapid increases again.In the month after moving to Beyond Zero on August , Scotland also saw the fastest rise in infections of any part of the UK.

The same is true for Wales and Northern Ireland, whose cases have also been climbing since the beginning of this month.None of this is to say that mitigations including facemasks, homeworking, and vaccine passports dont work.Rather it tells us that unpicking the impact of ious measures in a real-world setting with so many confounding iables, especially around human behaviour, is extremely dficult.The reality is that we dont really know why Englands epidemic played out so unexpectedly, nor can we know how much worse Scotlands third wave might have been without them.Scotland has now vaccinated half of -s, compared to around % in England. But over % of -s and % of -s remain unvaccinated. Most other nations are also double vaccinating children over Vaccine passports, of course, have only just come into force. Comparing approaches and outcomes in Scotland and Wales against England and Northern Ireland, and parts of Europe - where they apply to most public spaces - would be illuminating.It is not a straight comparison though: much of the continent also benefits from lower levels of obesity, higher healthcare spending, and less chronic multi-morbidity, which has also helped to keep their Covid death rates lower relative to the UK.For now then, Boris Johnson is banking on vaccines and boostersto get England through.In Scotland, nearly, people have had their Covid booster - enough to cover all care home residents, and around % of all frontline NHS, social care workers and over-s combined.The - age group have begun receiving appointment letters.Nonetheless, organisations including Age Scotland, have expressed concern that the programme is not moving fast enough at a time when over-s - a group which is entirely fully-vaccinated - are making up % of hospital Covid admissions, up from % in mid-September.Over , have now had boosters and .% of people aged -plus are fully vaccinated.

Over the last few decades, Glasgow has built up this reputation as a centre for excellence and, with its expertise and knowhow, for being able to host some of the biggest exhibitions and conferences and sporting events. We just have to think back to the Commonwealth Games in  and to the Euros, more recently, so I think that hosting COP is a worthy reflection of that reputation. I am also very happy that it is here because, ultimately, after the past  months that we as city and society have gone through.Mr Braat believes there will be benefits to businesses and citizens at a much-needed time.He added: ldquoThere will be thousands of delegates and activists coming to the city and it will be a massive boon to the cityrsquos economy and in particular to the hospitality trade at a time when they need that injection of support. I think COP will deliver that.ldquoEven more importantly I think we have to realise that the summit and its outcome will benefit the world and it is of an existential importance to everyone, not just to this city, but to the whole planet. The result is absolutely critical so I am hoping that on November  to be reading headlines that we have the Glasgow Agreement. That is ultimately what we are aiming for ndash a in that positive, meaningful end result after two weeks of negotiations that will hopefully give us a signicant legacy and a signicant sustainable planet to take forward so that the next generations wonrsquot look back with shame on the current generation.As steps are made to get the city COP ready, the cityrsquos leadership has faced criticism in past weeks over its cleansing policy and claims of dirty streets and there was a backlash when Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken dismissed them, saying the city needed no more than a ldquospruce up ahead of COP.Read more: Clarkston falls silent in tribute to gas disaster victims  years onSpeaking yesterday, Ms Aitken said the council was focusing on dealing with fly-tipping ahead of the COP summit and acknowledged there are ldquohotspots where it is a particular problem.Ms Aitken said the pandemic has had a ldquosignicant impact on the cityrsquos cleansing services but she insisted the litter situation is improving.With road closures due to be in place, including part of the Clydeside Expressway from pm this evening, Mr Braat said he was very acutely aware of the possible disruption ndash not just in his role as Lord Provost, but also as the local councillor for the area where many of the meetings and side events linked to the summit are being staged.ldquoWe know there could well be other disruptions with regards to a potential rail strike, he added. ldquoEveryone has the right to withdraw their labour in situations where they are feeling aggrieved or want to seek financial alleviation, but I have to stress the point that these are part of national negotiations that Glasgow does not have any direction or influence over.ldquoThe impact and focus of any potential strike will be on Glasgow ndash and understandably so. But, from my perspective ndash and I utterly respect the unions making that decision ndash I also want to balance out with the disruption that it will cause to the citizens of Glasgow who simply want to go about their day-to-day business so I hope that all parties concerned will take that on board during any further national negotiations.ldquoThere will also be some unknown disruptions, whether it is activists who may block roads. I think they are very passionate about what they believe in and Irsquom delighted that they are taking action and that finally their voices are being heard but, ultimately, because of the signicance of COP, we donrsquot have any alternative option. We need to have COP. Whether it took place here in Glasgow or where in the world we would expect to have some disruption even for the simple matter of having an event attracting dozens of world leaders, which has an impact on security as well and it will have an impact on residents.ldquoHowever, I hope that residents will see the ultimate benefit of that. If we can say at the end of COP that we have delivered a sustainable, green world plan that secures the long term and longevity of our planet, I hope that disruption will have been worthwhile.Glasgow is a city which is no stranger to protest and marches for causes and the Lord Provost recognises itrsquos everyonersquos democratic right to have their voices heard.ldquoThere are officially sanctioned demonstrations taking place, including a youth march, and they are important because peoplersquos voices need to be heard, he added. ldquoActivists should be there ndash they are there with the passion that they want to see real change and that is absolutely right. I will hopefully be joining in with that because I want to add my voice to their voice to highlight to the world leaders that they must make the tough decisions and bold ambition to ensure that we deliver on a proper agreement.Mr Braat said the city had been preparing for COP for months during a time when it has been handling the Covid crisis.ldquoWhatever has been asked of us we have done on top of having to make sure that the citizens of Glasgow have stayed safe during the last  months, he added. ldquoAs a local councillor and resident in Glasgow, I am fully aware that the state of our communities and the streets we live in are very important to most people. If they are not clean, people will make their voices heard, but decisions relating to that are not in my gt as the civic leader of the city. There are other people who have been charged with those decisions and implementing them, but I am also aware that some of these decisions arenrsquot easy to take.ldquoI have been in that position myself with the previous administration when I was the city treasurer. You have to make sure that resources are available against competing demands from ious departments and stakeholders. Beyond that, I canrsquot interfere as that would be inappropriate for me as Lord Provost, but I want to say I really respect the work that all of the councilrsquos frontline staff ndash and that includes the cleansing staff, the social care sector, and anyone  in the council and in the wider public sectors ndash have done for the city during the past  months to get us through the worst times of the pandemic to the place we are now.ldquoI go out into communities throughout the city regularly and I listen to their concerns and I try to help as best as I can, whether that is feeding that information back to the relevant departments or rolling up my sleeves and helping out with litter-pick events. Thatrsquos what I see as a role I can inhabit ndash showing support and bringing a message of hope. I think the city is ready to host the best but also the most crucial and important COP in history.It is in not unusual for the Lord Provost to turn up in his jeans and get on with the job of helping communities, groupswhether it is handing out food packages during the pandemic or handing out bowls of soup at a charity project in the city, as he did just a few nights ago.This week, Glasgow council launched its draft Green Deal roadmap for the city, a nine-year mission to transform the cityrsquos economy in order to tackle the climate emergency.The Glasgow Green Deal objectives are to reduce emissions and therefore climate risk create sustainable jobs and quality places eliminate poverty and deliver justice through inclusion and equality.Mr Braat said the legacy of COP for the city will be building a greener, sustainable, Glasgow ndash and that companies will be chapping on the cityrsquos door to be here.He said: ldquoThe way forward for any city in the world will be in the green sector, producing clean and green technology and investing in clean and green industries. Many cities around the world will be desperate to seek inward investment from such companies, but I am convincedwe have the Glasgow Agreement the benefits we can reap from that will be immense.Coming into post in January  after his predecessor Eva Bolander stepped down following a row over personal items she had claimed for on council expenses as part of her civic duties, Mr Braat says he feels his term of office has been dominated by the pandemic.ldquoI might have had plans and ambitions that I wanted to do and it might have been slightly dferent but I like everyone  had to adapt to the role. I had the choice. Do I sit back or do I go out and make a positive dference and for me it was case of rolling up my sleeves and going out in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt on helping groups and volunteers with food deliveries. It was my chance to thank people for what they were doing. What I will remember about this term of office is being able to go out and might so many people and listen to their family stories and connect with communities across Glasgow. I thank all the community groups, volunteers, frontline and key workers from all sectors for what they have done for the city during the toughest of times.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13070944.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cop26-road-closures-today-clydeside-expressway-m8-junction-closed","story":"The citys Clydeside Expressway and parts of the M will be closed to drivers from pm tonight, causing ersions of up to five miles.Alternative routes for drivers who travelthrough Glasgow have been issued by Glasgow City Council.The expressway section which is parallel to theOVO Hydrowill be shut for three weeks alongside junction  of the M.Follow @transportheraldThe junction is being specically used to escortworldleaders anddelegates travelling through from Edinburgh and outside Glasgow.Diversions, which couldtake drivers as far away as Anniesland, will spark extreme congestion in the city during the conference.An aerial map of Glasgow shows the full citywill be at risk of congestion, and a ten-mile stretch of the M will be signicantly busier than usual.Here are the road closures:Local Area Traffic Management Planshave issued day-to-day maps detailing road closures and areas with high risk of congestion.Transport Minister Graeme Day said: ldquoMany months of travel planning, and preparations are now entering their final, crucial phase.ldquoThis event will be unprecedented for so many reasons and will bring its own unique challenges for Glasgow and beyond.ldquoI would urge commuters, business and the public to take some time to read the transport plan and familiarise themselves with the road closures and latest travel advice.

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will offer a three-month opportunity with a two-week residency aimed at allowing an –-year-old artist to engage with Pier Arts’ modernist art collection, network and meet with other professionals and experience Orkney’s unique environment.From Inverness to Fe, twelve organisations across the country have been awarded a total of over £, to enable them to offer early career creatives the space, support, and  to research, instigate, develop and share their creative projects.Culture Minister Jenny Gilruth said: “The Scottish Government is pleased to provide further support to young artists and creative practitioners through Creative Scotland’s Youth Arts Bursaries. This funding will help talented young people across Scotland who have been signicantly impacted by the challenges they’ve faced during the COVID- pandemic.“Supporting young people is central to our approach to COVID- recovery and it’s good to see that these bursaries have been shaped by the young people themselves to develop specic projects to advance their artistic careers.”The National Youth Arts Advisory Group  have been closely involved in the development of the programme. Youth Arts Bursary list member Laura Walker said: “It was a great experience as a young person to be a part of this decision-making-, knowing too that other young people had been involved in the assessment process before us. Not only does this allow us as assessors and decision-makers to build skills and be introduced to a professional process, but it means that we have crucial youth representation throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead, the kingdom is touting carbon capture, enabling nations to continue burning fossil fuels by sucking the resulting emissions out of the atmosphere, according to Greenpeace.The kingdom repeatedly pressed the reportrsquos authors to delete references to the need to phase out fossil fuels, as well as the conclusion that there is a ldquoneed for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales, according to the leaked documentsEarlier this month, the United Arab Emirates mdash another major Gulf Arab energy producer mdash announced it would join nations with a target to reach net-zero emissions by .The UAE did not announce specics on how it will reach this target, but said its Ministry of Climate Change and Environment will work with energy, economy, industry, infrastructure, transport, waste, agriculture and other sectors on the governmentrsquos strategies and policies to achieve net zero by .The UAE says it is home to three of the largest solar facilities in the world and is the first country in the Middle East to deploy nuclear power.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It did result in reducing the maximum numbers that could be accommodated in the room at one time so that the st and nd Tenors were only present for the first hour and the combined Bass section in the second hour.Everyone expressed how great it was to be able to sing along with the piano again, being ably played by our accompanist, Leah Greer and once more listening to detailed instructions from our Musical Director, Rea Sheils. “This past  months has been a dficult time for everyone and the choir is no exception,” outlined a choir spokesman.“But there is no doubt there were smiles under those masks from those who attended.”And the choir sends out a special invite!“If you enjoy singing and would like to come along, we meet every Monday night in the Bowling Club.

There was a strong local representation too with young people from schools right across Armagh involved in proceedings. Organised by the Church Leaders Group , the Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh, the Presbyterian Moderator, the President of the Methodist Church and President of the Irish Council of Churches all had a hand in the service. A heavy police cordon was in effect in Armagh and around St Patricks Cathedral from the early hours of the morning. Media from across Ireland had descended on the city for the service too, which was televised across the UK on the BBC and across Ireland on RTE. Before the service began, the Assistant Organist, the Revd Canon Dr Peter Thompson, played as guests arrived. The Cathedral bells rang as dignitaries arrived, including the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and the leaders of the DUP, UUP, Alliance and SDLP. The Queen, who was unable to attend, was represented by the Earl of Caledon. The opening hymn of the service O Christ the same through all our storys pages - played to the melody of Londonderry Air - was followed by a reading of scripture by the recently appointed Dean of Armagh, the Very Revd Shane Forster.  He read  Corinthians :-: Soanyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away see, everything has become new! All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. The Dean also welcomed everyone to the service. We gather here today on this ancient hill of Armagh, where St Patrick established a faith community and church over fteen hundred years ago, to reflect on the signicance of this centenary year and the long road we have travelled which also stretches out before us, he said. In this the ecclesiastical capital of this island, a centuries old place of learning and outreach, we meet together at this time, people from erse backgrounds and traditions, with dferent beliefs and aspirations, to pray for the healing of past hurts and to seek God’s guidance and hope for the future.  Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has ided us, and yet it has also on occasion brought us together. As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light filled, prosperous and peaceful future. His following prayer spoke of how we as a people had wounded each other and our communities in the past. We are sorry and ashamed and asked for your forgiveness, so that together we may move forward in faith, grow together in love, and faithfully serve you all our days. Soloist Helena Hendron, accompanied by the gentlemen of the Cathedral Choir, sang The Deers Cry, before a reading from Isiah :- by Rebecca Morris. A song of hope, Were the Future of Tomorrow, was sung by a childrens choir drawn from the local area. That was followed by a reading from St Matthew :- by Oisiacuten Walsh. The hopes, dreams and aspirations of the next generation were then given to the congregation by Lucy Addis from the Royal School, Armagh, Sean McCourt-Kelly from St Patrick’s High School, Keady, and Andrea Andrews, a pupil of La Cheacuteile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown in Dublin. Prayers were read, with the opening prayer read in Irish by Linda Ervine and Seacutean Cull. Intercessions were offered by Professor Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the conflict. Reflections were then given by the Church Leaders, with the exception of the Methodist Leader, who was giving the sermon later. ‘In Christ Alone’, a hymn written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty, who has links to the Armagh area, was then sung by the congregation. Rev’d Dr Sahr Yambasu, President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, then gave his sermon, followed by the Act of Commitment, led by Rosa McCloskey and James Chamberlain, a pupil of Markethill High School. The most symbolic act of the service saw Billy Wilson, a pupil of City of Armagh High School, carry a lantern, representing a light of hope, through the Cathedral where it was received in the santuary by the Church Leaders. Billy was accompanied by Libby Harrison from Saints and Scholars Primary School, Erika Stancuite of Mount St Catherines Primary School and Alfie Cummings who attends Armstrong Primary School. Blessings sung by the Cathedral Choir and given by the Church Leaders, then took place, before the final hymn, ‘Be Thou My Vision’."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1591282097106.jpg--covid_19_figures__thursday__october_21__2021.jpg?1591282097000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211021newscovid 19 figures thursday october 21 2021","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

I look forward to finding out more.”Many people may not share his enthusiasm, isn’t he afraid or at little a little worried  The answer is ‘no’ it seems:Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAngus Lambkin, born in Candahar Street, Belfast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAngus Lambkin, born in Candahar Street, BelfastDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “To those who might be surprised, I would say that arguably Afghanistan was less safe prior to the departure of international forces. The Taliban are not Isis and, indeed, fight against them.“And, regardless, this is what humanitarianism is, to go to areas of need and to do what can be done, cognisant of the security situation.”Pointing out that the Taliban have entered into numerous agreements regarding humanitarian assistance, he said it#s important to be positive:“Of course, there are issues, but single incidents are not indicators of trends, and similarly it is better to have one interlocutor than many.“So far the Taliban is working with a degree of coherence across many levels. Not something that many predicted.”Angus’s job is not to avoid combatants and conflict, that’s whose permission he needs to work:“My role is described as civil-military co-ordination, essentially engaging with armed actors to ensure humanitarian assistance can reach those in need in the areas they control.“We explain who we are, why we are doing what we are doing, the principles behind our work, neutrality, ‘do no harm’ etc. and we do our best to answer to any concerns that they may have.”That sounds good in theory, but does that approach always work when confronted by groups sometimes famed for their brutality “It#s not uncommon for us to have to be stopped and to have to spend a fair bit of time explaining ourselves to armed actors, mostly around how we are not working for the other side.“These can turn into extended engagements with sizeable, would-be workshops where signicant weaponry is not left at the proverbial door.“I am lucky in that these #meetings# have gone on for a bit longer than I have been comfortable with and have included concerns that their #enemy# is ready to attack, but nothing further.“Luckily for me these have been manageable and have not resulted in anything more than inconvenience, but this happens often, and colleagues are often not as fortunate.”Angus was never a stranger to navigating barriers and crossing ides. He attended Bunscoil Phobal Feirste in west Belfast as a boy before completing his schooling in Lagan College.“I benefited signicantly from the linguistic and indeed political ersity that contributed to the effort that is Bunscoil Phobail Feirste, and I benefit from that still.“The conflict wasn#t lost on me as I crossed the city after school to sing soprano in an Anglican choir with the cap-wearing boys of Belfast#s preparatory schools.“This is why everything that is integrated about education is so important. I went on to Lagan College and was encouraged to think about how relationships works and how they don#t.”How do he find his calling in international humanitarian work and how did he break into the field “I was very lucky to have a number of educational experiences which really broadened my horizons including two years in Hong Kong at the United World College there.“Traveling took me to China where I found work, and beyond I got an internship with the UN Refugee Agency. There I learnt about the plight of those in countries affected by conflict. During that time, I applied for the UN volunteer program.“Four years later, during which time I worked for a Healing Through Remembering in Belfast and Marie Stopes in Vietnam, I was accepted to deploy to the DR Congo to work on sexual violence in conflict, the previous work experience being formative in that regard.“Two years later, I got my first professional position and mostly work on humanitarian co-ordination, particularly in terms of relationships with armed forces and groups.”Angus has seen disaster, conflict, and the aftermath of slaughter, how does he feel about humanity and human nature after seeing all that “Humans are very pragmatic and will do their utmost to take care of themselves and their families,” he said. “And we very often see acts of great courage and bravery. But we also see people organise into groups and this pragmatism takes place at the expense of others.“I see it as the eternal conflict of our better selves trying to win out, sometimes succeeding, but often failing to do so.There is no doubt that we all need to work harder on our better selves.Most ReadGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceAce of space: Belfast home ideal for busy family leDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureTop VideosPlayWatch all the times Nigel Farage has been targeted by republican pranks\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayVideo: Hilarious sketch creates Irish version of Squid GameLatest Northern IrelandNathan Doak doesn’t need guided through games… he’s already class, says Ulster Rugby half-back partner Billy BurnsThomas Anderson on swapping Ulster Rugby for the world of high-end fashion: ‘It was sink or swim’Ian Baraclough can prove Irish FA are right to keep him despite some fan unrest… just like Michael O’Neill did with Northern Ireland heroics, says ex-PresidentGetting it tight  Here are  tips on how to save money during the forthcoming ‘winter of discontent’Mike Nesbitt highlights equality issues over holiday voucher schemeLatestCrusaders see fourth game in a row delayed as Dungannon Swts fixture put backMikel Arteta applauds his Arsenal players after impressive win over Aston VillaBabar Azam backs Pakistan to end unwanted record against India at T World CupReaching global climate deal will be tough, Cop president saysItalian ex-minister Salvini goes on trial for kidnap over blocked migrant ship,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FOOD: Cut your grocery spend by thousands of pounds a year by creating a weekly monthly food plan. If you only buy what you need, you won’t waste food or blow your budget.. BRANDS. Substitute branded products with value foods. Often, the only dference between supermarket brands and big names is the packaging… they taste the same and own-brands are MUCH cheaper.. LEFTOVERS. Don’t throw out leftovers. Freeze them for another day, or put them in the fridge for tomorrow’s lunch.. BARGAINS. Look for discounted foods in shops and supermarkets. Both fresh and frozen items that have been marked down can be popped in the freezer for use at a later date.. EDIBLES. When shopping at a supermarket, only buy what you can eat. Prices for non-food and non-perishable items – such as paper towels, soaps and toothpastes – can be cheaper where.. PACKED LUNCH. Save up to £ a day by bringing food to work rather than eating out. Taking a packed lunch with you on a family day out will also save you cash.. SLOW COOKER. It costs around p to use a slow cooker for eight hours compared to p an houryou’re using the oven.. LOYALTY SCHEMES. Tesco Clubcard, Sainsbury’s Nectar card and Marks and Spencer Sparks card give money off, coupons and cardholder-only offers. If you shop there anyway, you might as well get the perks.. HOLIDAYS. If you can get away when others can’t – out of season, before or after the school holidays – you’ll get a better price. It also pays to go off the beaten track, for example to Turkey rather than Spain.. CLICK AND COLLECT. Postage and packingcan double your purchase, so click and collectthere’s no free postage option.. ELECTRIC. Don’t waste money by leaving on sockets when they’re not in use. Also, turn off lights when you’re not in the room and put on another layer of clothing before turning on the heating.. APPLIANCES. When replacing a kitchen appliance, cut your electricity bills by choosing the most energy-efficient model you can afford. Consumer watchdog Which  says this can mean annual savings of £ for washing machines, £ for tumble dryers and £ for fridge-freezers.. FUEL. Petrol and diesel prices are soaring. Find out where’s cheapest and fill upyou’re in the area. Remember: A p-per-litre fuel price dference equals a £. savingfilling up a typical -litre car.. CARDS. Most debit and credit cards charge a % load on spending abroad, so £ of euros costs £. A few specialist cards give near-perfect rates and can save you a small fortune, such as Halax Clarity.. AUTO-RENEW. Never let a contract auto-renew. Look for better deals or haggle for a better price.. BUDGET BEAUTY. It’s much cheaper to get your nails, eyelashes and waxing done by trainee beauticians. Go to local beauty training schools for inexpensive or even free treatments..

He said failure to act against “this blatant breach” would make a mockery of the church.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “May the Lord have mercy on His people in Ulster who have been given such poor spiritual and political leadership in these evil times,” he said.The DUP has been asked for a response. When contacted, Rev Foster said he would leave it to the Free Presbyterian Church to decidethere would be any internal sanctions against Mr Givan.He was asked why Paul Givan shouldn’t attend as First Minister when the Queen had felt it was appropriate before taking ill. “The Queen is not a Free Presbyterian,” he said. “The Queen is not someone who has sat up and said ‘I believe in the doctrines of the Free Presbyterian Church’.“She’s the head of the Church of England which is a dogsbody for every form of filthiness. That’s the truth, theologically speaking.”Rev Foster added that he “lamented” the appetite for protest from his church had dropped away in recent years since former First Minister and Free Presbyterian founder, former DUP leader Rev Ian Paisley, performed a “political somersault and entered into an alliance with Sinn Fein”.Those attending Thursday’s widely reported event also included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as well as the leaders of the DUP, UUP and SDLP.Free Presbyterian Moderator Rev John Armstrong recently said that “this upcoming event has been arranged to promote the purposes of unscriptural ecumenism when it ought to have been a service of celebration and thanksgiving for the Lord’s hand upon our country over the past  years”.Read MoreAlf McCreary:OpinionSadly, the absence of the Queen and Michael D Higgins will be remembered long after centenary church service eventRelated topicsPaul GivanUlster Unionist PartySDLPBoris JohnsonSimon CoveneyMost ReadDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceAce of space: Belfast home ideal for busy family leSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideTop VideosPlayWatch all the times Nigel Farage has been targeted by republican pranks\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayVideo: Hilarious sketch creates Irish version of Squid GameLatest Northern IrelandNathan Doak doesn’t need guided through games… he’s already class, says Ulster Rugby half-back partner Billy BurnsThomas Anderson on swapping Ulster Rugby for the world of high-end fashion: ‘It was sink or swim’Ian Baraclough can prove Irish FA are right to keep him despite some fan unrest… just like Michael O’Neill did with Northern Ireland heroics, says ex-PresidentGetting it tight  Here are  tips on how to save money during the forthcoming ‘winter of discontent’Mike Nesbitt highlights equality issues over holiday voucher schemeLatestRare seal released back into wild after recovering from injuriesCrusaders see fourth game in a row delayed as Dungannon Swts fixture put backMikel Arteta applauds his Arsenal players after impressive win over Aston VillaBabar Azam backs Pakistan to end unwanted record against India at T World CupReaching global climate deal will be tough, Cop president says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: MonkeybusinessimagesAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTrials of a four-day working week around the world have been hailed “an overwhelming success” by some who found productivity remained the same or improved.The model is being piloted in Spain, New Zealand and Japan, and recently Belfast City Council officials said they will consider the concept for staff, with no pay cut involved.The topic has been deeply isive, so will this model ever work here Some argue reduced working time is good for wellbeing, the environment and building a prosperous economy.Others say it is not practical for some industries and sectors which can “easily be replaced by automated machines”.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said a four-day working model “simply won’t work in a job where you rely on someone from your left to then pass on your workflow to someone on your right”.The organisation represents all local manufacturing businesses, from construction, engineering and aerospace to food and clothing.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He is concerned that instead of looking at working four days as an opportunity to hire more staff to cover the time, it could be disastrous for manufacturing, where roles could become automated.“People could possibly be replaced by machinesthat is the case, and that’s not what we want to see at all,” he said.While flexible working hours can be successful in some sectors such as IT and office-based positions, Mr Kelly said it is “just not feasible when working on a production line” orthere are laws implicating your working hours.“In construction, for example, there are laws around noise, where you are not allowed to work before am and after pm, so time is limited anyway,” he explained.There is also a struggle to recruit employees in some sectors, which may mean trialling a four-day week could prove dficult.“It’s almost like we’ve come out of Covid and everyone has disappeared,” said Mr Kelly.“Businesses are doing everything they can to attract people back to work, but we’ve lost , EU nationals since , all people who came here to work, so our labour pool is smaller, and throughout the pandemic many people have decided to rethink their careers.“We are in a sticky place right now as a mixture of Covid and Brexit.”One trade union said the introduction of a four-day working week on the wages of five days could make a huge dference to workers in all sectors of the economy, particularly hospitality.Neil Moore, regional officer with Unite the Union, said wages must not be impactedit is trialled here.“There needs to be protections built-in for lower-paid workers. In particular, this move will be meaningless for those suffering the greatest exploitationthere is not action to end zero-hour contracts and ensure all contracts specy both minimum and maximum working hours in a week,” he said.“Belfast can already boast a leading restaurant which has rolled out the four-day week among its workforce, and managed to secure Michelin stars in the process.”A Co Down PR company used the pandemic to trial the four-day working week, which it admitted “has had its pros and cons”.Riki Neil, founder of RNN Communications, moved her staff from a five- to a four-day week with no salary sacrice just last year and said that it had increased the staff members’ “personal happiness” and had no impact on client delivery or results so far.“A four-day week, however, isn’t for everyone, and at times it can be challenging, but this is where the flexibility from all team members comes in, as we all have dferent days off throughout the week,” she explained.The benefits, she says, have hugely outweighed the challenges, which is why her team “is prepared to go the extra mile” and the four-day working week has remained in place for them.Barry Smyth, owner and founder of MCS Group, a specialist recruitment service for professional people, the pandemic had created “an unprecedented sht” on working le across all sectors and that introducing a four-day working week into this environment could present “major challenges” to many organisations for a iety of reasons.Many people have chosen to prioritise their work le balance and, in doing so, according to Mr Smyth, are now seeing jobs as a “straightforward transaction between employer and employee”.“Engagement levels aren’t what they were as a result and this is now driving some of the dramatic changes we are seeing in the job market, which people are calling the ‘great resignation’,” he said.“Looking at the potential for a four-day model, it is clear that there are benefits to the employee, such as reduced burnout through improved work le balance, and the piloted trials around the world unsurprisingly show that people are generally happier working less days.”The employment expert said operational complexities come with a four-day week that businesses would have to get to grips with, and the model won’t work for some jobs.“In hotels, for example, beds need changed and rooms need cleaned every day,” he pointed out.“And the same goes in healthcare settings for nursing staff or other healthcare workers.“The biggest challenge for employers trialling this is to ensure there is no disruption to services.”​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City Council PremiumHaulage industry facing Brexit and ageism issues… for a start tenants wait over a month for pest control work to be completed PremiumNI cross-community project is lting the veil on the ‘taboo’ subject of baby loss PremiumGovernment arrangements for Belfast council delegation to attend climate conference a dog’s dinner, warn Greens PremiumFormer UTV studios on Belfast’s Ormeau Road saved from demolitionMost ReadGivan slammed by reverend for taking part in ‘unbiblical’ serviceAce of space: Belfast home ideal for busy family leDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leWatch: Daniel O’Donnell’s new tropical music video ‘cheers up’ viewers worldwideSam McBrideOpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureTop VideosPlayWatch all the times Nigel Farage has been targeted by republican pranks\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_-ef-edd-ab-bfbdadfe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayChurch leaders’ message of reconciliation at Northern Ireland centenary servicePlayVideo: Hilarious sketch creates Irish version of Squid GameLatest News HeadlinesToday#s headlines: Doubt over holiday voucher scheme, Queen in hospital and Alec Baldwin accidentally shoots dead cinematographerToday#s headlines: Call for fuel payment support as gas price hike looms and public assured over NI high street voucher emailToday#s headlines: ‘This has broken me into a million pieces’ -

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards. Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland farmers have said that a new trade deal struck by the UK and New Zealand could “severely undermine” the market in Northern Ireland by allowing an influx of cheaper meat to be imported.The Ulster Farmers Union added that the family farm structure here has become “vulnerable practically overnight” and certain farming sectors have been “sold-out”.The deal allows New Zealand farmers to undercut British farmers by shipping in meat produced to lower welfare standards.It has been suggested that the deal could reduce the size of the UK economy, but with the effects unlikely to spread evenly, it could mean that Northern Ireland – which depends highly on the agriculture industry – could be hit worst.UFU president Victor Chestnutt said: “UK farming and local food production has been completely undermined by this New Zealand trade deal.“Combined with the Australia agreement at the beginning of this year, government has granted access to a signicant increase of imported food allowing it into our market, with no guarantees about how it was produced orit meets our world leading standards.”Mr Chestnutt said that it is “extremely concerning” for the red meat, dairy and horticulture farm sectors and for the public.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Our consumers – who take pride in supporting local farmers for the work that they do producing high-quality, trustworthy, local food, looking after the environment and boosting employment in rural areas – have been sold out too,” he said.“No attempt of communication was made by government as to how they would work to protect our local food production while trying to get a trade deal with New Zealand over the line.“Farm businesses across Northern Ireland and the whole of the UK, are already enduring substantially higher input costs in comparison to those farmers on the other side of the world and are dealing with ongoing labour availability.“It seems that government are either oblivious to what farmers are dealing with or have chosen to dismiss it as they have created unfair competition within our home market which will affect the sustainability of our family farms in years to come.”The UFU president is now urging the British government to adopt similar approaches to New Zealand and Australia, which invest in strategic farming, in order to safeguard and strengthen British agri-food production.“As it stands, it is very hard to see the positives of this trade deal and other countries will be watching this development with a growing drive to secure a similar agreement,” said Mr Chestnutt. “Government must explain the rationale behind this new trade deal with New Zealand immediately, highlighting how it will benefit UK agriculture, our world leading standards and the future of local food production.”Most ReadDrug dealer Noel Johnston was living ‘hand-to-mouth’ in last years of his leAce of space: Belfast home ideal for busy family leGivan

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade.     “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children.

Owner and barber, Claire Elish Craig, was nominated by herdaughter, Chloe, who posted on Facebook for Clare’s clients to fill out a survey and allow for Clare and her barbers to be nominated. googletag.cmd.push The decision is now down to an external judging  after Clare submits supporting evidence for her nomination. Clare said that the response to the survey andnominationfrom her local clients was “overwhelming. The business, open since , is Clare’s first barber shop. She said: “I have been hairdressing and barbering since I left school, some  years ago now. “I trained with James McGarvey who was my old mentor and master barber. He retired at the age of , that’s when I went out on my own. “I went on to do my advanced level and accessor award in barbering. I have given my all to this trade. “I feel I have carried a lot of the values over from James offering value for money and a friendly ear for our customers.” Clare’s husband, Michael, has been a great support for her business, “My husband has his own job working with special needs children inArdansheeschool, but he is always organising things for me, my back bone.” The Derry couplehavethree children, and now threegrandchildren. Clare says her first born granddaughteris “a shining light.” Clare said: “She has shown us that nothing is impossible with all the obstacles that she overcomes. “Through the past year and a half, it’s been a nightmare for business. “We were closed for months, then opened briefly, then closed again. The cost to make the shop safe for customers, mentally, I thought, is this it  Will we ever be able to get back to business  Will the business still be there whenever we are allowed to open  “I was extremely scared with Covid when it was time to open again. I kept asking, will my customers be safe  Will my staff be safe  Am I doing the right thing  It was definitely very tough.” When asked what winning the award would mean to her, Clare said: “All the years barbering, to me personally, it would mean the world. “A lot of my clientswho were teenagers when I started, are now coming with their own children. In some cases, I have three to four generations from the samefamily. “My shop is just not another shop, it’s an integrationinto the local community where people come to have ahaircut,a chat, unload their worries, and I to them, and they sometimes have the occasional beer.” The award ceremony will beheld December  at the Europa Hotel in Belfast. Clare added: “I want to give a special thanks to my daughter, Chloe, for nominating me.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs. Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, JUNIOR FINALColeraine v Na Magha -Sunday– OwenbegRef: Niall Clford Sundays junior final is a repeat of the  final when Deaglan Foleys point in an inspired second-half display saw city side Na Magha earn a - to - draw. Colm McGoldrick and Niall Holly scored Eoghan Ruas goals in a game that was sandwiched between their drawn football and their replay win that ended the Emmets hopes of clinching five in a row. googletag.cmd.push After winning the Ulster junior in , the Coleraine club werent allowed to compete in the Ulster series until the following year when they won Ulster again in , so it will be Na Magha who will take on the Cavan champions when the provincial series begins at the end of November, Coleraine were on the wrong end of a thumping by Swatragh in this years qualying round, losing - to - with the Davitts also hitting  wides. Liam McGoldrick, currently working in London, was absent. So too are Aidan Boyle, Niall Holly, Ciaran and Barry McGoldrick, while Ruairi Mooney came on late in the game, one of only two subs.     Na Maghas qualier with Ballinasccreen was a total contrast, as they gave Screen the scare of their lives, despite missing top scorer from the league, Tim Rankin. Cathal McDaids side were - to - up at half-time, but had no answer to a resurgent Na Magha side in the third quarter.Michael Lynch and Tomaacutes Lally ran riot from deep, with Deaglan Foley beginning to find his range. It wasnt until the second water break that the momentum began to change. If Na Magha are to launch an assault on the Ulster title, a performance and silverware would be a great start on Sunday.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

The SDLP social justice spokesperson said timely payment of the Winter Fuel Allowance was crucial this year given rising energy costs and has called for additional support to help low-income households to heat their homes this winter. googletag.cmd.push It was announced earlier this week that gas bills would rise by  per cent with electricity going up by . Mr Durkan said: “The financial consequences borne out of the COVID pandemic are becoming clearer by the day. “Rising energy costs in conjunction with increasing financial precariousness caused by the end of furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, will force many low-income households to choose between heating or eating in the coming months. “It’s clear that a warm home during the winter period is not a luxury afforded to all and I acknowledge that support mechanisms such as the Winter Fuel Payment are in place for the older cohort.     “For those vulnerable people entitled to the Winter Fuel Payment, it will be of immense value this year in particular. “However, they cannot afford the same y delays which plagued the roll-out last year whereby some claimants weren’t receiving this vital payment until February or March. “I have written to the Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey urging her to liaise with the Department for Working Pensions who administer this scheme, to avoid a repeat of last year’s disaster. “She has given assurances that most Winter Fuel Payments will be paid automatically to qualying claimants during November and December, with all payments made by  January . “No-one should ever be left without this cold-weather crutch – this year it will provide a leline for many. “I have also appealed to Minister Hargey to explore a fuel support scheme for struggling households to mitigate against the rising costs of living compounded by the financial implications of the pandemic and cut to Universal Credit. “I understand a bid has been made and discussions have begun with the Utility Regulator and those within the sector to look into additional supports for families here.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Capita were requested to attend a meeting at Derry City  Strabane Council to explain errors made by the company that affected people being able to access benefits that they were entitled to. googletag.cmd.push The firm was hired by the Department of Communities in  to carry out Personal Independent Paymentassessments. However, an Ombudsman report last June found Capita had “unfairly rejected” the applications of many claimants in the north of Ireland. The Public Services Ombudsman, Margaret Kelly, said that “repeated opportunities were missed to make the right payment as early as possible in the process” with evidence from medical professionals not being sought out and used by Capita in their assessments. Brendan Flynn of Capita addressed Derry City  Strabane District Council and apologised for the firms actions. He said: “Theres always a risk that we wont get things  per cent right all of the time.     “On the occasions where things do go wrong, we apologise, and we will continue to apologise and seek to put things right as soon as we become aware of any issue where we might have failed. We look to put in place safeguards, checks and balances and the continuous improvement processes to ensure those errors dont happen again.” However, Capitas apology cut no ice with Cllr Harkin who accused the firm of acting “callously” and called on Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey to strip them of the role of assessing benefits for people in need of them. He said: “Capitas administration of Personal Independence Paymenthas done great harm to vulnerable people seeking access to benefits.  People Before Profit demonstrating against PIP assessors Capita outside the Guildhall in Derry “The company has acted callously in its pursuit of profits. They should have no role in assessing whether or not people should be able to access any benefit. Capita isnt fit for this role. “Given Capitas atrocious record, its simply stunning that the Communities Minister decided the corporation should be rewarded with another multi-million pound contract through to . Coming into the role, axing Capita should have been number one on the list. “Its also unacceptable that the Minister refuses to implement the human rights Peoples Proposal, backed by  Councils including Derry and Strabane, to ensure dignied treatment to everyone seeking to access benefit help. “If this was a DUP Minister, Sinn Feacutein would be roasting them. Instead they tell us they have confidence in the Minister. “We are calling for Capita to hand over its profits to the Derry and Strabane hardship fund and other organisations working to mitigate the impact of poverty. “They should be ashamed to be lting profits following the devastating Public Service Ombudsman report. Companies solely interested in turning a profit shouldnt be getting their hands on extremely lucrative government contracts. “Capita needs to be booted out. The Peoples Proposal needs to be fully implemented. “We need to end the corrupt cycle of powerful corporations getting their hands on huge government contracts with the sole goal of squeezing out as much profit as possible no matter the damage caused to vulnerable people.” In response, a Capita spokesperson said: “We recognise and understand that the assessment process can be a stressful and anxious time for claimants.” “Our assessments are just one part of a wider process of evidence gathering on behalf of the Department for Communities and final PIP award decisions are made by the department. “All our assessors are qualied healthcare professionals including former NHS nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and paramedics, specially trained in assessing disability needs. The spokesperson said a sample of claimants are surveyed monthly following their PIP assessment by an independent research company. Over the last  months, more than  per cent of those surveyed have said they were satisfied or very satisfied with our service, the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they were committed to improving the quality of PIP assessments and have already begun in doing so. They said: “These include the completion of PIP award reviews in-house, where sufficient evidence is available. This has reduced referrals to the PIP assessment provider by  per cent. “The department also employs health professionals who monitor the quality of assessments reports, and from August  the independent audit of cases has been brought in-house to provide a more robust oversight and scrutiny of the quality of service provided. “Where assessments are required, officials are working closely with the service provider to reduce the need for a claimant to attend for assessment. “Officials are also taking forward initiatives to enhance customer service in response to independent reviews that have recently completed, including the second independent review of PIP and a review of the management of the PIP assessment service contract by the NI Audit Office.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top To continue reading this article, please register and log in.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The Verge hasreported that the site, which is worth nearly  billion as of last year,is planning to rebrand itself with a new name next week. It is understood that the site received the information from a source with direct knowledge of the matter. googletag.cmd.push Specically, the source claimed that Facebooks Chief Executive Officer, billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, plans to talk about the name change at the companys annual Connect conference on October . However, the source added that the new name could be unveiled sooner. In addition, the source claimed that the name change will signy the companys new mission to on expand the metaverse, which is believed to itsambition to be known for more than its social media presence. Previously, Zuckerberg told the site in July,that Facebook will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company over a number of years. In response, Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. The rebranding would position Facebooks social media app as one of many products under a parent company, which will also oversee groups like Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Many news sites, including The Irish Independent and, as well as The Verge itself, have noted that therumours come at a time when the company is facing increasing US government scrutiny over its business practices. Earlier this month, a whistleblower named Frances Haugen leaked documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated dferently by the company. Reports detailed that these leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied dferently, and in some cases not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck . Another leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders. Soon after,Facebook and its subsidiaries, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Mapillary, and Oculus, became globally unavailable for a period of six to seven hours. A separate whistleblower and former data scientist for the company, Sophie Zhang, recently testied to the British parliament that the social media site is allowing authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

In our society, that there continues to be injustice and inequality in our healthcare system is something that should shock us out of any potential apathy that all is rosy and well.ldquoAs we emerge from the pandemic, this should awaken us to action in a collective effort to take stock of where our health service is and what can be done to bring it to where it needs to be.Mr McGrath said healthcare staff must also be a priority for everyone as, without them, the health system would simply collapse.ldquoWithin the Downe Hospital for instance, we have seen staff moved about and relocated to other hospitals within the South Eastern Trust. And while it is important that the jobs of staff are secure, itrsquos also important that they have a sense of consistency and the opportunity to advance in their careers, he said.ldquoThe sad reality is that many of our staff are now burnt out a result of their work over the past  months. We need to sort out how our healthcare heroes are paid a wage that reflects the work they do and that they have proper working conditions.Mr McGrath said taking a critical look at how the ongoing waiting list is funded is also critically important which he also described as a priority moving forward.ldquoThe simple matter is that people are having to wait too long to see a consultant and the waiting lists are getting ever longer. This cannot go on, he declared.ldquoComing from a rural constituency we need to address how rural healthcare services are delivered and methodologies such as the community pharmacy can be supported in a way that enables them to challenge our rural health care needs.ldquoWhere this concerns the Downe Hospital specically is that it is essential that we have the services that meet the needs of the community. What I hear from people on the ground is that the Downe is ready to play itrsquos role,it was only supported from central government to do so.Mr McGrath said he is also conscious that many people are fearful about the future of GP services and are concerned that they cannot see their doctor.ldquoOur GP services have never been busier and our doctors work all day, every day. But the system is broken and needs to be fixed. There are many issues that are so important and need investigated and enhanced such as mental health, youth mental health, perinatal care, cancer services and more.ldquoAs I take up my partyrsquos health spokesman role, I am fully aware of the responsibility it involves and will now be endeavouring to meet with all of those stakeholder groups who I know will be instrumental in being a part of this. Irsquoll be meeting with the public to hear their thoughts as well.Mr McGrath added: ldquoA post-Covid society offers us many opportunities, but we have to seize them and make them work. The publicrsquos health is my priority and I want to ensure it remains the priority of central government..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_down.jpg","title":"Downpatrick seal Intermediate title  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK RGU ladies were crowned Senior A Intermediate champions after defeating a resilient Kilcoo side at St Malachyrsquos Park in Castlewellan last Saturday.Two quick-fire goals in the opening five minutes of the contest was enough to give Downpatrick a lead they wouldnrsquot relinquish, despite a second half surge from the Magpies in which they did everything but find that crucial second goal.The Hoops signalled their intention from the initial passage of play, winning the throw-in through the experienced Kiera Turley, before a mazy, uninterrupted run released Orla Quinn to kick over the first point of the match.Downpatrick solidied their victory through one crucial element of the game and that was winning the opposing kick-outs.This was first displayed immediately after they had registered their opening point, when Caoimhe Mulholland rose high above the rest to collect Kilcoo lsquokeeper Siobhan McEvoyrsquos punt upfield to double Downpatrickrsquos lead.McEvoy managed to successfully find a pass at the second time of asking and it wasnrsquot long before team-mate Nicole Johnston saw her effort sail over the crossbar to half the deficit.Johnston was a constant threat all day, with the Hoops backline consistently struggling to cope with her pace.The first signicant score of the tie came just a minute later when Downpatrickrsquos Mulholland found the back of the net in what was a confident and powerful finish.The green and white outfit didnrsquot lose focus and overturned possession from the kick-out. This time it was Eilis Murphy who found her effort crossing the line after evading any resistance the Kilcoo defence had to offer.However, it was not to be plain sailing for Downpatrick, as immediately the Magpies sought to get a foothold on the contest.Kilcoo responded through a Caitriona Kane free, which was a reoccurring theme throughout the match. And one minute later, Kane once again converted from a free as her side began to enter the tie.There was a notable battle between Downpatrickrsquos Turley and Kilcoorsquos Laura Morgan, as the two tussled in what was a case of who wanted control of the possession more.Some neat triangle passing allowed Hoops forward Aisling Flynn to notch her first point of the game, before Adair Trainor overturned possession to release Cara Tumelty, who added further to RGUrsquos tally.Kilcoo displayed their class through Kane after an array of eye-catching passes found its way to the boot of the number , resulting in an applauded point.The scoreline would have been much closer at this stage had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of player-of-the-match Kirsty Carling, who saved magnicently to deny a certain Magpies goal.Yet again Downpatrick did not allow themselves to be discouraged by the opposition, as Tumelty responded promptly with another point to close the scoring before the first water-break.The Hoops picked up where they left off as Tumelty pointed from a free after the restart, although her next effort just went the wrong side of the posts.Mulholland was in fine form as she dribbled past two opposing Kilcoo players to allow Tumelty to score a trio of unanswered points for her Downpatrick side.With  minutes gone, Kilcoo began ramping up their attacks and were nearly rewarded when Ceallach McEvoy played a lovely weighted pass over the RGU backline to allow Johnston through on goal.Showing the Downpatrick defence a clean pair of heels, Johnston seemed certain to put the ball in the back of the net. But, it was that woman Carling again who pulled off a terric save from point-blank range to a keep daylight between the sides.Mulholland pointed from a free at the other end of the pitch before Kilcoorsquos Kane replied with the same to keep her team present in the contest.The halftime whistle sounded to leave the scores - to - in favour of Downpatrick.It was very much a game of two halves as the teams ed to the pitch after the interval with Kilcoo immediately winning the throw-in before setting off on the charge downfield.Kane kicked over a point from range before Johnston secured another for the black and white outfit.A couple of wides occurred for both sides within the next few minutes, although the weather did take a turn for the worse, with rainfall and windy conditions beginning to increase.Kilcoo continued their onslaught with a Morgan point from open play, as Downpatrickrsquos Flynn saw her effort drt narrowly off the mark. But theMagpies continued their pressure and were soon awarded with a free  metres from goal.Dearbhla McGreevyrsquos effort ped just under the crossbar and was now causing all sorts of bother for Downpatrickrsquos Carling.The Hoopsrsquo number one watched the shot all of the way but could only slap the ball into the path of the onrushing Ceallach McEvoy, who bundled it over the line in the last piece of action before the second water-break.A terric  minutes for the Magpies meant that there was just a single goal separating the sides in the last quarter with the score - to - in favour of the Hoops.There was now a tense atmosphere both from the players on the pitch and the surrounding supporters, who had turned out to watch the final.Downpatrick goalscorer Murphy kicked over a point to finally get her side off the mark in the second half, although this was promptly answered with a fine solo point from the ever-present Johnston.As the clock ticked down, the tie was still very much in the balance when Tumelty registered another point to add to her impressive personal tally.With one last throw of the dice, Kilcoo charged down the pitch but was met with a plethora of green and white shirts who forced Kane to shoot from distance and settle for the point.That signalled the last score of the game as the final whistle was blown to cue pandemonium from the Downpatrick outfit and their management team.After the match, Downpatrick joint senior ladiesrsquo manager J R Loudon reflected on his sidersquos performance and season as a whole.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable, we took these girls way back in February and this was their end goal, he said. ldquoTheyrsquore a great bunch and we have a  of around  to  players. The feeling in the club as a whole at the minute is fantastic.ldquoMost of these girls are of minor age as wersquove lost a lot of our more experienced players to other commitments, so what they have achieved is remarkable.The manager added: ldquoWe knew Kilcoo were going to play using a sweeper, so we wanted to force their lsquokeeper into a long kick out that we were confident we would win. That game was won on the training ground.Kilcoo: S McEvoy, L Devlin, C McEvoy, C McClean, C McEvoy, E McEvoy, M Rogan, L Morgan, D McGreevy, R Doherty, C Kane, S Fettes, E Doyle, K Laverty, N Johnston.Subs: B McAneney, C McCrickard, C OrsquoRourke, C McEvoy Ireland, N OrsquoReilly, S McAneney, K Greenan, K McEvoy.Downpatrick: K Carling, C McKervey, O Boyle, O Beattie, N Loudon, A Trainor, V Scullion, K Turley, P Smyth, O Quinn, C Mulholland, K Convie, E Murphy, A Flynn, C Tumelty.Subs: M Shannon, R Trainor, A Doran, S Sloan, K McLeigh, G Scullion, N Madine, A Murphy, E McIlmurry, M Kelly, S Rice, K Trainor, M Ross..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20thOctober2021_cd.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 24%2C 2001  ","story":"BISHOPSCOURT ndash The sale of Bishopscourt Motor Racing Circuit should be clinched later today.It has also been confirmed that the sprawling track, which was put on the market at the start of the month, will remain a race circuit.Yesterday afternoon the circuitrsquos current owners, David Beattie and John Gfin, were locked in crucial talks with potential owner, Jim OrsquoBrien from Newry, in a bid to finalise the deal.Although the going price for the circuit has not yet been confirmed it is believed the final bid may be in the region of half a million pounds.Last month the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surround its future.

This is just one of a number of similar incidents against council staff which have taken place in the area over the past few months.It is believed the people responsible for the recent attacks are members of a teen gang that has been running havoc in the village since before the summer.The same gang has been blamed for the brutal killing of a cat, which was burnt alive in the village last month. Its burnt carcass was left on display with a beer can between its paws and a cigarette in its mouth.One local resident recently claimed that people in the village are living in fear of the gang that continues to vandalise and destroy property in the village.

Today, the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee is due to endorse a plannersrsquo recommendation to give permission for four new homes to be built on a quarter acre sloping site it owns at one of Killyleaghrsquos biggest housing developments.Council officials have earmarked a strip of open space land in front of homes at Grove Gardens at the Kerry estate located off the Downpatrick Road for the new homes.Ten letters and one petition objecting to the proposal were submitted to planners with the scheme part of the local authorityrsquos plan to sell off surplus land and buildings it owns across the district to generate cash.While the council does not build homes, residents opposed to its plan believe that the local authority is seeking planning approval which will signicantly increase the value of the land which it can then sell to the highest bidder.The plannersrsquo recommendation to grant outline permission for the land at Grove Gardens has angered residents and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker.It was confirmed earlier this year that none of the statutory agencies consulted about the proposal had objections, with the local authority pointing to the need for additional social housing in Killyleagh and a lack of available land to build new homes .In addition, the council contends that redeveloping the small portion of land at Grove Gardens would have ldquominimal impact on existing open space land and that the housing proposal will improve the estate physically and the attractiveness of Grove Gardens, ldquoproviding a quality and sustainable residential environment, better parking provision, a new vehicle turning area, additional footpaths and wider roadway.However, itrsquos a view not shared by residents or Cllr Walker who lives in nearby Grove Park.He said while arguments not to develop the land have failed, he is encouraging residents to object to any subsequent planning applications for full permission which will inevitably be forthcoming.ldquoThe case has been made by residents and myself that this piece of ground is simply not suitable for four homes, but planners disagree with us which is disappointing, he continued. ldquoWhile opposed to this proposal, I remain a passionate supporter of social housing and have worked alongside others to provide much-needed new accommodation and identy potential development sites.ldquoWhat we are talking about here is a proposal to make Newry, Mourne and Down Council a quick buck. This particular area of land is not suitable for social housing. I have no doubt thatan application to build private homes at this part of Killyleagh it would be refused.The Rowallane politician said while social housing provision is ldquoabsolutely critical given recent news that there are , people across the district looking for homes, the Grove Gardens site is inappropriate.He said that several years ago, along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, the pair were able to persuade roads officials to widen the road in front of existing homes at Grove Gardens to ensure emergency vehicles could gain access.Cllr Walker said while the local authorityrsquos outline planning application will be rubber-stamped later today, there is still some way to go before builders can move on site. He added: ldquoExisting homes at Grove Gardens would overlook the planned four semi-detached properties and I believe there is an issue in relation to peoplersquos privacy. Clearly, the planners donrsquot agree with me.ldquoI remain perplexed that planners view a piece of sloping ground as suitable for new housing. It is not in my opinion and, along with residents, I do not support to this proposal. There are more appropriate sites in my opinion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/portaferry(1).jpg","title":"Preservation order could help save trees  ","story":"A PRESERVATION order from the Department of Infrastructure may save trees earmarked for removal to build a new car and coach car park at the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry. A local campaign group mdash Portaferry Stop The Chop mdash applied for a tree preservation orderafter Ards and North Down Council rejected their alternative plans which would have reduced the number of planned parking spaces by nine, but saved most of the mature trees.The Department for Infrastructure confirmed this week that it is considering whether or not to make a TPO to protect trees, with a spokesman confirming that before deciding the matter, the Department must first consult with the local authority.ldquoFollowing formal consultation, the Department is now awaiting the views of council, the spokesman added.The matter will be discussed at the full council meeting next Wednesday with the organisation planning to invest pound, to clear the Portaferry site in order to create a new car and coach car park, new toilets, paths and lighting improvements in the Ropewalk area.The project aims to provide improved facilities for visitors to Exploris and the village and is viewed as a much-needed improvement in the wake of the planned poundm aquarium at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. This proposal will mean that Exploris will no longer be the only aquarium in Northern Ireland.The new car-park, which has received funding from the Department for Infrastructure, should have been completed by November, but the council succeeded in getting an extension to the funding until January. However, Cathie McKimm from the campaign group, claimed that the council had wrongly given itself approval to remove the trees.ldquoThe council had not done environmental screening in its plans, which they are now doing and gave themselves unlawful permission to chop down the trees, she explained.ldquoWhen we wrote to the DfI, the planning headquarters wrote back to say that under the new legislation introduced in  when responsibility for planning transferred to councils, Ards and North Down was not allowed to give itself permission to chop down trees on land that it owned in a conversation area.She said that the council applied on September  to remove the trees which was followed up by the campaigners applying for the TPO.ldquoAll we know is that the trees are not saved yet, the original proposal is still on the table, said Ms McKimm.ldquoI have no confidence in this council to listen to what the community wants. Nearly , people signed a petition against this proposal and we reckon  per cent of those are from the Ards and North Down Council area.The group held a free concert, headlined by musician Colum Sands, at Portaferry Community Centre last Sunday in order to raise more public awareness of their concerns for the trees.Last year, the Co Down songwriterrsquos story-poem about the award-winning Invisible Tree of Rostrevor Oakwood, was given voice by neighbours and environmental campaigners aged from nine to  in the short film, Rhyme for Justice .Ards poet, Moyra Donaldson, wrote a poem for the  trees at Portaferry which was read out at the event, along with other poetry inspired by the local area.Lily Devlin, who started the campaign to save the tree, said that she and other campaigners in Portaferry have been ldquohumbled and inspired by the great support they have received in their campaign to save the trees, not just from local people and those from the Borough, but from all around the world.Speaking on behalf of the group she said: ldquoOver , people have now signed our petition mdash a testimony to the strength of opposition to the plans to destroy beautul trees in the heart of our historic town, for a car park, of all things.ldquoWersquove been trying as best we can to reason with the council over this absurd decision and get it to reconsider its plans but, to date, it has not taken its proposal to fell  trees for new parking off the table.A council spokeswoman confirmed that an updated report on the Portaferry Ropewalk Improvement Scheme will be brought to the full meeting next Wednesday and will include consideration of the Department for Infrastructurersquos proposals for a TPO in the area.She stressed that the council had not been aware of the need to get planning permission from the DfI for the removal of the trees until August.ldquoThis legislation had not been referenced by DfI Planning in any previous correspondence with the council about the proposed Scheme, she said. ldquoThe legislation requires the council to gain consent from DfI Planning for works carried out to any trees on land owned by the Council and within a conservation area.ldquoThis is anomalous with the Scheme of Delegation that DfI Planning has already approved for the council in relation to the decisions the Planning Committee can determine. However, having sought legal advice, the council has applied to DfI Planning for consent.The spokeswoman said that as per the councilrsquos standard procedures, the agenda for the meeting and a copy of the updated report will be available to the public on the councilrsquos website within  hours of them being made available to elected members..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Saintfield getting in bloom  ","story":"SAINTFIELD has again been recognised for its floral excellence after picking up third spot in the large village category at this yearrsquos Ulster in Bloom competition.Now in its rd year and sponsored by Translink, the transport companyrsquos Market Street base in Downpatrick came third in the bus station category.The annual awards celebrate the fantastic work of green-fingered gardening enthusiasts across the country, with the much-loved annual horticultural, environmental and community competition officially recognising the most beautul plant and floral displays across cities, towns and villages.Translink chairman, Michael Wardlow, said the company is proud of its long-standing role in Ulster in Bloom and it was great to see the competition grow each year, with  entries representing all local council areas as well as  bus and train stations entering this year.ldquoIt is heartening to see such fantastic demonstrations of community spirit in action, especially given the challenging times everyone has experienced, he continued.ldquoThese awards clearly highlight the pride so many have for their local areas.

In the absence of both John Donnan and James Simpson, Bradley Luney started in the second row and Jack Milligan came in at out half with Greg Hutley moving into midfield to cover the loss of Tagen Strydom.Shane Ball and Paddy Wright swapped positions as Adam Craig and his coaching team searched for the right formula in attack.Trinity were fresh off a demolition of UCD in the colours match and were able to choose from a full squad with Leinsterrsquos Liam Turner in midfield and highly regarded Ulster Academy prospect Harry Sheridan in the second row.Leinster senior squad regular Jack Dunne continued his rehab from injury with a place on the Trinity bench.Ballynahinch started badly with handling errors and a misfiring line-out inviting pressure.Despite some high quality scramble defence, they found themselves seven points down after a series of Trinity carries pinned them on their own line and quick hands and some good footwork took Max Faria over for a converted try.This was compounded by the loss of Milligan and prop Ben Cullen to injury.Another excellent defensive set allowed Ballynahinch time to dig in and they began to take the game to the students as the half wore on.A strong maul earned them a penalty on  minutes which Hutley knocked over from  metres to get his side on the board.Turner made a brilliant break just before half time but more superb scrambling kept the half time deficit at just four points.Ballynahinch had much the better of the opening exchanges of the second half and after going close to scoring a try, another Hutley penalty left the game delicately balanced.Turner then stamped his class on proceedings with a superb outside break on the Ballynahinch -metre line, opening up the defence for winger Marcus Kiely to score. Trinity then turned up the heat in the forwards and sealed the result with a close range try from a fine line-out move involving Dunne and Sheridan in the st minute.Thirteen points down with  minutes to go, Ballynahinch could have folded but they gamely stuck to their task and showed all their fighting spirit by attacking the Trinity line.They were rewarded with a try from Hutley on the gamersquos final play as he exploited the numerical advantage in the Trinity backline following a yellow card. He then calmly knocked over the conversion to salvage a point for his side.Despite opening with three defeats, Ballynahinch have shown improvement with each match and will be confident that they can soonto winning ways.They have a week off to regroup and rehab some injured players before the visit of table-topping Garryowen to Ballymacarn Park on October .Ballynahinch: B Cullen, T Stewart, K McCall, T Donnan, B Luney, Z McCall, O Loughead, C Irvine, C Gibson, J Milligan, A Cairns, G Hutley, R Wilson, P Wright, S Ball, J Hanlon, H Simpson, T Martin, D Souza, C McAuley, R Patterson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"UUP selects Macauley to contest Assembly election  ","story":"THE Ulster Unionist Party has selected Jill Macauley to contest next yearrsquos South Down Assembly election.A former Newry, Mourne and Down councillor, Mrs Macauley has secured the backing of her party and received a ringing endorsement from leader Doug Beattie.Mrs Macauley mdash who is a member of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council mdash said she is ldquodelighted to have secured her partyrsquos nomination to contest one of the five seats up for grabs.At the  Assembly election, Harold McKee was the UUP flag bearer and polled , votes, with the party confident that it can make a serious push for a seat when voters go to the polls next May.Based in Rathfriland, Mrs Macauley is one of the UUPrsquos most senior figures and having served as a councillor in two local authority areas, she now feels the time is right to ldquostep up and give the electorate of South Down a chance for change and a chance for positive and hardworking -pro-Union representation at Stormont.She described her work as a local representative as a ldquoprivilege, allowing her to meet and work with ldquosome wonderful people and great organisations within the constituency who do sterling work to support local communities and those most in need.Mrs Macauley revealed she has been working hard over recent months to grow the local UUP membership and said the optimism and resolve for a ldquomore confident and inclusive unionism has allowed her to continue working effectively with her party colleagues on a range of issues.She said these included the childrenrsquos funeral fund, transfer test, school unorm costs, disability and special educational needs improvement and period poverty.ldquoWe have a fantastic hardworking team of local councillors, working on the ground, always accessible and working for the greater good of local people, said the Assembly candidate.ldquoI want to thank my fellow councillors for the help and support they have given me thus far and encouraging me to step forward for election to the Assembly and the opportunity to lead our local team, as we strive to continue to be the strongest voice for Unionism right across South Down.Mrs Macauley said she hopes to prove that she is on their side and will be a strong voice for positive, confident Unionism.She added: ldquoFrom Katesbridge to Kilkeel and from Warrenpoint to St Johns Point, I have a bold, positive, ambitious vision for our people of South Down and am prepared to work with anyone to make that a reality.ldquoFor too long, we have been trapped in a perpetual cycle of fear and ision, resulting in every election becoming a constitutional show of strength rather than a mandate for socio-economic change. Change that we so desperately need.Mr Beattie said that when he became party leader he made two pledges, including bringing more women into the party and reaching out into rural communities to give a  to those from the community to speak on its behalf.ldquoWho better to do that than Jill Macauley, he continued. ldquoA woman who lives and breathes her community and I am delighted that she has agreed to take on the role of our South Down Assembly election candidate.ldquoAs a mum and businesswoman, Jill is tuned into the community and the needs of local businesses, the vital fishing and farming industries, economic tourism potential as well as the complex needs of young families.Mr Beattie said Mrs Macauley has a proven track record of working hard for the electorate and has no doubt she will offer an ldquoauthentic voice for the pro-Union voters of South Down.

Did the other church leaders not know he was going to speak in that way  If they did, why did not one of them gently contradict him with another view  Photo by Jonathan Porter   Press EyeIn no way did it celebrate Northern Ireland. It was a cross-border church service about partition. Indeed the organisers were at pains to say it was not a celebration.Fine. Butit is going to be entirely neutral about Northern Ireland, then a separate service of thanksgiving of our country should have been held this year.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It would be essential to have a royal at such a service of thanksgiving for one of the four home nations of the United Kingdom.On Thursday there was no royal presence, all the more regrettable given the snub of the service by President Michael D Higgins of Ireland, a man who has several times scolded Britain for its history.The most striking comment at the service was by the Roman Catholic Archbishop Eamon Martin, who spoke pointedly of the pain and loss in his community at partition.BBC Northern Ireland led Thursday’s TV evening news bulletins not on this much-discussed service but on a tragic story about a sex attack victim. It then introduced its report on the service by highlighting the criticism of Archbishop Martin.While I think this showed troubling editorial judgement, the BBC could argue that the archbishop’s criticism was the most notable comment of the day. After all, Archbishop Martin was not countered, even obliquely, by the other churchmen who spoke. Why not Did their communities not also suffer great pain, for example in the Troubles Given the scrutiny of this event, did they not know Archbishop Martin was going to say that  He wrote an article in the  this week that included stinging criticism of Northern Ireland’s history.Andthey did know, did not one of them think that a dferent and positive assessment of Northern Ireland should be aired in light of that very public criticism, which became BBC NI’s lead line This was by far the biggest Northern Ireland centenary event to date after a year in which there has been no major occasion to rejoice in the country that the great majority of the population here love and identy with .If it was not for the Covid restrictions of this year, the timid handling of the th birthday of Northern Ireland would be a scandal. But even given that context of limits on gatherings the approach to the centenary has been pitul. We now have big sporting events and rock concerts taking place. Yet the centenary of this wonderful country of almost two million people has been much less visible than the publicly funded annual West Belfast festival, which ended this year in another concert at which a crowd chanted IRA slogans. Today we report on the barriers that Sinn Fein has put in the way of centenary events . But they are allowed to have a veto, so we need the UK government to step up to the mark. Yet its showcase service seemed to have little direct association with Northern Ireland. It was asit was about the northern half of Ireland or maybe just about Ireland. Perhaps it was about global peace.It had lessons in Irish, prayers in Irish, other phrases in Gaelic too. Some fine Irish music. All good. But I saw little that was recognisably British at the service. If it was important to have Irish culture represented, then why not British, given that the unionist population takes such comfort from the existence of Northern Ireland  The Union flag — representing the nation which has sovereignty here by popular consent — was missing apart from Boris Johnson having it on his mask. Nor did I hear much that you might describe as distinctively Northern Irish .The Methodist president Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu referred to the slavery of St Patrick and the later slavery from Africa, saying people’s colour was used to diminish their humanity. He condemned the partition of that continent . Rev Dr Ivan Patterson talked of the need to hear the voice of NI’s dferent ethnicities and traditions. This is true. But the service did not mention our generosity to immigrants, and the new lives Northern Ireland has offered them.There were references to climate change but none to the scientists, engineers and business folk who shaped our  years as a distinct jurisdiction on this island. Or the leaders who, for the first  years of NIput it decades ahead of the  independent counties in matters from infrastructure to the welfare state to elementary rights such a orce. No references to the sports people, actors or other luminaries who have reflected our sense of ourselves as a distinct society.You might say a church service is not a rollcall of achievements. But it should at a minimum have had a specic reflection for the many people who from  gave their lives in service of Northern Ireland, a country that was expected not to survive but has lasted a century.I felt almost surprise when the Anglican Archbishop John McDowell described his working class unionist roots as “an immensely rich culture”. He was quick to add that his mother had “a strong sense of Irish identity” too.A rare moment of recognition of our country was when the Presbyterian moderator Dr David Bruce said “I love” Northern Ireland . In fact it was one of the few times I heard the words Northern Ireland uttered.If church was not the place to champion Northern Ireland, what other planned event will  The Feile crowd was estimated at ,. Where is the NI centenary event of such scale  It was bad that no royal was present. The Queen is blameless for that. Aged , Her Majesty is  years older than the retirement age of  for working women of her generation, yet her ongoing commitment to public duty is beyond doubt. It transpired that she spent Wednesday night in hospital and we all wish her well.But why was no senior royal’s diary cleared long ago for October , so they were on standby in case a monarch of such advanced years was unable to travel I consider all of the royals blameless for the absence. I have reported on most of them on visits here and do not doubt their commitment to this part of the UK. It is the government that should have made clear to the royal family the value they attached to an NI ceremony, particularly after the Higgins snub.Instead, our biggest event was a service that seemed to follow a Northern Ireland Office view of NI as a place that is neither British nor Irish, and the history of which is best left unmentioned, unless it is criticised as sectarian.See Billy Kennedy, page  of the Weekend Print edition• Billy Kennedy: Queen’s absence left a huge void at centenary service• ‘Sinn Fein determined to start culture war with unionism’: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf you think that imagined scenario is a little bit outlandish then reflect not only on some of the wilder speculation on social media but even within the pages of a Sunday newspaper last weekend about the Union’s future. One writer speculated that when the Queen eventually dies the Union could be plunged into peril. While across outlets like Twitter nationalist commentators and the usual trolls went into hyper drive when it was announced that the Queen would not be attending the ceremony at Armagh Cathedral to mark the th anniversary of Northern Ireland’s foundation.Never mind that the monarch is -years-old and apparently in such frail health that her doctors recommended she miss the event. Following that medical advice it emerged later that the Queen had been admitted to hospital in London for tests.None the less some in the media conjectured that the Queen’s non-attendance was in reality linked to Irish President Michael D Higgins’ boycott of the ecumenical religious service that somehow the absence of the British monarch avoided the “embarrassment” of only having one head of state at Armagh from these islands for all those photo-ops inside and outside St Patrick’s Cathedral.Meanwhile, on social media networks incredulity was stretched even further by those who interpreted the Queen’s non-appearance as somehow a slap in the face by the London establishment for unionists.Like the biblical star shining in the east the monarch’s absence was seen as a sign that the Brits have started their exit strategy from Northern Ireland. Which is almost as ludicrous in terms of logic and evidence as the thesis advanced last weekend that the passing of the current monarch also heralds the break-up of the UK.Amid all this frenzied wishful thinking it is important toto the facts. This type of hysteria has been fuelled by Brexit and especially the weaponisation of EU membership to advance the cause of Irish unity. However,you analyse the results of four credible opinion polls from the year the UK voted to leave the EU it is clear there has been no real tangible “Brexit-effect” on support for staying in the UK.The  Ipsos Mori poll taken after the Brexit vote showed support for the Union being over %.A year later a survey for Queen’s University Belfast found almost exactly the same backing for the Union, again more than %.Two years later in  the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies also found more than % in favour of staying in the UK.In  the Northern Ireland Le and Times Survey reported that % still opted for the Union rather than a united Ireland.The reasons for this solid base support for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK it is fair to presume are not based on intangible factors such as widespread genuine admiration for the Queen or love for the monarchy.Other far less ethereal or symbolic causes come into play here: the desire to stay in a nation with the fth largest economy in the world the free at point of use NHS the support system via the Barnett Formula provided by the UK Treasury to poorer regions including Northern Ireland a state that is multi-cultural and erse and the deeply ingrained visceral historic, familial, social connections that straddle both sides of the Irish Sea.Conversely the two-tier, American-style semi-privatised health system in the Republic the Irish State’s mounting national debt, the highest in Europe a punishing personal taxation regime and a resurgent neo-nationalism brought on in part by the decade of commemorations are among the repellent factors that will convince many to remain within the UK rather than link up with the Republic.These are the dynamics that will determine the future of the Union rather than who sits on the throne across the water. To posit the end of the longest reign of any British monarch could hasten the break up of the UK, or even that her non-attendance at a single event is a signal that it is already happening, is as absurd as waiting for the ravens to fly off from the Tower of London.• Ben Lowry Oct :Centenary church service should have celebrated Northern Ireland• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : I stand by my assessment of Fathers Gerry Reynolds and Alec Reid• Henry McDonald Oct : I am an atheist but I miss hearing Preacher Man on the streets of Belfast• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

This is good news for a iety of reasons, including two key ones.First, global pollution of the oceans is one of the biggest environmental challenges in the world, with plastics and discharges. Yet across Northern Ireland, people can be reassured that they are bathing in clean and safe waters.Second, lockdown has produced a renewed interest in the province’s outdoors. It is one of the upsides of the Covid rules that we have reconnected with NI’s countryside and waters. In particular, there has been an upsurge in outdoor swimming at locations such as Helen’s Bay on the northern coast of Co Down, one of the beaches rated excellent.Swimmers are taking a dip through the winter there.Now that the beaches are reaffirmed as being of bathing quality, our politicians should be thinking of how we can increase insufficient parking space at popular beauty spots where cars are often being turned away. We should encourage those people who want to enjoy the simple pleasures of rural and coastal Northern Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, despite broad support, the project was vetoed by Sinn Fein on the grounds that it reflected “only one political perspective”. Earlier this month Sinn Fein, the largest bloc on Mid Ulster Council, blocked three landmark buildings being illuminated blue and green, along with a number of others across the UK, to mark the NI centenary.SF councillor Niamh Doris said she opposed the “celebration of something that deserves no celebration, which is the partition of this island”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak..

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why. What did I want from le  What was important to me  I had no idea.Ms Hall, who has three daughters ndash aged , , and one ndash began to lose interest in herself and others and stopped taking care of herself she isolated herself and drank too much alcohol, trying to hide from le.She was getting ill but thought it would pass. Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book. I hope it helps one or more people ndash I had to hit a wall to get help, but you donrsquot have to do that!Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work is available at Grfin Books in Penarth and online via Amazon.Itrsquos had positive feedback which you can read at https:amzn.to vqNVbuGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
