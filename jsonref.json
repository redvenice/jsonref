The standard rental allowance rose to more than £22,000. In 2017 the allowance per child was increased from £2,425 to £5,435. It meant an MP with three dependent children could be entitled to a total allowance of almost £40,000 a year to rent a second home in London.Other MPs who have claimed for adult children include Tory Jack Lopresti, who lives with his wife, fellow Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns. In 2017, he incorrectly registered to claim up to £10,870 for two dependents.He said it referred to children from his former marriage, who are over 18. The MP, an aide to Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, said the claim was an ‘error’ and repaid £202 incorrectly claimed in 2017-18.Rebecca Pow, a government aide to Amber Rudd, incorrectly claimed £629 in rent in 2017-18 for a dependent and continues to be registered for children, who are all in their twenties. She said she would repay overclaimed money.Labour MP Gill Furniss has one registered dependent youngster, but her three children are aged between 19 and 34. She claimed £91 in 2017-18 but declined to explain why she had claimed that sum. "},{"url":null,"title":"Un Australian pub blasted banning mullet","story":"Share this article \u0027Prejudice starts with bull**** like this and leads to venues refusing entry to people for all sorts of stupid reasons.    \u0027Furthermore, after initially asking why this rule exists on the Ric\u0027s Facebook page, my post was removed by Ric\u0027s after no explanation was offered.\u0027If Ric\u0027s staff and management continue to enforce this, generalisation and stereotypes will continue to plague Brisbane, and ultimately Australia.\u0027          \u0027How does my haircut suggest I\u0027m going to hit someone?

Tánaiste Simon Coveney and cabinet office minister David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, signed the agreement in London on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council (BIIGC).“Our message to Irish citizens in the UK is that your rights will not change. You will still be able to move freely between Ireland, the UK and the islands.“You will still be able to work, study, draw your pension and access social security and public services in the UK. Above all, you will be welcome. And we welcome the similar commitment the Government of Ireland makes to British citizens in Ireland,” Mr Lidington said.Mr Coveney said the agreement should reassure British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in Britain that, regardless of whether Britain leaves with or without a deal, their rights and privileges would be protected. “This Memorandum of Understanding is comprehensive but it’s also flexible enough to be able to be updated and changed in the future if necessary and will be backed up with legislation in the necessary areas,” he said. Mr Lidington and Mr Coveney were joined by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley for the two-hour BIIGC meeting. Established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, the BIIGC did not meet from 2007 until last July but met again last November.Wednesday’s meeting focused on the future of the east-west relationship, economic cooperation, security issues in Northern Ireland and legacy issues as well as the Stormont talks.“The theme running through this is how we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation on everything from economic regeneration to security and justice. We obviously very much welcomed the resumption this week of talks aimed at restoring the Executive at Stormont,” Mr Lidington said. The memorandum of understanding sets out an agreed policy framework for the CTA, which not only guarantees free movement of people between Britain and Ireland but covers access to social security, health and education. The two governments have agreed to maintain existing arrangements on social insurance, child benefit and pensions. They have also agreed to work on new arrangements to ensure that British and Irish citizens will continue to have equal access to public health and education services in both countries.Newcastle University’s Colin Murray, a legal academic in the research project NI Constitution who campaigned for the CTA to be codified, said the agreement had been largely settled for months. “It is being concluded now because there is a period of relatively low tension in the Brexit negotiations, because the Irish and UK governments being seen to work together supports the drive towards a deal on restoring power-sharing institutions within Northern Ireland, and because, from the Irish Government’s perspective, Theresa May might not be long in office, and the CTA therefore needs to be locked down,” he told The .Business groups welcomed the agreement and John McGrane, director general of the British-Irish Chamber, said the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland brought tangible economic benefits.“The CTA helps support the €70 billion annual trade between our countries. It has resulted in there being more Irish Directors of UK companies than any other foreign nationality and it has contributed to Irish companies being the fifth largest foreign owners of UK firms,” he said.“Today’s agreement will go some way to protecting these achievements. However, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce remains clear in its view that the best way of protecting the economic and social links between these islands is through an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU followed by an unprecedented close future relationship. We encourage public representatives on all sides to work together to make this happen.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3889242.1557577453!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bbc pulls have i got news for you show over heidi allen impartiality","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             The BBC  pulled the latest episode of Have I Got News For You after the broadcaster said it would have been ‘inappropriate’ for Change UK leader Heidi Allen to be a guest.

Photograph: Reuters The BBC pulled the latest episode of Have I Got News For You television show last night after the broadcaster decided it would have been “inappropriate” for Change UK leader Heidi Allen to be a guest ahead of the European elections.The comedy quiz show, which airs on BBC One and questions guests on the week’s top news stories, tweeted shortly before the pre-recorded programme was due to air to say it had been withdrawn.The broadcaster referred to its editorial guidelines after they announced the episode of the panel show, with Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, would be broadcast at a later date.In a tweet, Have I Got News For You’s official account said: “Sorry everyone.“The BBC have pulled tonight’s edition of #HIGNFY - no, we didn’t book Danny Baker. “We booked Heidi Allen, a member of a party no-one knows the name of (not even the people in it), because the Euro elections, which nobody wants, may or may not be happening.Scheduled for 9pm on BBC One, the show was replaced with Would I Lie to You?, which should have aired afterwards.In response, Twitter users pointed out that Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had been a panellist on BBC Question Time on Thursday.Following the announcement, Ms Allen, who left the Conservatives alongside her colleagues Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston earlier this year to join the new party, said an explanation was needed.The MP for South Cambridgeshire tweeted: “Maybe I’m just not as funny as Nigel Farage eh #hignfy haveigotnews !? He’s so funny, he seems to be on the BBC all the time!“An explanation would be appreciated, not least to acknowledge the hard work of the entire crew who worked diligently to put the show together.”European Parliament elections will take place in the UK on May 23rd.A BBC statement said: “The BBC has specific editorial guidelines that apply during election periods.“Because of this it would be inappropriate to feature political party leaders on entertainment programmes during this short election period, which does not allow for equal representation to be achieved.“So we will not broadcast the scheduled episode of HIGNFY featuring Heidi Allen, leader of Change UK. We will look to broadcast this episode at a later date.”A Have I Got News For You source said: “The BBC told us late this afternoon that they had decided to pull the show. This was because Heidi Allen was on the panel, and, in their judgement, we’re officially in an election period. And she’s officially a party leader.”The source added: “We tried everything we could to get the BBC to broadcast it. We even offered to blur Heidi Allen’s face and replace her voice with an actor. Apparently that ”wasn’t helpful“.“It was a cracking show, and everyone at Hat Trick is sorry you’re not going to see it tonight. We’ve always felt that HIGNFY is at its best when it bites the hand that feeds it. We’re delighted the BBC appears to continue to agree.“We wouldn’t usually discuss our plans for next week’s show this far in advance. But I reckon this story will probably come up. Do tune in. We’ll be on next Friday at 9 on BBC1. Probably. ”The source also claimed that someone from the BBC Editorial Policy Unit had attended the recording, but a spokesman from the corporation said that was not the case, although a lawyer had been there to check for issues such as defamation or contempt. - PA "},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

The Foreign Office and DFID need to work closely together but I think DFID has more than proved its worth both in driving aid effectiveness but also in increasing British clout.It’s been striking and good that an innovation of the Labour government has not been trashed by the Tories but has been continued.He also praised the appointment of Rory Stewart as international development secretary, particularly as he has experience of working in Afghanistan and Iraq as a soldier and in the department as a junior minister. It’s an exciting appointment, a welcome appointment and one which hopefully means that he’s not going to need a year or two to bed himself in, he said. Mr Miliband was talking to the  from Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where he was visiting staff responding to the Ebola epidemic currently raging in the North Kivu region of the country.The Ebola outbreak escalated in April, with 126 cases in a single weekHe said that he had concerns that the outbreak was not being brought under control and that a reset was needed.The latest figures from the DRC ministry of health show that as of May 9 there have been 1604 cases of Ebola, including 1074 deaths, since the outbreak was first declared in the North Kivu region of the country in August.Mr Miliband was unable to visit IRC staff at the heart of the response because of an upsurge in the violence in Butembo, one of the cities at the epicentre of the outbreak.On Wednesday armed men launched several attacks in the city, killing a policeman. In a counter-attack by government forces 10 of the assailants were killed and six were captured.Mr Miliband, who was UK foreign secretary between 2007 and 2010, said that it was time to rethink the response.“The current financing plan runs out in July and there’s no way this is going to be over in July,” he said.“Carrying on as we are is not going to sort this crisis out,” he added.Centres set ablaze | The violence hampering the Ebola responseHe said there needed to be better coordination between large multilateral organisations such as the World Health Organization and the various NGOs that were responding to the crisis.He added that responders had to work harder had to build trust among the communities affected by the disease.“The view among our own staff is that there is a lack of trust in the local community and that’s fuelling the insecurity that exists. We don’t have armed guards in our facilities because our experience is that’s not the way to engender the support or acceptance or trust of the community,” he said.There are more than 100 armed groups operating in the North Kivu region and the threat of violence has overshadowed the response - just last month a doctor in one of the Ebola treatment centres was killed, prompting health workers to stage a strike.Mr Miliband said that that it was “unprecedented” to fight an Ebola outbreak in what is essentially a conflict zoneHe added: “This is already the second largest Ebola outbreak in history, already 1000 people are dead but my takeaway is that this is a far more dangerous situation than the statistic of 1000 dead - appalling as it is - suggests.“There are good reasons to believe the disease is not under control. April saw the highest recorded number of cases - 406. Now we’re in month 10 the danger is it spikes and spreads,” he said.More than 111,000 people have been vaccinated against the disease in the affected area and earlier this week WHO announced that it would be expanding the pool of people eligible for vaccination. It also said it was considering the introduction of a second vaccine to those at lower risk of contracting the disease.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleDr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the epidemic was in a “truly frightening phase”.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security  Democratic Republic of CongoChina could switch off UK cars and household appliances under Huawei agreement, former government security adviser warnsComment: Theresa May has written the script for Nigel Farage’s Brexit PartyComment: No, Amber Rudd.

I never have any trust that I’ll get to see artistsperformers I love because of sites like yours and prices like these.Wyndham\u0027s Theatre has already warned they will not accept tickets bought through secondary sellers.In a statement, the venue said: Tickets for FLEABAG are only available from Delfont Mackintosh Theatres or Soho Theatre. Please be cautious buying tickets from any other outlet as they will become void and you may be refused entry to, or ejected from the theatre.Tickets for the sold-out BBC Proms, set to begin at the Royal Albert Hall in July, have also been advertised with inflated price tags on Viagogo.One was offered for sale for £194 -more than three times the face value of £56. After being alerted to the inflated prices last night, the BBC Proms said on its official Twitter feed: We condemn secondary selling \u0026amp work closely with @RoyalAlbertHall to do what we can to prevent it. It is an industry wide problem and parliamentary proceedings are underway to address this issue.Viagogo, founded in London in 2006, has become a dominant player in the online ticket sales industry by connecting sellers to potential buyers. MPs recently warned the public not to buy or sell tickets through the site until it fully complies with consumer law.Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, criticised the firm for misleading sales practices in a report in March.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also noted issues of concern about Viagogo\u0027s compliance with an order to tell users about the face value of tickets. Viagogo has previously said that it is complying and working with the CMA, and its customers had issues on less than 1 per cent of transactions.China could switch off UK cars and household appliances under Huawei agreement, former government security adviser warnsComment: Theresa May has written the script for Nigel Farage’s Brexit PartyComment: No, Amber Rudd.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”Mr Hughes admits that he and other members of the early Facebook team should have done more to ensure that the site couldn’t be abused to “change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders”.But he says that the only way to bring that power into check now might be for the government to intervene and break up Facebook. Recent attempts to constrain the power of the company do not go far enough, he wrote, and the only way to keep the domination of Facebook in check is to force it to stop having such a vast power over the internet.“We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,” the article reads. “Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American.”Specifically, Mr Hughes argues that the company should be separated into different companies. The US government could also revoke the 2012 acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp so that they will return to functioning independently, he writes.“The cost of breaking up Facebook would be next to zero for the government, and lots of people stand to gain economically,” he said. “A ban on short-term acquisitions would ensure that competitors, and the investors who take a bet on them, would have the space to flourish. Digital advertisers would suddenly have multiple companies vying for their dollars.”In calling for such an intervention, Mr Hughes adds to a growing a number of voices in US politics who have argued that the only way to limit Facebook’s power is to break it up. Politicians including senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren have called for more regulation on the social network, and has been joined by voices across the ideological spectrum, including Ted Cruz.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We think that that should happen in all our member states, but not any minimum wage: we are talking about 60 per cent of the average wage as a target, criteria for a European-wide system,” he said.France warns UK ‘repeated’ Brexit deadline delays not on offerUK’s Brexit chief negotiator ‘joked that he would want EU citizenship’Corbyn says new referendum could be ‘healing process’Mr Bullmann, a German social democrat, said he believed Brexit should be regarded as “a huge mistake for many generations” and “a disaster”.“If you go to the root causes of Brexit, you can see it in France, even in Germany: the growth of the right wing is directly connected with inequality,” he said, arguing that the scapegoating of migrants for falling standards of living was “a bloody lie”.Crucially, the minimum-wage plan also has the backing of French president Emmanuel Macron, who included a similar proposal in his manifesto to renew the EU unveiled in March this year. Jeremy Corbyn also suggested such a plan during the EU referendum in 2016, arguing that it would give British workers a “level playing field” across the continent. Labour on Saturday announced it would extend its policy\u0026nbspfor a £10 UK minimum wage to under-18s, arguing that the policy would be “nothing less than life-changing”.On Brexit, Mr Bullmann has long backed a Final Say referendum, arguing as early as last October that the British public “deserve to have a Final Say on their future”.He would not be drawn on Labour’s referendum policy, but said: “I’m not in a position to come forward with recommendations for an independent Labour Party, whose members I like ... but in my personal opinion, if you asked me as a citizen as the UK, I would insist on having a say now, because the politics is blocked in Westminster and obviously when people see the real price of a wrong decision they should be asked again.”He added: “Unlike the government in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn presented a match plan saying the customs union is the minimum we have to achieve, as well as the continuation of labour and social rights, and environmental law that we’ve achieved in the European Union. That is for me an understandable point: though I’ve never become a Brexiteer.”Mr Bullmann will becoming to London on Monday to launch the findings of the Independent Commission on Sustainable Equality at the London School of Economics.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An armed police officer greets members of the Muslim community in front of Al Noor mosque as they arrive for the iftar, the evening meal, in Christchurch, New Zealand.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think we\u0027re getting better organised all the time.Yet, as his polling numbers have slumped, other Democratic candidates have emerged as media favourites, such as Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who saw a surge in support last month.Although Mr O’Rourke rapid-fire approach to campaigning served him well in 2018, when\u0026nbsphe cut Mr Cruz’s 16-percentage-point lead to 2.6 points, there are concerns that it may not work in a national campaign.He\u0027s going to have to slow down a bit, said Sandy Sothman, the co-vice chairwoman of the Cass County Democrats who watched him speak at a sunny hillside park in Atlantic, Iowa.When he gets going and talks about so many things at once, it becomes a little like, \u0027Is he riffing or what?\u0027Beto O’Rourke promises not to take fossil fuel moneyBeto O\u0027Rourke compares climate change threat to Germany in WWIIStudent at Beto O\u0027Rourke rally fails to recognise him in bathroomBeto O’Rourke says immigration makes America safer at first 2020 rallyThe former congressman still insists on driving himself between events, sometimes to the disapproval of campaign staff, and has kept a busy schedule with multiple events a day.Nevertheless, some voters have been impressed by his hands-on approach.Marcia Fulton, a retired teacher and school administrator who met him at a restored train depot in Creston, Iowa, said she had not decided who she would vote for yet, but said Mr O’Rourke was really impressive, more so than I expected.\u0026nbspHe was prepared and that was a real question, given his youth, she added.Agencies contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He says he lost 15kg\u0026nbspbefore he was released.“I could have died at any stage of the process.”Mehdi Rajabian)After Amnesty International and musicians across the world intervened, Rajabian was released on bail\u0026nbspin late 2017, but still has a suspended prison sentence hanging over\u0026nbsphis head.His music could land him behind bars once again in one of the world’s most terrifying prisons, but he is determined to push ahead with his project – which was first dreamed up in jail.\u0026nbsp“War and human rights violations have always been a part of the Middle East,” he says.“I feel like music is a language which has no borders, and so we can unite different countries together and scream a message of peace.

Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight. Former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked from his post based on accusations from people unknown and “evidence” he’s not allowed to see.This Government is getting more like the Stasi with each passing day.EMMA THOMPSON has been branded a “first class hypocrite” after lecturing the rest of us on climate change then hopping on a commercial jet.Was she on a mercy mission to the socialist haven of Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis has resulted in violence and helpless families being wracked by poverty and death Nope, thought not. She was on her way to New York for business meetings.But hey, do as I say, not as I do. Isn’t that the luvvie way The surreptitiously taken photo of her in seat F was accompanied by exquisite detail of her Laurent-Perrier champagne and beef carpaccio consumption.And according to one report, her share of the carbon dioxide generated by the flight was “the same as that emitted by heating an average house for nine months”.While I could extrapolate for hourson climate change data and its possible outcomes and solutions, I instead find my attention drting towards the more compelling conundrum of . . . who nobbled Dame Emma at ,ft Given that the first-class compartment of the BA jet only seats , it has all the makings of an excellent TV mystery in which all the exits are sealed, Miss Marple comes on board, and the perpetrator is eventually unmasked.Except, in this case, they’d be a national hero.STRICTLY dancer Katya Jones has reportedly been demoted from having a celeb pairing in the next series because her snog with last year’s partner Seann Walsh was deemed “unprofessional” by BBC bosses. Yet there she is, currently strutting her stuff on the nation’s theatre stages as part of the brand’s offshoot tour called . . . Strictly Come Dancing: The Professionals.Go figure.DANIEL CRAIG’s hunky stuntman has been causing a few hot flushes among the nation’s menopausal women .Jean-Charles Rousseauhas been photographed on location in Jamaica, where filming has started on “Bond ”, as it’s currently known.He was driving a Land Rover, but quite how many other stunts he will perform on Mr Craig’s behalf remains to be seen.Meanwhile, it reminds me of the incorrigible Sir Roger Moore who, when I asked whether he used stuntmen during his time as Bond, replied: “Yes, but I did all my own love scenes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was Tories specically.Indeed the new fly-on-the-wall EU documentary is a revealing portrait of the pompous, sneering, undemocratic bureaucrats .million of us voted to leave: mocking Brexit, our country, even our “war spirit”. That’s right, the war spirit that served us well as we helped to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny.But for an insight into Verhofstadt’s blinkered stupidity look no further than a remark he made only yesterday.Turkey, he said, was “drting towards dictatorship” as its president orders the re-run of an election he lost.Precisely as Brussels does with its own defeats and is desperate to do with Brexit.WHAT is going through Theresa May’s mind  She cannot rescue this.Brexit deadlines come and go. More are set. Empty promises are made. They’ll be broken too.Her party and country are baying for her to step down. Her aides threaten legal action against her own MPs — as she tries to stitch up a deal with Corbyn neither his party nor hers will back.This utter shambles would be catastrophic enough for the Government without Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. But, as predicted, he is hoovering up Tory voters, members and maybe donors.This existential threat can only be fought under a new leader. Those closest to the PM should talk sense to her.WE reluctantly accept, as the Government has, that our High Streets need to be ­reinvented in the online shopping era.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire rightly says we cannot “turn the clock back”.Many stores cannot compete with the convenience and lower cost of buying on the web. If that means town and city centres becoming a mass of restaurants, hairdressers and nail bars combined with welcome new housing, well, so be it.But it’s rich for a Government to throw up its hands. It’s politicians, via obscene business rates and parking charges, who helped wreck stores’ ability to compete.How can ANY High Street business survive those Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And right across Europe it is the new populist parties which will hold the whip hand come May . Electors are furious about uncontrolled immigration, tired of the bureaucratic EU and sick to the back teeth of social liberalism.Like never before they are backing the populists, in countless countries across the continent. They already now run Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Estonia, having come from almost nothing ten years ago. But in these Euro elections the change will be even more dramatic.Across Scandinavia, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, more and more electors are deserting the centre parties for what the BBC, holding its nose between two fingers, likes to call the “far Right”.Largely nationalist parties which care about national sovereignty and do not care for immigration. Sometimes radical socialist parties which resent the bullying EU.The centrist liberals of the European People’s Party and the socialists are likely to be routed, a response to decades of mismanagement and arrogance. For the first time EVER they are unlikely to hold an overall majority.And the numbers of populists making headway will be swelled by our own generous contribution — because Nigel Farage is marching back to Brussels — and his Brexit Party will secure at least a few dozen seats on May . This is an enormous problem for the current, discredited, EU leadership.One Brussels panjan- drum said it would lead to “institutional paralysis” within the EU. My response to that is: How will we tell  But he is probably right.The new parties are opposed to everything the current administration stands for. They are Eurosceptics. They wish the EU to be a trading bloc, not a supranational government telling every country what to do.They are largely socially conservative. They have little truck with the identity politics of the liberals. And they hate uncontrolled immigration. This will lead to an enormous upheaval in Brussels.They’ve woken up and smelled the coffee. The liberals know that their cards have been marked. But what Europe faces is a year or two of wrangling as these new parties seek to exert influence over the EU.And it will be made worse by the fact that the European People’s Party is itself split over what to do about immigration. A good proportion of EPP members have woken up and smelled the coffee.It’s all a bit ironic, isn’t it  Three years ago we voted to leave the EU — for many of the reasons that have led to this surge for the populists on the European mainland.If the populists can gain control of some of the EU’s institutions, it might become a much more palatable organisation for British people.Ah well. But one thing is for sure. In the UK, in the US, in Brazil and in the EU, liberalism has had its day. Good riddance.SO – she’s called the kid Archie Harrison.  I’m like, wtf  It’s not very regal, is it Sounds like the name of a combative left back for Middlesbrough in about . “Oh and a very robust tackle from Harrison there, which has left Smith needing stitches and possibly a kidney transplant.”I knew Harry wouldn’t have a say in the matter. Arthur and James were among the favourites, but I had a cheeky bet on Jayden and Lee.Anyway, despite being only three days old, the kid has already performed a hugely valuable service to this country. He’s moved Prince Andrew down from seventh in line to the throne to eighth.HUGE respect to Liverpool for their astonishing comeback against Barcelona.A brilliant performance and it is always fun to see Lionel Messi sick as a parrot suffering from severe gastroenteritis and feather rot.That cheeky corner. I want to see Millwall try it next season, and maybe develop the idea so we can actually have two balls on the pitch at the same time.RACHEL Weisz had better watch out.  Her husband Daniel Craig is to star opposite Ana de Armas in the next Bond flick.The pouting Cuban-Spanish moppet, has a habit of falling for her co-stars. Or becoming romantically involved with them in a deeply meaningful way, whatever.Listen Rach,he comes home smelling strongly of tapas, sling him out. IT’S that extravagant campfest, the Eurovision Song Contest, next week.It’s being held in Tel Aviv, Israel. And for months the pro-Palestine lobby has been demanding the whole event be boycotted.  Luckily, nobody has paid them any attention.And no word from the liberals, of course, on the  rockets fired into Israel by Hamas. Can you imagine, by the way, what would happenthe song contest was held in Palestine  Or indeed in any hardline Islamic state Half of the performers, all of the audience and most of the presenters would be terried they’d be pushed off the top of large buildings.BRITONS aren’t getting enough, apparently. The number of people who have sex at least once a week is down to record low levels.The experts think this is because of stuff like Netflix. We’re too busy watching Emilia Clarke in Game Of Thrones to give the missus a bit of a seeing to.What we need to do, then, is make sure everyone in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Africa get signed up to Netflix sharpish.That’s where you’ll find the world’s highest birth rates.If we can stop them having sex, the global population might stop its inexorable rise.EATING nuts while you are pregnant can improve the intelligence of your baby, apparently.  That’s the result of a new study.Yeah  So how come squirrels are so thick The number of nuts those furry little b******s get through, they should be inventing the theory of relativity and blasting off to the moon.Instead of sitting like idiots in trees and running away from dogs.THE former BBC presenter Gavin Esler has demanded TV news programmes stop putting on pro-Brexit people. The arrogant public school berk says he’s sick of hearing from “so-called” experts who support leaving the EU.OK, Gav. So how about some economic news  The UK is set to out- strip the entire eurozone, with the economy grow- ing THREE TIMES faster than Germany in the next year. Who says this  The European Commission.THE end of the London Marathon. The poor stewards have been at it all day. Hours and hours have dragged by and they want to go home, but still the tail-end charlies are straggling in.And so I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is it not quite understandable,not entirely within the spirit of the event, for a tired steward to shout out, in exasperation, as a fairly hefty competitor gasps and wheezes down The Mall: “Run, fatboy, run!”Yes, there is to be an investigation after Jack Glenny, , was subjected to this injunction.  And worse, when he finished, to be told snippily that he should have started at am.Jack was once on Big Brother and, because he was running for charidee, believes that nobody anywhere should have an unkind word to say against him.

On his head would be a top hat with the slogan: “Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug.”He squandered a fortune in £ election deposits and seldom attracted more than a handful of votes, although in a  county council election he beat two Labour candidates. He called the result: “A Loony landslide.”His policies  To reduce immigration, he wanted vast photographs of Russell Brand and Katie Hopkins erected at British airports. These, he argued, would so terry new arrivals that they would leg it on the first plane home.People with stutters should receive  per cent discounts on their t-t-t-telephone bills. To combat obesity, superglue should be added to lip salves. And anyone convicted of homophobia should have to serve their sentence in drag.On the face of it, poor Toby, like his late pal and party leader Screaming Lord Sutch, seemed a crackpot. That was the conventional verdict.But the longer you look at them, the less loopy Lords Jug and Sutch start to look. Were they possibly not more sane than many of our “real” politicians It’s not asJug smashed mobile phones against the wall , shaved the back of his hands Peter Mandelson, or travelled by sledge to the Arctic Circle for a photoshoot with huskies vain nincompoop David Cameron.And Toby Jug certainly missed a trick by never granny-dancing on to a party conference stage to the strains of Abba. We had to wait for “dependable” dullard Theresa May to do that.Mrs May or Lord Toby Jug: Which was more deserving of being carted away by the men in white coats Which was closer to the public’s views  Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug. And that was a better slogan, was it not, than Mrs May’s daft, delusional  General Election claim that she was “strong and stable” She croaked it like a demented parrot. “Strong and stable” turned out to be as truthful as some fruitcake who marches along your high street claiming to be the King of Prussia.Our politicians love to pose as shrewd sentries outside the nation’s coffers. They boast about their cleverness and financial acumen and yet they propose blowing £billion — more likely £billion, say sceptics — on a swanky new railway line that may reduce journey times between London and Birmingham by just a few minutes. Few voters want the HS line yet MPs press on with it. Nuts.Mrs May, who is forever lecturing the poor about how our tight public finances bind her hands on necessary spending, gaily proposes giving the EU a £billion cheque for almost nothing in .Does the House of Commons pin her down and ask her what the blazes she is doing  Nope.Who is the bonkers one here  It wasn’t Jug who, hoping to look virtuous, told police to reduce stop and search, a decision which was followed by a dreadful rise in kne murders of black kids. That was another crazy policy of the turbulent, scowling, almost catatonic T May.If you meet MPs, as we politics reporters must, you will hear them say that our PM “has lost it” and “needs help”. These are not poor-taste jibes about mental health. They genuinely believe Mrs May is unwell. Yet they will not remove her from an office in which she has command of our Armed Forces. Who’s pottier here  Mrs May, or the MPs who indulge her Take a look at the  General Election manesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party. One of its policies was: “We will introduce votes at .” They clearly thought that was a comically absurd idea. Today it is national policy in Scotland and is supported for the rest of the country by the Labour Party.Another  Monster Raving Loony proposalwas: “Solving the problem of over-crowding in prisons by releasing all innocent prisoners.”Our political class has gone one better than this. It has sought to solve prison crowding by releasing GUILTY prisoners.Then there was the Loonies’ idea to give House of Lords seats to: “Anyone who writes a problem page in a national newspaper.” Daft, of course. Instead, Labour gave a peerage to minor TV personalityAlan Sugar.The last gem from the  Loonies’ manesto was a promise to hold: “A referendum on whether people want a referendum on Europe.”Good joke — except that it has come horribly true. We were told our  EU referendum was a “once-in-a-letime” chance to decide whether or not to stay in the EU.Many MPs now want to block that poll’s Leave result and say it was merely a rehearsal for another referendum.Nurse, we need more straitjackets here!RIP, Lord Toby Jug.

I love you but I want to die.”Shes one of several women who feature in a new Louis Theroux documentary, Mothers on the Edge, filmed at South London’s Bethlem Royal Hospital’s Mother and Baby Unit, which treats mothers experiencing serious mental illness whilst allowing them to live alongside their babiesIn the UK, around one in five new mums experience a mental health problem before their baby’s first birthday, many for the first time in their le. Postpartum psychosis is a severe mental illness which starts suddenly in the days or weeks after having a baby. Symptoms can change rapidly and include depression, confusion, hallucinations and delusions.For Catherine, feelings of depression and anxiety arrived straight away when the reality of being a new mum set in.The full extent of postpartum psychosis, which occurs in approximately one in , women with no prior history of mental health issues , is not commonly known.Treatment ranges from medication and cognitive behavioural therapy to, only rarely, electroconvulsive therapy.Bethlem Mother and Baby Unit’s lead psychiatrist Dr Trudi Seneviratne says pregnancy, childbirth and new motherhood create a perfect storm of discomfort, sleep deprivation and hormonal disruption.“It’s a high-risk period when it comes to suicide,” she says. “At the worst end of the spectrum you have a dead mother and a dead baby. It doesn’t get more awful than that.”Catherine has taken two overdoses since the birth of her son Jake – a son with whom she admits she can’t bond.“I don’t feel I can be his mum, he deserves better than me, someone should be looking after him that can love him,” she tells Louis.Catherine had terminated a pregnancy at  weeks a year earlier after a foetal diagnosis of Downs Syndrome. Traumatised by this loss and what she describes as ‘effectively a stillbirth’, Catherine felt she couldn’t cope when she became a mother.“There was a rush of love for the last baby and there wasn’t that feeling for Jake because there was always the feeling that something was going to go wrong like it did the last time,” she explains. If I am not that attached to him and something awful happens, then I feel I wont be hurt.“There’s huge guilt that I don’t feel the way I did for the last baby. I want to feel something for him. I want that rush of love and I want to feel the overwhelming urge to protect him. The feelings for him are completely dferent.Catherine also admits she doesn’t enjoy cuddling her son.“That makes me so sad, and it’s one of the main reasons I took an overdose to try to kill myself, she admits.Catherine was on unsupervised leave in the gardens at the mum and baby home when she escaped and went to a hotel room to overdose.She was found  hours later.I dont even know what happened, she says. I feel better now.Sometimes being a mum just feels so horribly overwhelming, she says.The responsibility of looking after this little human. Theres a weird mental block.I think that the love and connection is there, Louis says. I just think you struggle to feel it.The young mum is placed on a treatment plan which involves taking sedation medicine and therapy.Mother-of-three Lisa spent three and a half months in a mother and baby unit in Winchester following several psychotic episodes after the birth of her daughter Isabella - but is now back home with her family.“Everything was fine for a few months then suddenly, out of the blue, I felt overwhelmed by everything. I phoned my husband, Andy, who was at work, and asked him to come home,” says Lisa, who lives in Horsham, West Sussex.She was stressed and anxious, and saw her children as ‘complete hard work’.Andy says that after the birth of the couples third child, the decline in Lisa’s mental health was alarming. I was watching her personality disappear but didn’t know what to do about it, he says.Lisa explains: “It was asI’d had a total breakdown. I couldn’t speak, I didn’t wash for days, I didn’t get out of bed for two weeks, and I thought killer clowns were going to invade the house.”Despite a three-month stint in a specialist unit which saw her make a partial recovery, Lisa says shes still not back to normal.“I want to wake up and feel not scared of everything. Time’s creeping on and I’m still bonkers. This is really crap,” she says. “My biggest fear is that I won’t be good enough for my family.”While there is no time scale, Lisa has been reassured that she should make a full recovery.Like Lisa, Catherine eventually s home to her family after being discharged from hospital following more treatment and new antidepressants.“Things are absolutely fantastic now. I can say I love my baby, she says.Louis Theroux says: “Postpartum mental illness, like many aspects of mental health, is all too common and not acknowledged enough. The sad fact is, for many mums, their experience of having a baby is traumatic and they don’t experience Hallmark Card feelings of love.Louis Theroux: Mothers On The Edge, BBC, Sunday May , at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s offered to come and meet with the executive, and it would be strange for that not to result in a clear understanding at the end of the meeting.“We have asked a question. She’s coming, I assume, to answer it.”The latest thinking in Downing Street – revealed by James Forsyth in his Sun column today – would see Mrs May give the grandees a far smaller concession.Under the plan, the PM would pledge to the executive to resign as party leader as soon as her Brexit deal is passed, triggering a long summer leadership contest.After MPs whittle down the array of candidates to a final two, they would then tour the country to meet members for weeks.That may look the tallest of tall orders.But civil service preparations have made huge strides.

It is not a personality-based issue, it is an evidence-based issue.“We have to move forward on the basis of knowing that we’re not going to see the kind of damage done on the island of Ireland that the imposition of a border would result in.”Brexiteers hate the Irish backstop, enshrined in the Withdrawal Agreement, as it could keep the UK tied to the EU for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think they’re be looking to chose someone for the long term.”But quizzed on whether he would be prepared to be the next permanent Tory leader, Mr Brady would only say he is busy at the moment running the troubled  Committee.He added cryptically: “It would take an awful lot of people to persuade me.“I’m not sure many people are straining at the leash at the moment to take on what is an extraordinarily dficult situation.”If he does run, Sir Graham would join an already hugely packed field.More than a dozen senior Tories have already thrown their hat into the ring to succeed Mrs May publicly or in private.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, of course, she was with the prince by her daughter’s side when she gave birth.Normally the Queen is the first person to know of a new royal arrival, but this time Doria pipped her to the post.It is the first time a photo has shown the non-royal grandparent watching the Queen meet a new member of “The Firm” for the first time. And in another break with tradition, Doria was given a special mention when Buckingham Palace officially announced the baby’s birth on Monday.This suggests Doria, , will have a big role to play in Archie’s le and as a rock-like presence for Meghan.The Queen, like her grandson Harry, has a special affinity with Africa, both having spent extended periods on the continent during their twenties. She will likely appreciate the important role maternal grandmothers play in families with African heritage.Doria is an African-American grandmother who has raised a young woman of mixed heritage to be confident, strong and independent in the US, a country still coming to terms with its complicated racial history.The fact that Archie has such a erse family, from free-spirited yoga teacher Doria, right through to the Queen, will help him navigate the path in front of him. The baby ushered in an offshoot of our Royal Family that represents modern Britain where people of mixed race or dual heritage are the fastest-growing ethnic group.Archie bridges three continents: Europe, America and Africa, and the ability to help dferent groups of people find common ground will be really important in our future.By embracing change and adapting to the modern age, our Royal Family continues to occupy a place in the nation’s hearts.Archie will grow to be a young man familiar with the challenges we face in learning to live with dference, and he will be raised by people — such as Doria — who have done this successfully. In an interview, Doria’s stepmother, retired teacher Ava Burrows, said: “I’d assume she is going to be a hands-on grandmother. Historically in our culture, the mother worked long hours and needed support with her kids.“Grandmas usually live close together with the rest of the family, playing a big part raising their grandkids.“Doria is very important to Meghan. She’ll be a wonderful grandmother.”Doria was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in September . When she was a baby, her father Alvin, an antiques dealer, uprooted the family to Calornia. Soon after they settled in LA, Doria’s parents orced.Her father married Ava. He died after he tripped and hit his head on a kerb in .Doria was raised by her mother Jeanette, a shorthand typist. After leaving school Doria worked as a travel agent and later started a business selling clothes she made herself.In her early s she trained as a make-up artist and landed a job on the set of a TV soap, where she met and fell in love with Meghan’s dad Thomas, who she married.They orced when Meghan was six and Doria later worked as an air stewardess.Doria’s pet name for Meghan was “flower” and the pair shared a powerful bond.Describing her mum on her former blog The Tig, Meghan wrote: “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free Spirit. Lover of potato chips and lemon tarts.“Andthe DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat.”She also wrote about how Doria imposed strict curfews when she was a teenager, taught her to cook Cajun shrimp gumbo and took her jogging and bike-riding.Perhaps Meghan will hope her mother will repeat all these activities with Archie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Burgon denied saying any of it, only for footage to turn up revealing he did. But the Shadow Justice Secretary insists his denials weren’t lies.

The US again blamed Hezbollah for the incident.The Clinton White House, in , placed a total embargo on Iran meaning US companies could not trade with the country.And in , George W Bush included the Islamic Republic in his famous “Axis of evil” speech along with North Korea and Iraq.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.According to the deal, Iran would receive relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.However,  on May , , President Trump announced the US will withdraw from the agreement -

In Barking, houseboats along the River Roding collect just behind Barking Abbey and although from the outside they might look a little rusty, once inside you can see why those living there might be on to something.Boasting affordable housing and a friendly community, the river collective stick together, says Wendy Judd, one -year-old houseboat owner, My London reports.She said: It really is a community. We have parties with each other, outdoor barbecues, they do festivals, we have a lot of fun.    Wendy and her husband only paid £, for their houseboat, but have carried out major renovations since they moved in. She explained: We bought this about two or three years ago. The man selling had a stroke while we were negotiating so we got a very good deal. One of the other boat owners helped us do the water tank and stuff. With only £ a month running costs, plus a charge for the London Port Authoritylicence and mooring, houseboats present a temptingly cheap alternative.Wendy and her husband run their laptop repair business from the comfort of their floating home rather than splashing out on their office in London Bridge.I lived in London for  years and I didnapost even know my neighbours, we only spoke when we were dropping off Amazon parcels, she said.  The houseboat community in Barking has a WhatsApp group chat to get around the issue of the lack of doorbells, and they even have a shared bird garden. Wendy said: We all have a part for the moorhens and the swans. The swans laid some eggs up the river but they were swept away, it was a shame. The community is hugely erse, with some who have been on the river for decades. But getting the chance to buy a boat is extremely rare. There are a lot of people in the art business, creative types - sculpters, painters, Wendy added. The boats themselves are as equally erse, from classic longboats with engines to boats the size of a yacht. Wendy said: Compared to others, our boat, called Billy Buoy, isnapost even that big. Thereaposs a huge one with six bedrooms and a sauna!  Some people move up and down the river but we donapost - we donapost have an engine. Wendy added: I love everything here, they are all so friendly and nice. Another houseboat owner, Cat Hart, explained why getting on to her boat at the moment is more tricky than usual. She said, due to building work in the area the riverboats have been displaced and lost some of their mooring land, so currently there are two or three boats moored alongside each other.The jewellery designer moved from Chiswick to the neighbourhood five years ago.The -year-old said: I always wanted to live on a boat and I got lucky. Everyone is so great, itaposs a lovely community. Thataposs whataposs kept me here, itaposs the people who have made me stay here so long.  I get to live on my own but without the loneliness. Her houseboat is very dferent from Wendyaposs - more traditional, with the addition of Cataposs jewelleraposs workshop in the back corner. Cat said: I have done quite a lot of work on the boat, built a lot of things for it. When things go wrong I have to fix them. Buying a riverboat costs a fraction of the price of a house in London, with Wendy able to buy a spacious boat for only £,. The running costs are also tiny compared to the costs of owning a house - on land in Barking and Dagenham the norm is to pay over £, a month for a mortgage and bills.    Compared to a riverboat:Only some people who live on riverboats pay council tax, andthey do itaposs Band AThe London Port Authority charges £ per linear metre per year for mooring Moorings licences are paid to the landowner and y according to boatand the popularity of the area A small boat between . and . metres currently costs around £. a year to moor* A larger boat between . and . metres currently costs around £. a year to moor* Access to water is included in the mooring fee Electricity and gas costs the same as in any house, but many houseboat owners do not use electricity so these are minimal Many also heat their home by burning wood or coal rather than using a gas fire Youaposll also need a Boat Safety Scheme certicate, starting at £ for four years Other occasional costs are similar to running a house, but also include repainting, hull scraping and nishing "},{"url":null,"title":"labour pilot universal basic income","story":"NewsLabour to pilot Universal Basic Income scheme for EVERYONE - rich or poorEXCLUSIVE: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has revealed the Labour Party will trial UBI in Liverpool and Sheffield when it takes powerShareCommentsByKeir MudieSophie Drew:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJohn McDonnell \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn McDonnell has revealed a Labour Government will trial universal ­basic income. Cities earmarked for pilot schemes include Liverpool and Sheffield, the shadow chancellor said. UBI means every citizen receives a fixed sum, usually enough money to live on, whether they are rich or poor, in work or unemployed. The radical-sounding idea has been tried in countries ­including Kenya and Finland and even in parts of the US. And the shadow chancellor was this week handed a feasibility report for its application in Britain.Under Labour , pilot ­projects would give everyone in designated areas a certain amount of cash every week – ­regardless of their income.   They can spend it how they like. But the intention is for it to be used to study, set up a business or leave work to care for a loved one.  Mr McDonnell said: “I’d like to see a Northern and Midlands town in the pilot so we have a spread. “I would like Liverpool – of course I would, I’m a Scouser. “But Sheffield have really worked hard. I’ve been involved in their ­anti-poverty campaign and they’ve done a lot round the real living wage. “I think those two cities would be ideal and somewhere in the Midlands.” Dferent universal basic income models could be tested in low-income areas, including one in which a whole ­community gets basic incomes. All the means-tested benefits – apart from housing benefit – would be taken away and every adult would pocket, for example, £ per week. They would also get an additional £ for each child they have.    Mr McDonnell said: “Of course it’s a radical idea. But I can remember, when I was at the trade unions ­campaigning for child benefit. “And that’s almost like UBI. You get a universal amount of money just based on having a child. UBI shares that ­concept. It’s about winning the ­argument and getting the design right.” Universal basic income is a hot ­debating topic for ­economists and philosophers and has fans and critics both on the left and on the right. The concept has been around since at least the s and was mentioned in the  US ­presidential election. A UBI scheme called the Manitoba Basic Income Experiment was ­introduced in Winnipeg in . A similar fund was set up in Alaska in , letting every citizen benefit from royalties from the oil industry. It began paying all state residents in  and the scheme is still running. By  the UBI fund was worth  per cent of Alaska’s GDP and yielded an annualof  per cent. The largest pilot launched to date is running in Kenya and is funded and implemented by the non-profit ­organisation GiveDirectly. It provides a basic income for , villagers and will be monitored for the next  years. Finland intended to pilot a similar trial in  but was unable to apply the cash to every community and ­resident. Instead the government handed a basic monthly income of £ to , ­unemployed for almost two years. The primary aim of the scheme was to promote employment but as data is still being evaluated it is ­impossible to sayit worked.    In the UK, charity Citizen’s Income Trust has been ­encouraging debate for  years. Some critics fear that UBI would be too expensive. John Kay, former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “If you do the numbers, either the basic income is ­unrealistically low or the tax rate to finance it is unacceptably high. End of story.” But Mr McDonnell is ­convinced of the benefits. He said: “Ed Miliband is really keen we commit to a couple of pilots in the manesto but we will have to argue that out. We want to do it in areas that have been hit hard by austerity. “The reason we’re doing it is ­because the social security system has ­collapsed. We need a radical ­alternative and we’re going to examine that. “We’ll look at options, run the pilots and seewe can roll it out. “If you look at the Finland pilot it says it didn’t do much in terms of ­employment but did in terms of ­wellbeing – things like health. It was quite remarkable. “And the other thing it did was ­increase trust in politicians, which can’t be a bad thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror labour ready provide","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: Labour is ready to provide leadershipTories arentThe country is crying out for leadership from somewhere - and Labour is ready and willing to provide itShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionJohn McDonnell \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories like to give the impression that Brexit talks with Labour are going rather well.But in an exclusive interview with the Sunday Mirror, John McDonnell paints a very dferent picture. The shadow Chancellor says ministers fall out with one another in front of the Labour team. Which is a funny way to negotiate. And with the Government visibly ­disintegrating, Mr McDonnell says it’s hard to have confidence in the talks producing an enduring result. He puts his finger on the problem which faces the whole nation. The country is sailing in a rudderless ship of state whose crew might chuck the skipper overboard at any moment.    We hope these talks succeed. We hope Brexit will be sorted out once and for all. But like the shadow Chancellor, we are sceptical. And because Brexit occupies every Tory waking moment, there is a vacuum of ideas needed to solve the nation’s ills. Not so with Labour. Mr McDonnell is keen to give Universal Basic Income a try. So is this newspaper. It may not be the answer to our complex and chaotic benefits system, but we’ll never find out unless we have the courage to give it a go. Rejuvenating our high streets will be a Labour priority. And it can come none too soon. Wait much longer and there will be little left to resurrect. Jeremy Corbyn yesterday promised under-s a living wage of £ an hour.

She had some happy memories of her early childhood, although chaotic, before she was taken into care aged five. Ellie asked her adoptive parents what had happened to her mother but they were reluctant to tell her. Instead they promised that she and her two younger sisters would find out when they were older. Eventually Ellie discovered the truth for herself when she was  by going online and googling her birth mother’s name – Paula Clennell.    Up popped a YouTube documentary about the hunt for Suffolk strangler Steve Wright in . At first Ellie did not understand what was going on. But she was stunned as the programme revealed a terrible story – that her mum was the serial killer’s fth victim. “I will never forget that moment,” said Ellie, speaking of the trauma for the first time. “It was so hard to watch.” She also learnt for the first time that her mother had been a prostitute, which led her to become a victim of Wright. The documentary showed Ellie’s mum being interviewed on ITV news just days before he murdered her aged . In it Paula was asked about the danger she and other sex workers in Ipswich faced while the strangler was still at large. Paula replied that she was worried about getting into punters’ cars but would carry on doing it because she needed to earn the money.    “I couldn’t speak when I saw my mum being interviewed,” said Ellie. “There was my mum on the screen. I remembered her voice and she even looked and sounded like me. “It made me so angry that people were speaking to her about the danger she was in and she still wasn’t helped. “She may have been a prostitute, and she may have done drugs but she was still a wonderful woman.” Wright’s victims also included Ellie’s godmother Annette Nicholls, . Now , Ellie remembers growing up in an unsettled household with her two younger sisters,  and . She looked after them and ­remembers strange men coming to the house. It was something she ­understood the meaning of only after seeing the documentary. Ellie recalled: “It was a hectic childhood but my mum was so nice. She cared for us all on her own and whenever she saw us upset she would give us sweets or chocolate.” Ellie’s happiest memory of her mother is sitting under the stairs on beanbags with Paula while munching through a packet of rainbow cereal. It was a ritual they carried out every night as they chatted after her sisters had gone to bed. When Paula could not look after her young children they would go and stay with her sister Alice Bradshaw.  But it was not enough to keep the family together. And when Ellie was five, she and her sisters were taken away by social services. “I remember being driven away in a car,” said Ellie. “Mum didn’t come to say goodbye because it was too painful but auntie Alice cried as we were taken away. “We didn’t know what was going on. We just thought we were being taken home, not being adopted. “It wasn’t mum’s fault we were taken away. She was just so young.” They spent a year in foster care before the three sisters were adopted by a couple in their s, in Lowestoft, Suffolk, who both had steady jobs. Ellie recalls happy years spent with her sisters, and going on holidays to France and Centre Parcs with her family. But Ellie was determined to find out more about her past and asked her adoptive parents about her mother every day. “I never forgot my mum,” she said. “I called my adoptive dad “Dad” ­because we always had a good ­relationship and I’d never had a father figure before. But I couldn’t call his we “Mum”. I already had one. “I would always ask my ­adoptive parents about her but they always shut me down, telling me, ‘You’ll know when you’re older. We can’t talk about it. Your sisters are too young.’    “I asked about her every day. It was the first thing I did each morning. Each time they didn’t tell me, I kicked off. I wasn’t the best behaved child.” Aged  Ellie took matters into her own hands and found the documentary online during an IT lesson at St Felix School in Reydon. “Everyone was talking about their parents and someone asked about my mum,” recalled Ellie. “I looked up my mum’s name on YouTube and up comes this documentary. “I watched it over and over again and it made me so angry. “How could I not find out about any of it until I was , despite me asking my adoptive parents every day what had happened to her  “It was comforting to watch her but, at the same time, ­crushing to know I’d never see or talk to my mum again.” Ellie was bullied by her school friends after sharing her shocking discovery with them, and she spiralled into depression. She eventually ran away from her adoptive home but was found a few days later, and moved into ­another foster home. At  she became pregnant with twins and had to give them up for adoption. Ellie said: “My biggest fear has ­always been following the same path as my mum. “But I couldn’t see a way out.    “Then auntie Alice messaged me and invited me to stay with her while I got back on my feet.” Alice helped Ellie get a job in a chip shop and the pair would sit up all night and talk about Paula. “She told me about what my mum was like when she was a kid, and about how Steven Wright smiled at her in court,” said Ellie, who now lives in Lowestoft. Although it was dficult hearing about mum, being with auntie Alice again helped me find closure in a small way. “No one had ever been as loving and kind as Alice was to me before. “Being with her has also made me feel closer to Mum in a way.” But the comfort of speaking to her aunt, who she no longer lives although they are still close, has done nothing to stem her anger towards Wright, , who is serving le in jail. Ellie said: “He took my mum away from me and ruined any chance of me seeing her again. “I hope he rots in prison.” "},{"url":null,"title":"champions league final day wedding","story":"NewsChampions League final day wedding ides Spurs and Liverpool supporting coupleAbby Norman, a die-hard Liverpool fan, is set to marry avid Tottenham fan James Alexander on June ShareCommentsByShannon Hards:,  MAY NewsAbby Norman and James Alexander will tie the knot on the day their teams meet in the Champions League final \"Get the biggest Liverpool FC stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA soon-to-marry couple are facing a huge wedding day conflict - because their favourite football teams will meet in the Champions League final that day. Bride-to-be Abby Norman, a die-hard Liverpool fan, is set to marry avid Tottenham fan James Alexander on June .And she says she fully expects to be upstaged by the big game between the teams, Plymouth Live reports .The mum-of-two from Plymouth says thereaposs no question that she would be watching the game on the day. The only problem was that her venue, Polhawn Fort, is in a rural area on top of a clf - with limited signal. The -year-old said: When we found out the Champions League Final was on our wedding day we were disappointed we would miss it. But once I knew Liverpool were playing there’s no way I’m not going to watch.   I did make a joke on Facebook thatLiverpool don’t win there might be an annulment on the cards.She continued: The way Tottenham were playing during their last game, I thought that was it and they weren’t going to get to the final anyway. But they came back and scored in the final minutes. We are all in shock to be honest. Loads of guests have been calling and texting to ask whether we will be watching the game andthe venue will have enough signal. So I’m going up there to check that we can play it in advance. We have to watch that game – there’s no way we are going to miss it.    The management told me that the signal isn’t fantastic sowe don’t give anyone the WiFi password we should be ok – so I will be banning people from using the internet. Abby and James have two children, Jude, who is eight and Dolly, two. She continued: James and I met through friends on a night out. He proposed in November  on my birthday. We have this thing werewe’ve had an argument we go for a coffee and walk on Plymouth Hoe. So after my birthday meal we went for a coffee and he got down on one knee. We booked the venue two or three months later and didn’t think about the final despite being big football fans. Askedshe was worried about having an empty dance floor during the game, Abby said: No because I won’t be on it – I’ll be watching the game myself.    She continued: Luckily we are having the same guests to the evening so new people won’t be arriving that I’ll have to mingle with. Organising the wedding has been stressful. The most stressful thing has been organising the men. I left it quite late because I thought it would be easy but getting them to the fitting and putting them together has been a nightmare. Some of them haven’t picked up their suits and they’ve only got a few days before they can’t be altered any longer. I am glad I don’t have to do it again. Speaking about her team, Abby added: To be honest it wasn’t an option not to be a Liverpool fan because my dad is a huge fan. I was bought up having to support them. For as long as I can remember we’ve been watching the football on the TV. I don’t think there’s ever been such a big rivalry between me and my partner – not that I can remember. Football fever is set to take over the wedding with a number of Champions League final themed aspects to the day. As my wedding favours I have bought Cancer Research charity badges, all the men have football ones. Also for the ceremony, instead of having family seating sides I’m having Liverpool side and Tottenham side, said Abby. People pick a team to sit with, on each chair is a free drink ticket with the club name on, whoever wins the Champions League can take their winning ticket to the bar to claim a free drink. Will be interested how many people pick Spurs and how many pick the better team, Liverpool. We have ordered flags and scarfs for during the match so people can pick a team to support. We will also be running a score sweepstake. It’s going to be so much fun.

The actress plays Daenerys Targaryen in the smash-hit show and says the dragon-rearing warrior princess is so ingrained in her psyche she even dreams about being her. Emilia, , said: “This has been such an engaging journey that I sometimes would wake up at three in the morning from some deep dream and would still be living the character. I don’t think I will ever cut Dany’s spirit off completely.” The Oxford-born actress recently revealed she survived two le-threatening brain aneurysms in  and , which led to her suffering anxiety and panic attacks.  But she drew on the strength of her Game of Thrones character – who grows from a frightened young girl into a fierce queen with three fire-eating sidekicks over eight series – to help her through the tough times. She said: “You can’t help but find yourself swept up by the sense of determination she has shown and how she’s fought back against so many enemies and grown stronger “My spirit has been so enriched by her strength of purpose and survival instincts. “Even though I have experienced some dficult challenges, when you see what other people in le and what my character endures – and yet still finds the will to carry on – you feel a similar drive and fearlessness.  “You stop worrying over nonsense and focus on the truly important things in le.” Emilia was just  when she won the part of the heir to the Targaryen dynasty. She said: “We were two helpless girls at the beginning of things. Dany transformed into a warrior, forced to confront the most extreme limits imaginable and, in my own way, I have pushed my own limits and faced up to my own insecurities in order to defeat them.” In one memorable Game of Thrones scene, Daenerys stripped off and walked through a fire. But far from being embarrassed about shooting it, Emilia is proud. She said: “It was just a wonderful, strong moment I wanted to own, a real empowering, girl-power wow scene. I was so thrilled with it. It’s not a sexy scene – she’s not naked for no reason, it’s not gratuitous. “She’s naked because she has just destroyed her enemies in this almighty blaze after they underestimated her. She played her trump card – how could I say no  “All I needed was vodka, some flattering lighting and I was ready!” The very last episode of Game of Thrones is due to air on Sky Atlantic and HBO next weekend and Emilia admits she broke down in tears as filming wound down.  “I cried like a baby towards the end...Ten years is a long time. It’s like losing a limb. “I grew up with the character. You go through a period where you feel heartbroken that you won’t be coming back to that world and to all the wonderful cast and crew members who became your family. “But then you snap out of that nostalgia and sentimentality and start thinking about all the exciting things that lie ahead. “So I’m thrilled about the future.

A spokesman for Jame Masjid Mosque opposite the girl’s school said: “Her family sent her off to school in the morning expecting to hear about her amazing day at Drayton Manor but the unthinkable happened.” The young girl’s death has shaken the community and they are all devastated. “Obviously our thoughts are with the family after this heart breaking news,” the spokesman said. “When anyone dies it’s a tragedy but when it’s a child as young as she was it’s just awful.” He said all that can be done now is to pray for her family and hold them in their thoughts. The spokesman added: “It will be a painful wait to hear about exactly what happened following a police investigation because at the moment all we know is she fell, not how or why.”  Visitors told how they heard crying and screaming coming from the main entrance of the ride. Graham Johnstone, , said earlier: The first I knew something was wrong when I saw staff running over to the ride and turn people away. Minutes later an air ambulance appeared overhead. All you could hear was crying coming from the steps leading to the ride entrance. It was awful. The emergency services were on the scene so quickly. I saw the air ambulance land but it didnapost take off again. I just hope the kid was ok.  Eyewitness Matt Mason, , said: I was on Splash Canyon just before the person who fell in. Didnapost see it happen but was collecting my family photo when a lady came up to the collection booth to say that a girl had fallen in. She was pretty calm so we assumed it was nothing major. Shortly afterwards, police, fire and ambulances arrived and the ride and whole area was closed. No one seemed panicked over an hour later when we left. Mum Fiona Fletcher, , from Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, was at the park with her two young daughters. She said she heard a car come charging through clearing the path and then paramedics flew past.  My kids and I had just got off the carousel ride and all we could hear were sirens. It really scared my daughters, she told. The entrance to the Splash Canyon was probably a few hundred yards from where I was standing and there was clearly a huge commotion. I saw six fire engines, at least five police cars, four ambulances and two paramedic cars and an air ambulance. They put metal barriers up around the whole area so no one could get in. She said it was a quiet day and that there were only a few hundred people in the park, and that as staff began ushering people away, many were confused. When she saw an ambulance charge out of the barriers with sirens blaring she realised she had to leave.  Superintendent Carl Ratclfe, of Staffordshire Police, previously said: We were called at .pm this afternoon to reports that a child had fallen from a water ride at Drayton Manor Park. The girl, believed to be -years-old from the Leicester area, has been airlted to Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital. Her parents have been informed and are being supported by officers. The HSE have been informed of the incident.WERE YOU AT THE THEME PARK TODAY  CALL    OR EMAIL WEBNEWS@TRINITYMIRROR.COM A police spokesperson later added: We can confirm the patient was on a school trip. A teacher must have either been inside the ride or in close proximity but that will be a matter for the HSE to investigate. The Health and Safety Executive tweeted: HSE has been made aware of todayaposs incident at #draytonmanor and making initial inquiries along with emergency services. Drayton Manor said the ride was closed after the incident and staff assisted emergency services.  A spokesman for Drayton Manor said: The Splash Canyon ride has been closed following an incident this afternoon.Emergency services are at the scene and our fully trained park staff are assisting. Ambulance crews were called to the park at .pm. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: West Midlands Ambulance Service can confirm it was called to reports of a patient in the water at Drayton Manor Park, Tamworth, at .pm this afternoon.  An ambulance, a senior paramedic officer, a paramedic area support officer, a rapid response paramedic, a community first responder and the Midlands Air Ambulance from Staffordshire were sent to the scene.

According to royal expert Marlene Koenig, even second-in-line to the throne Prince William and we Kate Middleton donapost legally have full custody of their three children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. This is because the family has an agreement with the Queen, which means she is granted full legal custody over all minor royals. Koenig further explained the rule to the Sun Online. She said: The sovereign has legal custody of the minor grandchildren.    Legislation passed during the reign of George I. It was known as The Grand Opinion for the Prerogative Concerning the Royal Family and it was about the King’s control over the education, the raising and the marriage of his grandchildren. He did it because he had a very poor relationship with his son, the future King George II, so they had this law passed that meant the King wasof his grandchildren. The law dates back more than  years to , a time when the monarchaposs right of supervision extended to his grandchildren and this right of right belongs to His Majesty, King of the Realm, even during their father’s letime. The Queen also had full custody of William and Harry when they were younger.This fact first came to light when Prince Charles and Princess Diana got orced in .   In the coupleaposs orce agreement there was no mention of custody arrangements for the children, despite arrangements being made. This was because neither parent had full custody, instead this belonged to the Queen. This meant Charles and Diana had to get the Queenaposs permission before doing simple things with their children, such as going on holiday. Koenig confirmed that the rule still exists today and technically the parents need the Queenaposs permission to take their children out of the country. She added that despite this, the Queen is respectful of the wishes of the parents and wouldnapost push her views upon them.

After enjoying two days of privacy at Frogmore Cottage following the birth of Archie on Monday morning, the couple revealed him to the media on Wednesday afternoon. The new parents decided for a limited number of press to be in Windsor Castle for the photocall and video - with an interview performed by the Press Association.But one of the broadcasters was CBS which is said to have made parts of the British press aposfuriousapos.  CBSaposs flagship morning show This Morning is hosted by Gayle King who is a best friend of Meghan and even attended her baby shower in New York. There have been claims the inclusion of CBS was to aposreflect the international interest in the storyapos of Baby Sussex. An industry-wide embargo on the footage was lted at .pm on Wednesday - which would have been .am in New York.    But the idea the photocall was timed for US TV has been denied. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “The birth of The Duke and Duchess’ son was publicly announced on Monday, and The Duke was pleased to speak to the media on the same day. Their Royal Highnesses were delighted to introduce their new son to the world on Wednesday scheduled around introducing him to his great-grandparents for the first time. The Duke and Duchess took the personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.” In a statement to The Sun the palace said: The photo call at , with embargo of , was timed to fit around the timing of the Sussex’s visit to Windsor Castle to introduce their son to his great grandparents.  The Daily Mail claims that British broadcasters were furious with the choice of CBS - and that there are concerns the decision will be seen as a aposslap in the faceapos to Commonwealth broadcasters, particularly in countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The paper quoted a source who said: It’s a decision that has taken everyone by surprise and has not gone down well in some quarters. Last month Harry and Meghanaposs office announced they would be keeping details of the birth private.

But what she got inwas a deluge of insults about her body from online trolls. As a dress size -, she is well below average size for a British woman. Yet she was treated like a pariah by vicious keyboard warriors. Now ahead of Mental Health Awareness Week she asks:they could make a -year old woman feel so awful, what are online trolls doing to our kids As a shoolgirl I was bullied for my liquorice thin legs.Even my dad would teasingly ask meI was a good whistler… because I had legs like a budgie. Fast forward  years and two kids later, and being “too skinny” is no longer a consideration. But neither do I think I have a weight problem. So after writing about Victoria Beckham’s fashion line for last week’s Sunday Mirror, I was stunned to be mercilessly hammered on social media for being “fat”. As a dress size  to , I am well below the average size for a British woman. Yet I was treated like a pariah by vicious keyboard haters.    I had squeezed into Victoria’s new collection to prove the clothes were ill-suited to most women.But Facebook trolls told me I had lied about my size, that I was too big to fit the designer numbers and that I looked like a T-Rex.To be honest, after looking at the photo of me trying to hold up the shoulders of a red VB dress, that dinosaur comment was probably fair game. But other FB users obsessed about my dress size. Dozens of comments poked and prodded at my figure. No way was I a size  below and a  on top. I must be at least a “huuuugee”. And why on earth was a woman my shape daring to try on VB clothes  Even men got in on the act . I have a wardrobe full of size  and  outfits from favourite shops like Next, Wallis and Mint Velvet. And, let’s face it, Victoria’s designs would make a skinny s model look shapely. So do I care about these jibes  Absolutely I do. But not for the reasons you’d think.    I’m . I don’t wear a bikini on holiday and I’m very accepting of the fact my figure has changed over the years – I have two beautul boys to show for it. But after a few hours of trolling I started to feel pretty bad about the way I look. A couple of days later I was Googling diets. So on the eve of Mental Health Awareness Week, I was wondering,they could make me feel so awful, what are online trolls doing to our children and vulnerable people in general  I was curious to see who was behind the most barbed comments. A quick check of Facebook profiles followed and, sorry ladies , butI was the type to dole out advice on appearance, I’d have a field day. The dference is, I’m not that type. Instead, I thought about the impact this kind of hate would have on a teenager – someone at that vulnerable stage, forging an opinion about who they are. I also thought about how devastating it must be to be trolled by people meant to be your friends.  If you don’t believe I’m being truthful about my size, then believe these facts instead. Around  per cent of young people self-harm. You go ahead, troll, make them cut deeper. One in eight children has been bullied online. Glib comment worth it, troll  A quarter of kids have seen hate or racist comm-ents. Seriously  I have no words. You could argue that as a journalist I deserve all I get. Fair enough, I’ll take it on the chin. Yet the same people who criticise the press think it’s fine to invade a stranger’s privacy and make comments about how they look. Total hypocrisy. Kids still learning the basics of human interaction see grown-ups getting a kick out of taking cheap shots at strangers. We should be teaching them it’s who they are that is important, not how they look or how much they weigh.Facebook, Twitter , Instagram and the like try to regulate the monster they have created, but it is out of control.So here’s a suggestion, Mr and Mrs Troll: If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all. And try to be happy with your own circumstances instead of looking at the lives of others for your inspiration.

Kerry Armstrong crouched over her newborn daughter to protect her as husband Gary Peoples punched the mother-of-two in the face and kicked her in the head, leaving her with severe bruising and swelling.The play group leader, from East Belfast, says she can never forgive the printer worker and is relieved to see him behind bars, Belfast Live reports.In court, -year-old Peoples admitted assaulting his we, as well as his step-daughter in the same incident on October  . After her husband was jailed for  months by Judge Elizabeth McCaffrey at the Crown Court in Derry, Ms Armstrong said she was glad the judicial system had worked for her.    She encouraged anyone who was in a domestic violence situation to report it immediately to the authorities. A barrister for the Public Prosecution Service told Judge McCaffrey that three days after the birth of their daughter, Ms Armstrong and Peoples had an argument in the bedroom of their flat. Peoples punched her on the face and after she fell to the floor he then kicked her to the head. Seconds before the attack Ms Armstrong had her newborn baby daughter in her arms. She crouched over the baby in order to protect her during the assault. When her -year-old daughter came into the bedroom, Peoples grabbed her and pushed her up against the wall. The prosecutor said Peoples initially prevented his we from leaving their home but she eventually got out of the front door and drove to her mother’s home from where her brother reported the assaults to the police. Peoples was arrested but made a ‘no comment’ interview. The barrister said there were several aggravating factors in the case.    She said Ms Armstrong was vulnerable having just given birth three days earlier and she should have felt safe in her family home. A defence barrister said People accepted it was a terrible way for him to have behaved towards his we so soon after she’d given birth to their daughter. She added he was genuinely shameful and remorseful and has not seen his daughter, who is now  months old, since the incident. The barrister said although there was no previous domestic violence history between the couple, their relationship was a dficult one. He added: “There was a very short romance before the marriage. Both parties brought their own children from previous relationships to the table. “It was the meshing of two families which raised issues about relationships between the respective children and step children. “Tensions were at times running high and the defendant bottled things up. He did not deal with things appropriately and he snapped. “It was an out of character incident and one he will have to live with for the rest of his le.”    Judge McCaffrey said the contents of the victim impact statements made by Kerry and her daughter showed how much the assaults have effected them. She described People’s actions as abhorrent and said society utterly rejected such offences. Judge McCaffrey added: “The message must go out that people who commit such crimes will receive condign punishment.” Speaking after her husband was jailed Ms Armstrong said she felt relieved that the episode was now over. She added: “I am glad that the judicial system has worked for me in this case. “It has been quite a long time since this happened and it has been hard to get to this point. “At times I just wanted to give up but I was determined to go through with it on behalf of other women who have suffered and who are still suffering from the effects of domestic violence. I want to thank in particular Women’s Aid in Belfast. Without their help and counselling and without the help of other domestic violence sufferers whom I have met and befriended I couldn’t have gone through with it. “They gave me amazingly fantastic assistance. Until this happened to me I didn’t really appreciate the extent of the levels of domestic violence in Northern Ireland. “Now I know and the women whom I now know who have been victims and who have come through it make me feel so humble.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stem cell donor who saved","story":"NewsStem cell donor who saved me is my best pal and I could watch daughter marryEXCLUSIVE: After two years of sharing ­anonymous letters Nicky Turkoz finally got to meet Annette Hamson – and the pair formed an unbreakable bondShareCommentsByMatthew Barbour:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsNicky Turkoz and Annette Hamson are firm friends \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen single mum Nicky Turkoz was ­diagnosed with leukaemia, her ­biggest fear was not ­living to see her children get married. But thanks to a kind stranger’s le-saving stem cell donation, she got to give away daughter Meltem on her big day. Now that donor is no longer a stranger. Because after two years of sharing ­anonymous letters with her, Nicky finally got to meet Annette Hamson – and the pair formed an unbreakable bond. As Meltem, , tied the knot, Nicky’s new “soul sister” was a guest of honour. Nicky, , said: “Without Annette, I simply wouldn’t have been alive. The gt she has given our family to enjoy this day together is simply priceless.”  Annette, , added: “We are like twins. I didn’t think I was doing anything special when I signed up to the register and then donated my stem cells. But seeing the massive grin on my ‘twin’s’ face on Meltem’s wedding day brought it home.” In September , Nicky had begun to struggle walking up the stairs at home in Bournemouth. Her youngest daughter Zeynep, then , had just moved to Gran Canaria to be a holiday rep while Meltem, then , was about to move out with her partner Francis. “I’d been a single mum for  years and just thought I was suffering from empty nest syndrome,” Nicky said. By December, her breathlessness was worse so her GP arranged blood tests.  Later that day the GP called to say she had to go to hospital that night – and pack an overnight bag. Meltem drove Nicky to Bournemouth Hospital, where more blood samples were tested. They quickly realised this was not simple anaemia. Nicky recalled: “The consultant said I had acute ­myeloid leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells, and would need to start chemo straight away. I was shocked.” Meltem called Zeynep with the awful news and she got the first flight home. Nicky’s first round of chemo finished on January , . After her second round, on February , the doctors said she would need a transplant of stem cells – a basic type of cell that can change into another, more specialised, type of cell. She said: “Tests showed I had a high risk of relapse eventhe chemo did work.  “BasicallyI wanted to make sure I was around to see my daughters get ­married and have children, we had to find a matching donor.” During her final chemo round, the transplant team at charity Antony Nolan started hunting for a match. “I had no concept then how important it was to find that match,” Nicky said. “Since then, I’ve lost several friends from the ward who couldn’t find a suitable donor.” By the start of April, three possible matches had been found. Nicky said: “I’d lost all my hair, I felt rotten and knew while this was good news, I was far from out of the woods. “There was no ­guarantee my body would accept the donor cells.” Following a chemo course to kill off white blood cells in her bone marrow, Nicky got the stem cells via an IV line on May . Seh said: “I lay in bed staring at that bag of blood cells as it went into me, thinking some selfless angel out there had given me this chance for a future.”  Still not knowingthe treatment had worked, Nicky and her girls sent the anonymous donor a note of thanks through Anthony Nolan. Nicky said: “We knew the anonymity ruling meant we wouldn’t have a chance of meeting for two years but we felt compelled to let him or her know how grateful we were for this potential second chance.” With her immune ­system low, Nicky had to spend the next  months as isolated as possible to avoid bugs, relying on her daughters. Within a few weeks, Nicky got a card back from her donor. And that sparked regular exchanges between them until the two-year contact block ended in May . Week by week, Nicky grew fitter and stronger, with tests showing the match seemed to have worked. As things were looking up, Francis proposed to Meltem. Nicky said: “I was like a kid at Christmas, counting days to that second ­anniversary, desperate to thank that donor.”  Finally allowed to swap contact details, the meeting happened in September , at a Wetherspoons pub in Poole, Dorset. Mum-of-four Annette said it was only when she met Nicky and her girls that she really understood what she had done. She said: “Nicky hugged me for what felt like an eternity. I had to literally prise her off so we could sit down.” Annette, who went to the pub with her husband Andre, soon realised the intense bond between Nicky and her daughters. Healthcare worker Annette joined Anthony Nolan’s register in , when a pal of her eldest son Daniel was hit by ­leukaemia. It was not until December , shortly after her dad died, that she was told she might be a stem cell match for someone in need. She said: “Losing dad made me realise how precious le is. That email felt like destiny, a way of making the world a ­better place when I’d been so low. The regular thank-you cards from Nicky and her daughters were lovely. They made me ­realise how special Nicky was.” The two families talked in that pub for five hours, until closing time. Annette said: “We both bought each other a bottle of prosecco. It was like we were twins, we had the same thoughts, the same likes and dislikes. “Both of us knew from that day we’d be best friends for le.” The two women talk or text every day. On Christmas Day the families Facetime at pm to raise a glass of prosecco. Annette adds: “Every month or so I go to Bournemouth or Nicky comes up to us in Northampton. “We both feel we’ve got a new family now and every day is a ­blessing.

Earlier this week Rianne Ward said she was distraught when she tried the product, believing that she had betrayed her religion by consuming pork. The healthcare assistant planned to make her and her son a pasta dish with a jar of Cucina creamy lasagne sauce, reports Derbyshire Live. But the -year-old said the sauce - labelled vegetarian - smelled odd and believed it may have been aposcontaminatedapos. She lodged a formal complaint. Aldi have insisted the sauce is suitable for those who do not eat meat.    Now staff at Derbyshire Live have put the claims to the test purchasing the sauce in question as well as a carbonara sauce, to seeher accusations held up. Reporter Chris Harper, who broke the original story, went first. He knew it smelled like bacon when he spoke to Miss Ward, but didnapost taste it when he interviewed her. As the sauce touched his tongue, his mouth was filled with a taste of smoky bacon. It was a similar taste to Walkers Smoky Bacon crisps - which are also suitable for vegetarians.    Despite having the texture of baby food, he said he would definitely buy thishe was going to make a lasagne or create another pasta dish. Next was the carbonara sauce which had very visible bits of meat inside it. According to the jar, the bits were pieces of ham. The sauce was very peppery to the point where you couldn’t really taste much . There was a slight taste of cheese but it was overridden by the pepper. It reminded him of Heinz Chicken Soup. Reporter Nick Reid was next up and noted the aposveggieapos sauce had a very thick and gloopy consistency.    He said that the sauce immediately had a strong taste of bacon, smoky bacon in fact, and its heavy texture also gave it a sharp aftertaste and bacon flavour remained throughout. Next was the carbonara sauce, which he said had a distinct flavour similar to that of the lasagne sauce. He noted the consistency was more like chicken soup and also had a strong hint of pepper running through it. Other reporters noted the lasagne sauce’s “strong bacon flavour” and smell while Tom Bokros said the carbonara tasted like frankfurter. Eddie Bisknell enjoyed the lasagne sauce and noted how it tasted much more like bacon than the carbonara sauce. The website says that the reporters enjoyed the taste of the sauce and would buy it in the future and understood Miss Wardaposs worries and accusations. A spokesperson from Aldi said: “We are sorry to hear Miss Ward is unhappy with this product and can reassure her the lasagne sauce is completely meat free. The product is flavoured with smoked salt which gives it its distinctive taste.” "},{"url":null,"title":"windsor homes fit royalty sale","story":"NewsWindsor homes fit for royalty on sale near Meghan and Harrys Frogmore CottageArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windors birth date - Monday May  - was the busiest day on Rightmove so far this year for house searches in WindsorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsThis home is on Kings Road in Windsor, Berkshire \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailProspective home buyers desperately tried to find properties near Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs Frogmore Cottage on the day their son was born.Archie Harrisonaposs birth date, Monday May , was the busiest day on Rightmove so far this year for searches in Windsor.Some of the available properties would place you among the royal couple’s closest neighbours, and you might even shop at the same supermarket.

Areil Duncan, , met her beau, Steven, , on a dating website and initially thought the turf equipment technician was too old for her but they hit it off a few weeks later. After first meeting in December , the couple became official on New Yearaposs Eve and were engaged just a week later. They were married in May  and have since built a le together - and are soon hoping to try for children.    However, during their two-year relationship the couple have received abuse on a daily basis in the form of judgemental glares, people askingthey are kidding when revealing their connection and even mistaking Steven for Areilaposs dad. Now the couple, from Pennsylvania, US, are sharing their story in hope that it will break the stigma behind age gap relationships. Areil, a teacher, said: I initially wasnapost looking for an age gap relationship as, even though Steven looked good for his age, he was too old for me. But we eventually hit it off and have been together ever since - we are married and hope to spend the rest of our lives together, alongside hopefully trying for children soon.    However, since being together, we have continually received comments about our relationship - we can tell that being together makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable. We get a lot of stares - some are angry, some confused, some curious - and we often get comments about our age dference. Weaposve had people saying that Steve is old enough to be my father, people askingweaposre aposkiddingapos about our relationship and that they didnapost think we would last. But we try to ignore it, weaposre both adults so age does not really matter.  What is important is having great conversations, having similar morals, le goals and real love - which is what we have. Despite having been together for almost three years, Areil admits that she was first put off by the age dference. We met online on a dating site - he messaged me first, so we exchanged greetings and he asked me what I thought about him, she said. I told him that he looked good for his age, but that we could only be friends and that he was a bit older than what I was looking for.    He told me we could be friends, that was not his intention, but we continued messaging all the same. On a day I was very down, he insisted I speak with him on the phone so I did and we had a long engaging conversation and by the end I felt a million times better. We met a few weeks later in person and have been together since. After meeting face-to-face in December, Steve quickly proposed weeks later in January  and, after marrying in May that year, the couple have been settled ever since. They are now looking forward to trying for children soon and hope that they can diminish any stigma behind their relationship ahead of growing their family.  Areil said: We want people to realise that as long as you are both consenting adults, there is no reason that age should matter. We are happy and we hope that when we do one day have children, they will not have to hear the comments that we do. We have true love and that is all that matters - age is just a number and the stigma behind these sorts of relationships needs to be destroyed.

Tanya Ricardo, , from Houston, Texas, USA, spent over a decade waiting for her ‘womanly’ body to aposdevelopapos. Throughout her le she was taunted over her body shape and told to ‘eat a cheeseburger’ or ‘cake’, as well as others assuming she had an eating disorder. The years of abuse led her to long to change her appearance and last month she finally went under the kne.Using her royal idol Meghan Markle as a guide, she longed to emulate her curves and further their resemblance.   She had liposuction to transfer fat to her buttocks, fat grafts to her cheeks, lipo under the cheeks and chin, breast augmentation from a c-cup to a d-cup, lip fillers and other injectable treatments. Now in recovery after six hours of surgery, she’s delighted with her transformation so far and can’t wait to flaunt her new curvy physique at the beach. Tanya, a land technician, said: “I have always been a very skinny girl, so I never really felt like I was a woman and surgery has been on my mind. “People have teased me for my whole le, even to this day, they say things like ‘eat a cheeseburger’ or they accuse me of having an eating disorder. “This wasn’t and has never been the case, I eat and I love food. “I hoped from the surgeries I would appear a lot more like how I wanted to look, which is a grown woman.  “I didn’t know when my adult, woman’s body was going to decide to show up. “Everyone just told me to wait and it would catch up with me, but I turned  and it still hadn’t ‘caught up’. “It’s something I have been waiting for years, but being a single-mom, my priority was my son so I wasn’t thinking about myself. “Now I’m ecstatic, I can’t wait to be able to hit the gym with extra weight in the right places and then I’ll be good to marry another Prince. She continued: “I do think I look more like Meghan Markle, I see it in the shape of my face. “We have always resembled each other, we both have dark hair, big brown eyes and a structured fine nose. But now that I had had a couple of surgeries on my face it accentuates her look on me even more. “Meghan not only has a great sense of style, she is very classy, sexy and sophisticated all in one.  “When people say they see the resemblance, which for me makes me feel like it was mission accomplished.” Growing-up Tanya always thought uncomfortable with her body, not buying fitted jeans for years after the years of insults and unfair comments. Then after giving birth to son Gavin, now five, she was left with baby fat on her stomach and her breast size dropped from a full to a small c-cup after breastfeeding. Tanya said: “I was extremely self-conscious with what I wore, I didn’t like showing my legs – I just wasn’t happy with what I saw in the mirror. “My bottom half, so my butt and thighs didn’t really exist, I looked very young and didn’t have the curves I wanted. “People would tell me I was beautul and to be thankful for being slender, but all of the negative comments overrode all the good things I heard about myself.”    But since undergoing the surgeries on April , Tanya has felt more confident and hopes to dispel her self-doubt by continuing to empower herself. Tanya said: “I feel like a dferent person and happy, hopefully the negative comments will stop and won’t affect me. “They transferred some of the extra baby fat in my stomach from pregnancy into my butt. “I never had a butt before, I felt like I never had curves when I was young so it’s great. “I’ve not fully healed so haven’t seen myself full but my face and top half is great, I can’t wait to show it off at the beach. “My family were concerned initially because they always thought I was beautul, but after seeing what a wonderful job Dr. Rose did they are happy too.” Tanya had work with Utopia Plastic Surgery  Med Spa, who have seen a spike in those seeking to look like the new-royal Meghan.  Dr. Franklin Rose said: “Many women want Meghan Markle nose and cheeks, she has quite an attractive face and pretty body. “Meghan Markle is so much in the mainstream with this baby, she’s probably number one even above Kim Kardashian-West. “Tanya started really pretty, it’s a lot easier to take a patient from A to C, than A to Q, all she needed was refining. “With this patient, she is much more confident after we changed her body image for the better.” Now overwhelmed with her appearance so far and more surprises to come, as it will take six months for her to fully heal – Tanya can’t wait to embark on a career change. She added: “My biggest dream is to become a model and actress, which is another way that we are alike. “I’m going to pursue those dreams now, I’ve modelled before but was never confident in how I looked so hopefully this will help. “Confidence is an extreme factor in the modelling world and I know it will help me push myself to my limits.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy asks epic dinosaur birthday","story":"NewsBoy asks for epic dinosaur birthday cake that moves - and dad totally nails itWhen his son requested a birthday cake to top all birthday cakes, comedian Hamish Blake accepted the challengeShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video dad-shares-hilarious-process-creating-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email For his birthday, five-year-old Sonny Blake asked his father for a dinosaur cake.But not just any old dinosaur cake.

His father, Australian comedian Hamish Blake, agreed to produce such a cake and set about figuring out how on earth he was going to complete the challenge.   Documenting his progress on Instagram , Blake began by making a rough sketch of a dinosaur.He then sent the sketch to Ryan McNaught, the resident expert on the reality show, Lego Masters.And Ryan came through, building a motorised dinosaur out of Lego bricks.It was brilliant - but somehow it still had to be turned into a cake without ruining the mechanisms.    Blakeaposs followers then watched as the -year-old attempted to stick pieces of chocolate cake to the structure, without much success. He then decided to work with a dferent substance, smothering the lego with Rice Krispies and melted marshmallow. As a compromise he also baked a volcano out of cake, so that his son would still have an actual cake to eat on his big day. The dad then took a break from cake making to share an important realisation heaposd come to. He said: This cake is a bit like parenting, sometimes you just sit back and look at everything that needs doing and then treat yourself to a drink instead.    Eventually he managed to cover the entire frame in the Rice Krispie mixture and was delighted to find the tail still moved.The next step involved coating the whole thing in icing and adding the all important touches to really make it look like a dinosaur - including teeth and claws.After six long hours, Blake finally revealed the finished product to everyone watching along at home, saying: We bloody did it!

Kayla Robertson wanted to find the best way to show the world how much she loves her pooch Penny, whom she got more than a year ago. The -year-old from Perth, Australia, said she decided that a small tattoo would be the most beautul way to celebrate her adoration for her gorgeous -month-old Australian Shepherd. And during a relaxing holiday in Bali, Indonesia, the medical receptionist thought it would be the perfect time to finally get inked.    After taking a recent photograph of Penny into a tattoo parlour located in the tourist hub of Kuta on April , Kayla forked out one million Rupiahto get a tattoo on her right forearm. But after less than thirty minutes under the needle, Kayla said she was aposshockedapos after the tattoo artist suddenly said they were finished- despite her feeling that the piece was only aposhalf-doneapos. Wanting to take some time to look at her new tattoo properly in the hope that she might get used to it, Kayla left the parlour without saying anything. But after showing her friends her new ink, Kayla was left mortied after she realised her precious poochaposs nose seemed to resemble aposmale genitaliaapos.    She said: I went to Bali for a wedding, and I wanted to get a tattoo while I was there. I knew I wanted to get one of my dog Penny, so I bought a photo of her with me. He did the outline of her face perfectly, so I was feeling good about it. But then he started doing the eyes and they looked all wrong. I saw that the nose looked weird and a bit crooked, but I couldnapost really tell what is actually looked like at that point because it was upside down on my arm. Then I noticed he wasnapost adding any shading or doing anything more to it. But I just thought, well he is the artist and he knows best.    But suddenly he just finished, and it looked half-done. I didnapost know what to say, I was in shock. I thought it might just take some time, but after looking at it properly I knew I hated it. Then I realised that Pennyaposs nose looked like male genitals, and then my friends all started telling me the same thing. They started laughing about it, I can see the funny side of it now but at the time I was crying and panicking. Poor Penny. It was just awful. I felt like I was in one of those tattoo nightmares shows.    In a desperate bid to fix the tattoo, Kayla appealed for help online and was pointed in the direction of a dferent tattoo studio which had lots of good reviews. And after forking out another one million Rupiah , Kayla breathed a sigh of relief after her beloved pooch Penny aposactually looked like a dogapos - and no longer resembled aposmale genitaliaapos. She said: I knew I couldnapost leave Bali with this tattoo on my arm. It was just hideous. I sought advice online for a good tattoo studio and was recommending another one nearby. I visited them, and they couldnapost believe what they were seeing. But thankfully, they were able to fix it.    It was amazing seeing them transform this hideous tattoo into something I actually love. I was so relived, and even gave the tattoo artist a big hug when he was finished. My dog is my entire world, so I was so happy to have a tattoo that actually looks like her. You really need to do research before getting a tattoo in Bali. Itaposs good to find an inidual artist that you love instead of the studio. It will make for a hilarious story when people ask about my tattoo. Iaposm really happy with it now.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby youngsters lead oban to victory","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowYoung Mid Argyll rugby players Drew Buckley, Anya Gritten and Amber Russell took part in the Glasgow Warriors championship with their Oban U Girls team mates on Wednesday February .The girls won all four of their games, scoring a remarkable  tries and conceding only two.They also played in the first round of the Scottish Cup in Oban against East Kilbride on Sunday February , progressing to the next round after an  impressive - points victory.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

Within its first year, Holyrood repealed the reviled Section  law, which effectively prohibited any positive discussion of homosexuality in schools. The move was not without resistance, but it was an early, positive sign that the Scottish Parliament was going to do its own thing and speak with a dferent voice.As for the countrys two great public services ndash health and education ndash the picture is mixed. Compare the pressures on the Scottish NHS ten years ago with the pressures on it now and it is clear there is a deepening crisis. Many teachers would use the same words about schools ndash indeed, this newspaper reports today that nearly half of Scottish teachers have seen a medical professional in the last year as a result of the strain of their job ndash and certainly it is in schools and hospitals that some of the deepest disappointment with Scottish governments has been felt. Nigel Smith, who spearheaded the push for devolution  years ago, told The Herald this week it was in these big areas of health and education that he felt most disappointment with the Parliament and it is hard to dispute his assessment: six out of ten at best.One way to improve the situation would be for the parliament to rediscover its radical voice or at least a robust system for testing legislation. One of the lessons of the debacle of the Offensive Behaviour of Football Act ndash which almost no one liked and which failed to work ndash is that a government with tight control over its backbenchers, coupled to a committee system that has an in-built majority for the governing party, does not always lead to good and coherent legislation. It might be useful to remember that the parliament was specically set up to be multi-party and pluralistic and the tight discipline of the SNP has not always been good for it.The current dominance of the SNP is also a reflection of the way politics has changed in the last  years. When the parliament was established, Labourrsquos pre-eminence in Scotland looked as strong as ever but its decline has coincided with independence becoming the central preoccupation of Scottish political le.Has this dominance of independence been good for the parliament  Not always, particularly when issues such as the crisis in the NHS become a proxy for the debate between nationalists and unionists. The constitutional debate has also led to friction between Holyrood and Westminster that does not always reflect reality. This week, the First Minister warned that devolution was under threat from what she called creeping centralisation by the UK Government, but the reality is that successive governments in London have respected the conventions of devolution and expanded them.If some agreement is to be found, it is in the fact that devolution as a process has been a success. The foundation of the parliament  years ago was the most signicant development in our political history since  and, while its development since then has been imperfect, it has allowed Scottish governments to try to find distinctly Scottish answers to Scottish questions. That, along with the th anniversary, is a cause for celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-do-not-allow-scotlands-gem-of-natural-beauty-to-become-a-theme-park","story":"Last month updated plans for a poundm leisure development at the southern gateway to Loch Lomond at Balloch were re-presented to Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority. The development is being backed by Scottish Enterprise but alarms are being raised at the process by which the land was bought and the bewildering nexus of business and political lsquorelationshipsrsquo that have paved the way for it to happen. In  Scottish Enterprise announced that the preferred bidder to develop the site was Flamingo Land, an outfit which runs a theme park and zoo in North Yorkshire. Both Flamingo Land and its partners at Scottish Enterprise insist that their plans are sensitive to the fragile beauty and eco-structure of Loch Lomond, perhaps the most globally-recognised representation of Scotlandrsquos natural beauty.: Scotland must be at lsquovanguardrsquo of fight against ecological catastropheThe national agency, together with Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park authority and other supporters of the development have iously described this verdant expanse as lsquoderelictrsquo and thus crying out for a themed and manufactured facility such as this. But you just have to walk around the perimeter of the area that has been marked for development to appreciate the huge scale of what is being proposed. This water and the land around it has been formed over millions of years by fire and ice into something sacred in its beauty. Now, part of its essential character is to be transformed and bent into unnatural shapes by a theme park. Places such as Ben Lomond, Balmaha, Inveraray and Balquhidder could be joined by a neighbour which calls itself Flamingo Land.The Loch Lomond plans include something called an lsquoaparthotel with  bedrooms. The space earmarked for this large facility suggests that it will come to dominate the shore and the surrounding terrain. There will also be a lsquobudgetrsquo facility as well as a development of self-catering units and six private houses valued at around pound, each. It will involve the wholesale destruction of the woodland that presently sits there and severely restrict access to a space that was gted to the public by a th century royal charter. The destruction of wildle, including red squirrels, otters and bats as well as myriad forms of insects is almost cheerfully assumed in the development proposal and justied by a pledge to lsquore-locatersquo some of these wee beasts. This project is as appropriate as hanging a giant gold medallion around the neck of the sphynx.The land was purchased more than eight years ago for the trling sum of pound, by Scottish Enterprise. Conveniently, there is no mention of the profits that will be realised for the developers once this public space becomes private. Scottish Enterprise and Flamingo Land say that it will provide budget holidays for families at the lower end of the economic scale. Once, this place, described as ldquothe lungs of Glasgow by the great Scottish walker and naturalist, Tom Weir, could be visited on day trips by the working class families of Glasgow who were unable to afford week-long holiday packages. Nothing in Scotlandrsquos immediate economic forecasts suggests that disadvantaged families will be flocking to this contrived woodland experience.The failure of Scotlandrsquos main political parties and the Scottish Government to scrutinise this development more closely or to answer questions about what laughably passed for a consultation process has been curious. Itrsquos been left to the Scottish Greens and the MSP Ross Greer to step into the breach. Thus far he has collected and lodged more than , objections, the largest petition of this nature in Scottish civic history. This week Mr Greer poured scorn at the optimistic job estimates imagined by the developers. ldquoWe were promised  jobs, then we found out that most of them would be part time and seasonal, then wersquore told  and now wersquore told itrsquos . Andwe read the small print in the application we see that over three in four of these jobs would be created anywayFlamingo Land doesnrsquot go ahead.:Scotland leading the way on meeting climate change targetsIn recent years many of Scotlandrsquos most hallowed and wild spaces have been subject to the predations of global billionaires seeking beautul places to annexe for their tinselly portfolios. In Sutherland and Aberdeenshire Donald Trump and one of his business rivals are succeeding in turning triple-A protected stretches of the north-east coast into golf playgrounds. Most grievously of all, an exclusive housing development at the war graves of Culloden battlefield is soon to proceed. Scotlandrsquos flimsy attempts at land reform have been rendered ridiculous by this grotesque Bargain Hunt taking place underneath our noses.Yesterday and last week there were families walking along the loch-side pathway amidst open spaces for picnics. I counted at least  people, including dog-walkers and a group of young American women, strolling amidst the tress. A stretch of unspoiled parkland bounded by Drumkinnon woods is often used by local schools for their sports days. This is a vibrant place, loved by the public.This dramatic pennant of public land doesnrsquot belong to any one organisation or inidual. How can anyone claim ownership of this land and these hills and this water that nature gted to the people of Scotland and to the animals who live and take shelter in it  It can never be Scottish Enterprisersquos to own and parcel up then hawk around interested buyers for a knock-down price. This so-called agency of the Scottish Government has been tasked with stimulating economic development and creating jobs, not to act like an offshoot of Arthur Daley Inc by participating in the privatisation of land enjoyed by the public for centuries."},{"url":null,"title":"change-uk-writes-letter-to-bbc-chief-over-have-i-got-news-for-you-cancellation","story":"The new political party said it hadraised concerns with the broadcaster over the fairness of its coverage of Change UK during the European elections campaign period.In a letter to BBC director general Lord Hall, it also called on the BBC to ldquoreview your decision to bar our party from theBBC Wales election candidatesrsquo debate, to be broadcast on Sunday.Important the BBC give a fair chance for full range of parties to be heard ndash my letter to the BBC Director General asking they overturn their bar on #ChangeUK taking part in tomorrowrsquos BBC Wales candidatesrsquo debate  explain their #HIGNFY decision pic gDxQOVqiJpmdash Chris LeslieMay , Change UKrsquos campaign co-ordinator Chris Lesliealso called for a ldquofull explanation of the BBCrsquos last-minute decision to pullepisode of Have I Got News For You,which featuredits interim leader Heidi Allen on the .The BBC One comedy quiz show tweeted shortly before the pre-recorded programme was due to air that it had been withdrawn.:Latest episode of Have I Got News For You pulled by BBCThe BBC referred to its editorial guidelines following the announcement that the episode of the  show, with Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, would be broadcast at a later date.It came after Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had been a list on BBC Question Time on Thursday.Announcing the letter, Mr Leslie said: ldquoBritainrsquos politics is broken andwersquore going to fix it, people need a chance to hear from the full range of parties standing in the upcoming European elections ndash including Change UK with our support for a Peoplersquos Vote and remain.ldquoThe BBC has a crucial role as our national broadcaster, butwersquore worried that over the past week, itrsquos got a couple of big calls wrong.ldquoThis is particularly concerning given that similar decision about Nigel Faragersquos appearances over the years appear to have gone the other way.ldquoToday, wersquore asking the BBC to look again and make sure itrsquos not doing British voters a disservice by giving some parties more favourable treatment than others.The letter states: ldquoI am writing urgently and in light of recent events for the BBC to provide a fair and balanced approach towards Change UK in its coverage ahead of the rd May European Parliamentary elections.ldquoAs the campaign co-ordinator for Change UK, I am specically asking that you urgently review your decision to bar our party from the BBC Wales election candidatesrsquo debate, due to take place tomorrowmorning.ldquoFor your BBC Wales team to exclude Change UK in particular hellip is deeply unfair and will limit debate rather than allow it.It adds: ldquoYour decision last night ndash within an hour or so of scheduled broadcast ndash to pull the screening of Have I Got News For You featuring our interim leader Heidi Allen has also raised serious concerns.The letter states: ldquoThe decision to withdraw this programme from air is all the more bizarre given the BBCrsquos decision to allow Nigel Farage to participate in an edition of Have I Got News For You on th April  ahead of the May  European Parliamentary elections.It claims: ldquoAlthough Heidi is not a candidate in the European elections, I do hope that the BBC will allow her voice to be heard and those of other Change UK candidates and representatives ndash and not continue to favour Mr Nigel Farage in your coverage, who is not only a party leader but a candidate himself.ldquoI urge you to ensure a fair approach is taken throughout this election period so that reasonable voices from the centre ground of British politics can also be heard in your coverage.Sorry everyone.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new date comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Speaking yesterday, Mr McArthur said: “It is hugely frustrating that talks between the union and HIAL have broken down again. Agreement between both sides seems as far away as ever.“While any disruption to our leline services is a concern, I am alarmed that the proposed strike date clashes with the start of the Orkney Folk Festival.#This is an absolutely key event in the Orkney calendar, with performers and visitors flying in from all over the country and beyond. If all flights are cancelled, this will inevitably impact on the success of the festival.“I have been in touch with the unions, HIAL and Scottish Ministers over the course of today, urging all sides to do what they can to avoid this damaging action taking place. A resolution to the dispute is long overdue, but the priority at this stage would be to find an alternative date for any strike action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new day comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Prospect had previously called off a day’s strike on April  to allow the company to develop new proposals. As no new offer has been made and with no further talks scheduled the union has said an offer is not likely to be tabled.Notably, the new strike date is also the first day of the Orkney Folk Festival, which welcomes acts and visitors to the county from all over the world.David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Members have run out of patience with HIAL. Talks have been ongoing for more than a year to seek to resolve this dispute but to no avail. Prospect agreed to withdraw our strike action in April to allow further talks to take place and members trusted that HIAL would use that time to bring forward proposals to resolve the dispute — HIAL have abused that trust.“Members do not want to take industrial action but have been left with no choice.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

In the same area, the move to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol is genuinely world-leading.Meanwhile, new laws on equal marriage have shown that the parliament is capable of both keeping pace with and leading public opinion as society’s attitudes to family and social issues evolve.Scotland has been on a democratic journey for the last two decades. It is a journey which I fervently hope – and believe – will see our country become independent.That is not a view shared by all in our parliament or in the country as a whole, and I sincerely respect those dferences of opinion.Recognising and reflecting those dferences, the Scottish Government has recently proposed the establishment of a citizens’ assembly initiative similar to that which has been used successfully in Ireland in recent years.A citizens’ assembly will not be a competitor or rival to Holyrood – rather, it will complement the work of the parliament and allow the wider public the opportunity to consider the kind of country we are seeking to build.: Scottish Parliament at : Why devolution failed to ‘kill nationalism stone dead’When I was first involved in politics, in the late s and through the early and mid-s, there was a widespread consensus that the status quo was not an option. The view was that there was a profound democratic deficit which could only be addressed with the establishment of the parliament whose anniversary we are now marking.Twenty years on, there is again a growing consensus that the current situation cannot endure. This time it is a post-Brexit landscape in which our Parliament faces the prospect of having its influence diminished for the first time since , and in which even some of the most ardent unionist voices would agree that the current status quo is not an option.Scotland’s relationship with Europe has been enhanced and deepened by Holyrood over the last  years, with our laws, including environmental and employment protections, entwined and aligned with those of our European neighbours. But now we face the prospect of being taken out of the EU against the overwhelming wishes of the Scottish electorate.The weeks and months ahead will see how we address the Brexit challenge and how we, as a parliament and a nation, envisage our collective future.I believe our Parliament should be an independent one, but I do not believe that should or would be the end of its democratic journey.Already we can see how, in areas like tackling climate change, the Scottish Parliament can act as an exemplar to the rest of the world.A parliament equipped with the full powers of a sovereign nation would be able to go even further in enacting policies to help make le better for everyone who lives in Scotland.Two decades on from Holyrood’s establishment it seems almost unthinkable that we should have been without a national parliament for over  years – or that we should ever be without one again in the future.The Scottish Parliament has been a force for good, and is the most tangible manestation of the ancient Scottish constitutional principle that sovereignty must always lie in the hands of the people.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the country where nothing goes to waste susan dalgety","story":"There is no shortage of enterprise in Malawi, but the global economy is a brutal market where only the powerful flourish, writes Susan Dalgety.Her accent was unmistakeable. “Come and taste your Malawian wine here,” she shouted, in tones that had been clearly honed in the west of Scotland, not downtown Lilongwe.Clutching my over-full shopping bag, bursting with sweet potatoes, tomato jam and home-made peanut butter, I headed in the direction of the commanding voice, “Beautul Malawian fruit wines, try them here.”I had barely been in Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi, for  hours, and already I had stumbled across one of the many Scots who have built their le here. Not as owners of large farm estates or luxurious tourist lodges, but as Malawians, working as medics, teachers, or as in Margaret Ngwira’s case, small-scale wine producers.Today she was selling her wine at a farmer’s market, set up to showcase small producers, from young women who grow aubergines and peppers in their township, to grandmothers from the north selling honey.“Try some mulberry wine, or strawberry,” Margaret said, pouring me a generous sample of each. And as I sipped delicious fruit wine under the hot midday sun, she explained how a native of Lennoxtown had ended up producing fruit wine here, in the heart of southern Africa.“I came in , as a VSO volunteer, and met Timothy, my husband. We were married in , and I have been here ever since.“Timothy died last year,” she said, quietly, then rallied and offered me a taste of her peach wine.“But I have Lyton, who was the top student at Bunda College, as my scientic officer,” she said, pushing forward a shy young man, “And we are making great wines. We had a blind tasting in the Scottish Parliament with them,” pointing to a board covered in photographs of Linga Wine’s  launch in Scotland.: Scotland’s unique friendship with ‘the warm heart of Africa’ – Susan DalgetyMargaret’s story, of a young woman travelling to Malawi to volunteer, then falling in love, is not that unusual. We are sub-letting the home – and cat – of a young Norwegian woman and her Malawian partner, while they spend time in Oslo with their first baby. Malawi can be a very seductive country.What is perhaps dferent about Margaret is her single-minded commitment to Malawi’s economic development. She is an academic librarian by profession, but since , she and her late husband have been doing their bit to boost Malawi’s export numbers. In , Malawi exported goods and services worth around £. billion. In the same year, Scotland exported £. billion, with  per cent going to the rest of the UK.The global economy is a brutal market. Only the powerful, or those with a precious commodity to sell, flourish. Without sufficient foreign exchange and tax revenues that exports bring, governments cannot afford to properly feed and educate their citizens. It is that simple.Malawi is not powerful, and while there is very likely oil under its magnicent lake which covers one third of the country, it has very few natural resources, and a very modest industrial base. It’s biggest export by far, tobacco, is no longer the cash crop it once was.It is landlocked, which means exporting goods is an expensive, logistical nightmare, and while its fertile land can grow anything, from rice to coffee and fruit for Margaret’s wines, most of the farming is small scale. : Susan Dalgety: Scottish marriages may benefit from Malawi’s chilangizoMillions of people grow just enough maize, pumpkins and tomatoes to feed their families, with a little left over to sell for precious soap, salt and school fees.They are also at the mercy of the ever-changing global climate. A few weeks ago, in the south of Malawi, much of this year’s maize crop was damaged, or even destroyed, by torrential rain and wind.Development experts from rich countries have pondered for decades on how best to support low-income countries to become,not rich, at least moderately better off.The World Bank invests billions each year on interventions to try and grow “ersied, competitive, shock-resilient” economies in countries where classrooms are packed full of children, eager to learn, who will probably leave school with no hope ever of finding formal employment.But there is no shortage of enterprise in Malawi. Everywhere you go, people are buying and selling, making and mending. Nothing goes to waste in a country where even discarded plastic bags can become a football, and self-reliance is essential for survival. “I am collecting these bricks to build a youth and children’s centre,” says Everson Mapayani, who at  is Malawi’s youngest councillor, pointing to a six-foot high pyramid of village-fired bricks made from red African soil.His ward is in Salima District,  miles outside the capital. Its scattered villages, simple primary schools built of breeze blocks and countless maize gardens are typical of the whole country. So too is the poverty. Children in torn, third or fourth-hand clothes, follow us everywhere. Middle-aged women, years of hard work and many pregnancies etched on their faces, sit outside their homes, cooking beans over firewood, while men gather under the shade of trees, gossiping.Everson is up for re-election on  May, along with the country’s President, its  MPs and  councillors.“I will win,” he grins, with all the confidence of a young man in a hurry. “I grew up in a very poor family. I got a place at a government boarding school, but my parents could not afford the fees, so I had to leave after only one term.”He shrugged away the memory. “So I enrolled at the local community day secondary school next to my home and when I was in first year, I became the member of Malawi’s youth parliament for my area. I was born into my family, in this area, for a reason. My dream is to change my ward, physically and emotionally.” His rhetoric may seem a little overblown, even for an ambitious young politician, but his commitment to his home and its future development is unarguable. Just like Margaret’s.“I love my home, my area,” he says, loping off into the early evening sunset, his party baseball cap slightly askew. “See you next week, when I will show you the clinic we built with our district development funds.” Find out more about Linga Wines©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit exposes deep fault line in scotland s constitutional settlement","story":"Brexit has exposed #a deep fault line# in the constitutional settlement and how Scotland fits in the UK, a devolution expert has warned.With the th anniversary of the Scottish Parliament being marked tomorrow, Professor Michael Keating said long-held “informal” agreements on devolution could break down as Holyrood and Westminster argue over who should gain powers reclaimed from Brussels following the UK’s departure from the EU.Speaking at a debate organised by the Scottish Centre on European Relations , Prof Keating said the European framework had helped formalise devolution across the UK.“Political power was restored to Scotland, but in a very strange way,” he told the meeting in Glasgow on Thursday evening, which coincided with Europe Day.“The devolution settlement changed everything in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it changed nothing whatsoever at the centre. It’s an odd kind of federalism. “The deep ambiguity of that settlement is something that we have managed to live with for  years because we have an informality about the way we deal with devolution. There is a convention that Westminster does not overrule the Scottish Parliament needlessly. “Butwe look at that settlement it’s actually full of holes. One reason it has held together is that the whole thing is embedded in the European framework, which fills in for what’s missing in a normal federal system.“The devolution settlement is largely unwritten and down to convention. The EU is a system of laws and regulations.”The Scottish Government has repeatedly accused Westminster of a “power grab” after it was revealed key controls over economic sectors such as agriculture, the environment and fishing previously held by the EU would pass to Whitehall in the immediate aftermath of Brexit.UK ministers insisted such a transfer was vital to retain the integrity of the UK’s “internal market”.Scottish secretary David Mundell has claimed that Brexit, for from being power grab, would actually see Holyrood gain “substantial” new powers as a result.The escalating row saw Nicola Sturgeon last year claim the UK Government had “ripped up” the devolution settlement by pushing through the EU Withdrawal Bill despite four of the five Holyrood parties voting against a legislative consent motion.Prof Keating, professor of politics at the University of Aberdeen, said the UK Government had backed down to a degree on the issue of devolved powers.But he added: “The position of the UK has always been ‘we will have the last word, this is not a federal system’. “But we’ve always managed to work our way around it. It didn’t really matter as Europe dealt with a lot of the issues. It exposes a deep fault line in our constitutional settlement in relation to Scotland and the way Scotland fits in.”He added: “In Scotland we have always thought of power in a very dferent way. We have been in a system of union for  years. Power is ided, power is dispersed. Sovereignty exists in multiple kinds of places. So with Brexit, the question is where does the power come back to ”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them -

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations....— Donald J. TrumpMay , He said he did not believe the negotiations had broken down.“On the contrary, I think it is just a small setback in the talks between two countries, which is inevitable,” Mr Liu told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV.Mr Liu said it was “China’s opinion that the tarfs are the starting point of the trade friction and must be totally lteda deal is reached”.The Trump administration raised tarfs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods to % from % on Friday. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Liu He waves as he departs the Office of the United States trade representative in Washington US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said the US is preparing to expand those tarfs to cover  billion dollarsof Chinese products that are not already facing import taxes, or virtually everything imported from China.Mr Liu also said the two sides disagreed over the amount of goods China would pledge to purchase from the US to help reduce the American trade deficit.He said: “We think this is a very serious issue and we cannot easily change our minds.”Tarfs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier  quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!— Donald J. TrumpMay , Mr Liu sought to downplay the scale and impact of the dispute, saying that China is a strong nation and would surmount any problems caused by the conflict.“We just had dferences on the wording in certain documents and we hoped to solve the dferences,” he said. “Therefore, we think it unnecessary to make an over-reaction to it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hostages freed in burkina faso greeted by macron at airport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, she also hit out at both Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill.Speaking to Channel ’s Alex Thomson Sara Canning said: “It’s been three weeks. I’ve not come to terms with it. I still expect to hear from her every morning. I expect to wake up beside her, and I don’t. You know …“The phone was out she was clicking away, she was texting, she was ringing. She’d gone into reporter mode.“We were only there in total eight minutes. That’s what the police have told us, from the minute we arrived, to the minute it happened, it’s eight minutes.“Well, initially, I… Lyra was clumsy, and I thought she’d tripped over her own feet… and I looked down, and I knew straight away that she hadn’t tripped. And then I noticed that she had a head wound and I put my hand to it and I started screaming for help.”Asked what message she had for those behind the murder Sara added: “It was so indiscriminate.“There was no regard for human le. Why are we protecting that  Andit is your child, I would be ashamed to have a child that had done that. I’d be ashamed.“They took away an amazing person. I’ve lost the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my le with. I was supposed to get engaged today in Central Park. We’d planned the rest of our lives together and in one split second some idiot with a gun took that away.“And then the mealy-mouthed apologies and back-tracking and absolutely pathetic statements that were issued by Saoradh the New IRA.“You can’t apologise for killing someone. You can’t call it an accidental shooting. You fire a gun at a crowd, that’s not an accidental shooting. You’re aiming to shoot someone. I mean, it’s ridiculous. They’re not defending anyone. They’re literally a scourge on their communities. They’re a scourge. They are a scourge.“What I would say is, and this might be heavy-handed, and people might speak out against it or whatever. But I don’t really care – they are grooming young men and women.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“They’re no better, they speak out about paedophile gangs, but they’re no better than paedophiles. They literally take young people who are disenfranchised at the best of times, who are living in poverty, who don’t see a future for themselves in Northern Ireland because there is literally very little here for them. And they tell them that the way forward is a gun in their hand. The way forward is never a gun in your hand.”Sara Canning also revealed what she told politicians who attended Lyra’s funeral in St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast by saying: “At that stage I had looked at who was in the room and I kind of saw red a little bit. So when I was speaking to Leo Varadkar, and I said you need to facilitate these people sitting down at a table.“And so I’m putting my trust in you – you’re a world leader, and you have a presence here. You need to use it for good.“So when I turned from Leo Varadkar, it was Karen Bradley, Secretary of State. Karen Bradley offered her condolences and I accepted them graciously. And I wasn’t rude. But I did tell her that she was doing a pretty terrible job as the Secretary of State. Her lack of knowledge around Northern Ireland was appalling. She needed to go and educate herself. How on earth she had taken a job where she had no knowledge of the area.“She was very gracious I have to say. She nodded and she agreed with me that she had said things that were completely misguided and that she’s gone and educated herself.“As a Derry woman, I had to say to her, to offer your condolences on Lyra when you have turned around and said that soldiers who indiscriminately opened fire in the Bogside on Bloody Sunday were doing their job in a dignied manner. I said they are no dferent to the thug that opened fire in Creggan on Holy Thursday and shot Lyra.”The young Derry woman also spoke to Theresa May at the funeral and recalled what she said to the Prime Minister: “So I basically told her that she was massively derelict in her duties to Northern Ireland and successive governments have [been]. It’s not just been the Tory government. To tell us that issues like gay marriage and abortion rights are a devolved matter is completely out of order. We’re not a devolved state anymore. We’re completely unsuccessful. It has been shown that we can’t work together –so the British government has to be our government. And they have to be our voice and they have to do better. So, that was basically the message that I left with the Prime Minister.”The words of Fr Martin McGill inside St Anne’s Cathedral reverberated around the world when he rebuked politicians in Northern Ireland for failing to talk to each other in order to revive Stormont.“I was the first on my feet. I think. I’m pretty certain I was the first on my feet. And when I applauded, I stood up and I turned my entire body, and I looked to the seats to my right. And I looked at the politicians sitting there.“What I want is, the leaders of the parties, they want broadly the same things. There are red lines and I think we need to look beyond red lines at the minute. Same sex marriage and an Irish language act are important. They are important don’t get me wrong but what’s more important is having a working government who are doing what’s right for the people of Northern Ireland. Because we are, we’ve been left adrt. There’s people missing out on operations and there’s schools missing out on funding. There’s head teachers having to go out and buy toilet roll for their primary schools, because they don’t have the funds to do that,” Sara Canning said.Finally, Sara revealed Lyra’s plans to propose marriage to her and said: ““She had planned a really elaborate proposal at a lake house, on the lake in Central Park. Which one of her best friends Ky has helped her plan.“They had a pdf file and everything. They’d gone, [into] really minute detail. It was incredibly romantic, and she was such a thoughtful person.“She put her heart and soul into everything for everybody. She was always making sure that people were okay and wanted to make everything as perfect as she could. She was really good a planning. She wasn’t great at keeping things a secret. But she was great at planning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"two car collision causing lengthy tailbacks buncrana","story":"There a y tailbacks on the Buncrana Road in Derry due to a two-car collision.The crash has occurred close to St Columbs College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIt is understood no one has been injured.The road is expected to be cleared shortly."},{"url":null,"title":"deborah moggach says presteigne food and flower festival was magical","story":"Making new friends at Presteigne Food and Flower Festival.

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind.

The location is simultaneously recognisable mdash and magically dferent.A love of nature can be detected in the flowers and animals that feature. Maureen Lowersquos watercolour Mayrsquos Out is a close up of delicate spring blossom while snow dominates in Mairead Pattonrsquos North Tor, Slieve Bernagh, making the mountain ascent daunting. Marilyn Priorrsquos whiskered bunny is full of Easter cheer and there is humour in Brenda OrsquoConnorrsquos Mouse Watch in the black cat that patiently awaits its prey.Allusions to history are made in James Carneyrsquos two pieces done in pen and ink in one two women in an old fashioned bar clearly disapprove of lsquoThe state of himrsquo.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

This will include an Olympic Dash course which has fun challenges for owners and their dogs to complete such as the loose lead egg and spoon race, with prizes up for grabs. Owners can also enter into a ‘Best trick of the day’ competition.Other activities available will include a Doggy Dash, a raffle, ious stalls and Dogs Trust Tombola. There will be Canine Carers on hand to offer rehoming advice, free microchipping and a Dogs Trust Reunion.Dogs Trust Ballymena Supporter Relations Officer Samuel Reid said: “Everything we do is for our rescue dogs and we hope you and your four-legged friends can join us on the day and show your support. It’s a fantastic opportunity to meet local dog lovers and raise pounds for the hounds in our care as the proceeds from the day help us to care for dogs like five-year-old Lurcher cross Banjo , currently staying at the Rehoming Centre.”Entry is £ per adult and children are free but encouraged to donate one tin of dog food.

It is a big part of my le. It is not really like work, it is just like going out and meeting friends,” he said.“Our customers aren’t just customers, they are more like friends because we have got to know them over so many years. People come back week after week, year after year, and believe it or not I am now dealing with some of their children.”As the longest-standing trader at the Wednesday market in Larne, outgoing Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Cllr Lindsay Millar, recently presented Gerry with a special clock in recognition of his contribution to the borough’s markets.Although most markets aren’t as busy as they once were – something Gerry puts down to changing shopping trends and the growth of the big out-of-town supermarkets – he still trades weekly in Lisburn, Larne, Antrim, Dungannon, Ballymena and at St George’s in Belfast, as well as running Silverfin Seafood Specialists in Newry.Askedhe is considering retirement, the busy -year-old father-of-six and grandfather-of- says he has no plans to hang up his apron any time soon.“Hopefully I’ll be fit to do another  years,” he laughed.Gerry, who knows many of his customers by name, added: “I’d just like to thank all my loyal customers for all their support and friendship over the years.” with her -year-old mother Elizabeth who she has met for the first time.

We place our animalrsquos welfare at the top of our list, and they only make up a very small portion of the show.ldquoTheyrsquore not just animals, theyrsquore part of our family. They want for nothing with us.ldquoThey do travel, but its no more intensive than an average commuter bringing along their dog in the car.ldquoWhen we pitch up, they stay in large, custom built and comfortable enclosures. Wersquore staying at a venue in Rhoose rather than Sully this year, because it is a more secluded area which the animals prefer.Animal welfare is a devolved issue.While it is an offence under the Animal Welfare Act  to fail to provide for an animal properly, a bill will be put forward this year by the Welsh Government to ban wild animals in circuses entirely, though some animals - such as dogs or ponies - are not covered. England will introduce a similar bill in .A public consultation, carried out in Wales in November  and published in January , found that out of , responses,  per cent of responses were behind a ban on wild animals in circuses.But a total of , of these responses were identical, from campaign group Born Free.More than  local authorities in the UK have a ban on animals in circuses, but the Vale council is not among them. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Adam Drummond, head of political polling at Opinium said it was ldquoremarkable the new party could be on the cusp of overtaking the party of government.Although Mr Drummond cautioned the European election in less than two weeks could be ldquobleeding into and ldquoinflating the Westminster results, the level of support was still notable.He said: ldquoIt would be reasonable to assume that this would fall back in an actual general election campaign, but the fact a party that is less than six months old is now vying with the governing party for second place is remarkable.ldquoThe Toriesrsquo reliance on Leave voters seemed sensible in the aftermath of the referendum.ldquoBut raising expectations of the kind of deal the UK could get and using the phrase lsquono deal is better than a bad dealrsquo so relentlessly was always going to open the party up to this kind of challenge once those expectations could not be met. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Ann Widdecombe during a Brexit Party rally while on the European Election campaign trail in Durham  --The two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, continue to drop votes, with Labour falling five points and the Tories four in the last fortnight.But the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats are reaping the rewards of public frustration and are both on the up, with the former rising five points and the latter four ndash taking the Lib Dems to fourth place with  points.When it comes to the European elections, the Brexit Party is galloping ahead into first place with % support ndash doubling the existing gap to  points. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the Young Labour conference in Birmingham, where he made an announcement on the real living wage  --Labour, coming second with %, has fallen seven points in the last fortnight and the Lib Dems are in third position with %, having risen five points.The Tories have dropped another three points to stagger into fourth place with % support.Mr Drummond said Remainers were split on which party to support and % would like to seea pro-Remain alliance. He said: ldquoOn the European elections, while the question of which party Brexit voters should back was settled some time ago, the equivalent for Remain voters is still ambiguous.ldquoThe picture is most stark when we split out Leave and Remain voters ndash while % of Leavers say they will vote for the Brexit Party in the European elections, the most popular party among Remainersonly has % versus % for the Lib Dems and % for the Greens.ldquoInterestingly, Brexit voters have deserted the Tories to such an extent that the Conservatives actually have a higher share of the European vote among Remainersthan among Leavers .Opinium Research carried out an online survey of , UK adults over  years old between May  and  and results have been weighted..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit Party overtakes Tories in new general election poll article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
