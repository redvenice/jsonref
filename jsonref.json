Also in the picture are the Queen and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s older sister Jane. A friend of the Duchess said today that she believed the picture was taken  at the exclusive Guards Polo Club at Windsor. Her late father, Ronald Ferguson, had helped to start the club together with Prince Philip. It wasn’t the first time the pair had met as Sarah had moved in royal circles since she was baby. But the friend added: ‘Even at the age of ten Andrew and Sarah knew that they would marry!’          Scott was  extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty                                                    He arrived in London via Paris on a train reserved for German generals, smuggling important intelligence reports in 1941 and became the private secretary of King Peter of Yugoslavia, who was also living in exile in a suite at Claridge\u0027s.He spent several years working for King Peter before setting himself up as a photographer. Voynovich took his small Leica camera everywhere and often his hosts at weekend country house parties would invite him to take pictures.He was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, Princess Elizabeth\u0027s private secretary, so it was not long before she saw some of these pictures. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested Voynovich photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies.   This launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work.The auction takes place on June 14. CCTV footage of ISIS member Safaa Boular near the MI6 buildingHearth-stopping moment driver dodges train in police chaseMoment masked thug tries to break into car using huge macheteRobbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopMoment reckless lorry driver crashes into a low bridgeTourist mugged by gang outside Magaluf rocksExcited dog has the time of its life jumping in and out of fountainPartners in crime: Golden retrievers open toddler\u0027s door for foodShocking footage of mass brawl between twelve peopleRoseanne Barr looks worn out as she chats on the phone in UtahThe new F35 Lightning fighter jets arrive at RAF Marham in NorfolkSmoke pours out of famous Mandarin Oriental in KnightsbridgeAmong the collection are dozens of snaps of a young Princess Anne, often with her horses. She was crowned the \u0027busiest Royal\u0027 for the second time after clocking up 455 official engagements in 2017. Anne put her younger family members to shame with a dizzying roster of UK gala dinners, receptions and charity events - as well as a further 85 engagements overseas          Prince Charles, in muddy polo gear, speaks to one of his dogs at Smiths Lawn Polo Ground Windsor in the 1970s. In 2005, and after 40 years and quite a few fractures, the Prince of Wales announced his retirement from polo - the sport he once described as \u0027my one great extravagance\u0027. He played in matches from the age of 15 and as a child watched his father play          This unusually candid snap of the Queen kneeling on the grass with a reclining Lord Mountbatten (left) at a horse show reveals how remarkably unruffled she could be. Surrounded by her friends and family, she calmly watched the event - despite the crowd gathered behind herThe picture that made him: A young Princess Elizabeth saw some of Colonel Vassa Voynovich\u0027s pictures of her friends as he was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, her private secretary. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested he photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies in 1951. The success of this image launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. Wearing a flat cap and a tweed jacket, the keen horseman has often taken part in races and polo matches. Last year he opened up about the emotional moment he cradled his  racehorse Allibar when it collapsed and died during training in 1981          Prince Philip cooling off after a polo match. Scott, an ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Queen Elizabeth, right, is pictured enjoying a conversation with her mother while out with her camera. The pair shared a close relationship, particularly after the death of King George VI, but aside from a love of horses did not share many common interests.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the M*A*S*H stars - most of whom were still in costume. According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) meeting Bionic Man actor Lee Majors with his then-wife, Charlie\u0027s Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and movie royalty Sophia Loren  and Cary Grant at a star-studded Hollywood party in 1977          One of the photos shows the Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life. I went to Mother Teresa’s home and found the direction I’ve been searching for all these years\u0027          Prince Charles dancing in Rio offers a glimpse of the one-time playboy prince cutting loose and unwinding on a break to South America in 1978.  As he celebrated his 30th birthday that year Prince Charles was still the world’s most eligible bachelor"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/13/4CEF5CF500000578-5807497-image-a-20_1528201988840.jpg","title":"How huskies Pets play hide seek pile toy animals","story":"    In the clip the two huskies can be seen sitting perfectly still among the cuddly toys and pillows          The two obedient huskies stay still even after the cameraman moves closer to them in the video which was filmed in Sun Prairie, WisconsinAs the camera pans only their eyes can be seen moving, despite the cameraman moving closer and closer.Adorable dog refuses to let his ‘phone addict’ owner have...Family left in shock when they release the butterfly they...Share this articleAt the end of the clip the obedient huskies jump up, leaving the toys and pillows scattered around them.The happy pooches then lick their owner, clearly delighted that they can finally move again.           At the end of the video the huskies jump up, sending the pillows and cuddly toys flying"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1F7BD00000578-5809377-image-m-4_1528223340106.jpg","title":"Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade inspiring accessory","story":"    Kenneth Cole wrote then deleted this tweet on Tuesday morning after news of Kate Spade\u0027s death emerged           Spade and Cole are pictured in 2002 at an event in New York City.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

Akbar Al Baker (centre) later defended the carrier, saying it was the first Middle Eastern airline to have a female pilot and that other women were in senior roles. Pictured left, IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and right, Qantas chief executive Alan JoyceBut his remarks sparked backlash on social media.Al Baker, who also sits on the board of Heathrow, is one of the airline industry\u0027s most outspoken and controversial figures.He is known for blistering and often humorous criticism of rival airlines and planemakers, but he has drawn criticism for being insensitive or disrespectful.In 2017, he apologised after calling American flight attendants \u0027grandmothers\u0027 during a trade row with US airlines, prompting an airline union to accuse him of sexism and age discrimination.While in Ireland to launch the country\u0027s link to Doha, he delivered a speech saying that the average age of Qatar\u0027s flight attendants is 26, so there\u0027s no need to fly with \u0027cr**\u0027 US carriers where passengers are \u0027served by grandmothers.\u0027           In 2017, he apologised after calling American flight attendants \u0027grandmothers\u0027 while saying the average age of Qatar Airways stewardess is 26.

This has nothing to do with you,’ she reportedly wrote. ‘Don’t feel guilty. Ask Daddy!’It was a sign-off that appeared somewhat brutal and cold-blooded yesterday as it emerged that Spade had sunk into a deep depression because her husband was demanding a orce.Was her note blaming him for her suicide? The couple had reportedly been living separate lives for several months and, after 24 years of marriage, he had moved into an apartment nearby, but the truth may prove more complex.Their partnership had produced one of the most remarkable fashion industry success stories of recent decades, beginning with accessories but then branching into clothing, shoes, jewellery and homeware.With her trademark handbags — unveiled in 1993 — and later with her dresses, Spade pulled off that rare feat of creating a brand that was immensely popular with celebrities and yet not so expensive that it was beyond the reach of ordinary women.Acquiring her famous logo — the spade from a pack of cards — was aspirational but still accessible. Many stars went online yesterday to warmly recall how a Spade bag had been their first designer accessory.The Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa Middleton, Michelle Obama, Gwyneth Paltrow and Taylor Swift have all worn Spade dresses and jewelry or clutched Spade handbags. ‘There was a moment when you couldn’t walk a block in New York without seeing one of her bags,’ said Vogue’s queen Anna Wintour, another Spade fan.Her success — more spectacular in the US than in the UK where there are seven stores — made her very famous and very wealthy but it also made her deeply unhappy, according to her older sister in a series of statements.          She was found at her home in Manhattan just after 10am (pictured, a gurney is wheeled into the designer\u0027s apartment building)Stressing that the suicide had come as no surprise to her, at least, Reta Saffo has claimed that Spade had long struggled to cope with an enormous success which only accentuated her problems with undiagnosed manic depression (or bipolar disorder). Miss Saffo’s account hasn’t gone unchallenged by other family members, however. Within hours, a source told People magazine the two sisters had long been estranged, adding: ‘The family is disgusted and saddened that at this time of great sorrow, Kate’s sister who has been estranged from the entire family for more than ten years, would choose to surface with unsubstantiated comments.’The source added: ‘Her statements paint a picture of someone who didn’t know her at all.’Miss Saffo wasn’t the only one to say that Kate Spade had been struggling to hold it all together. According to the website TMZ, her husband told police investigators his wife had been drinking heavily, and that she was depressed over their separation and her business problems.And the revelations that a designer associated with sunny cheerfulness, bright colours and sweet, lively designs (‘You couldn’t walk into her boutiques and not smile’, said the actress Mindy Kaling) was hiding a very dark side to her life has shocked fans and fellow fashion industry figures.Kate Spade killed herself \u0027after her husband demanded a...Kate Spade\u0027s husband Andy seen for the first time since...Share this articleFern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week and friend of Spade for 30 years, described her as ‘the last person on earth you’d think would take her own life’. She added: ‘She and Andy, they were a team. I mean they were adorable together.’Spade’s family said in a statement: ‘We are all devastated . . . we loved Kate dearly and will miss her terribly.’Their reticence is in contrast to Miss Saffo, who said her sister had been suffering a ‘debilitating’ mental illness for the past three or four years and was ‘self-medicating’ with alcohol, terrified of the consequences for her business if she sought medical help and word got out about her fragile state.Her suicide ‘was not unexpected by me’ she emailed the family’s hometown newspaper the Kansas City Star. “She was always a very excitable little girl and I felt all the stresspressure of her brand may have flipped the switch where she eventually became full-on manic depressive.She also suggested that the circumstances surrounding her sister’s untimely end were rather more complicated than simply the breakup of her marriage.According to Miss Saffo, both she and Mr Spade had repeatedly urged the designer to get medical help for managing her bipolar disorder.In the end, however, she had refused — for the good of her business.          Andy Spade and Kate Spade are pictured attending the AOL Build Series to discuss their Frances Valentine project last year in New York CityWith her 1960s-style beehive hairdos and clothes, Spade’s personal image reflected that of her brightly hued bags and fabrics. It was this image, says her sister, that she was terrified would be ruined if word got out that she was being treated for depression. ‘My little sister Katy was a precious, precious little person. Genuine in almost every way,’ said Miss Saffo, 57.‘But she was surrounded by “Yes” people for far too long, therefore she did not receive the proper care for what I believed to be (and tried numerous times to get help for) bipolar disorder . . . stemming from her immense celebrity.’She said her sister never expected — ‘nor was she properly prepared’ — to become a household name.‘Unfortunately, untreated, it finally took its toll on her,’ she said of the designer’s mental illness. ‘A tragic and sad ending to the life of a very colourful and delightful being.’Miss Saffo recalled being with her sister in a hotel near her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the news broke that the actor Robin Williams had hanged himself in 2014.Spade couldn’t tear herself away from news reports about the tragedy, watching them over and over again. ‘I think the plan was already in motion as far back as then.’She recalled that one of the last things her sister said to her was to ask her to come to her funeral. ‘Reta, I know you hate funerals and don’t attend them, but for me would you please come to mine, at least. Please!,’ Miss Saffo recalled. ‘I know she perhaps had a plan but she insisted she did not.’The grieving sibling said that she and Andy Spade had become increasingly worried and, among treatment options, had suggested the designer visit the same facility that helped the actress Catherine Zeta-Jones with her own bipolar disorder.Miss Saffo said that over the past three or four years she had flown several times to Spade’s homes in New York and Napa, California, to urge her to get treatment. They would get ‘so close to packing her bags but — in the end, the “image” of her brand was more important for her to keep up,’ she told the Kansas City Star. ‘She was definitely worried what people would say if they found out.’On one occasion, staff from the facility that treated Zeta-Jones offered to fly to New York to collect Spade, said her sister. ‘She was all set to go — but then chickened out by the morning,’ she added.Miss Saffo eventually gave up, explaining: ‘Sometimes you simply cannot save people from themselves!’In the upper reaches of the fashion world Spade, sadly, is by no means alone in deciding to end a glittering career by suicide. The British stylist Isabella Blow took her life in 2007, followed three years later by the designer Alexander McQueen, who hanged himself.And in 2014, L’Wren Scott, another designer and also famous as Mick Jagger’s girlfriend, hanged herself in her Manhattan flat. It later emerged that, beneath the image she carefully crafted of having a perfect life, she was heavily in debt, had few close friends and was reportedly no longer in a relationship with Jagger.Reta Saffo’s account of her sister’s terror at being similarly exposed as having a less than perfect existence has prompted some observers to decry the brutality of the fashion world — where rivalry is vicious and image is everything.Just last year, the American designer Tom Ford claimed that ‘fashion is evil . . . you stay out for very long and people forget who you are’.Born Katherine Brosnahan in Kansas City, Missouri, and one of five sisters, Kate Spade had wanted to be a TV journalist but switched to fashion journalism after temping at a magazine. She met Andy Spade when they both worked as sales staff in a men’s clothing store in Phoenix, Arizona.They bonded over their love of fashion and Spade determined to have a go herself after deciding there was a huge gap in the market for simple, sensible and stylish — but not too cutting edge — high quality handbags. She sketched out designs on huge sheets of white butcher’s paper.In 1993, they launched their brand, Kate Spade New York, marrying the following year. The company was a runaway success, the boxy, retro-looking bags rapidly being seen on the arms of the stars, and had notched up $28 million in sales within five years.The Spades sold the majority of their company to the fashion giant Nieman Marcus in 1999 for nearly $34 million and the remainder in 2006 for another $59 million. (The company they set up was sold to Coach last year for $2.4 billion.)Spade stepped back from the business in 2007 after the birth of their only child, Frances. ‘I took off a good nine years raising my daughter and absolutely adored every moment of it,’ said Spade. ‘But then I realised that she was becoming 12 and really didn’t want me around so much, so I thought I’d get back into the business.’In 2016, the Spades plunged back into fashion launched a new brand of luxury bags and shoes called Frances Valentine.Spade’s death has provided yet another salient reminder about depression and how it can lurk in the most unlikely places. Spade was famous for projecting an aura of breezy cheerfulness in interviews. She was invariably smiling in photographs and often holding hands with her husband.Spade’s niece, the actress Rachel Brosnahan, star of hit TV series House of Cards, remembered her as ‘effervescent’, ‘exceedingly kind’ and ‘beautifully sensitive . . . Knowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered.’Sadly, her decision to take her own life means that is rather unlikely.For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local branch.

It\u0027s pretty old and it\u0027s a shame to see it happen.\u0027Penelope Evans, 50, from Battersea, south London, was shopping in Harrods when she noticed the thick smoke as she was leaving.\u0027I saw all this black smoke coming from the sky, it was covering everything and the smell was horrendous.Almost 200 missing and at least 75 are dead as thousands...\u0027Peking Duk tasting about as good as Meat Loaf\u0027: Australian...Share this article\u0027It was like people were in shock, everyone immediately just started leaving the street and the area.\u0027There were hundreds of fire engines, ambulances, police racing by and helicopters overhead.\u0027After Grenfell, I feel like people are a lot more on edge about these things, people just wanted to get out.\u0027A local businesswoman, who did not want to be named, said: \u0027The fire was in the middle of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.\u0027There was a lot of smoke.

It is not yet known what caused the fireEyewitnesses posted videos of the flames on social media showing the large column of smoke rising from the top of the building and people in nearby Hyde Park turning their heads towards the sky.One user called Arthur said: \u0027Looks really bad. Prayers to those inside.\u0027While another, Penelope Evans tweeted: \u0027My wishes to anyone is are hurt or effected by this.\u0027   \u0027The fire brigade have corned off the street and the customers from the surrounding shops have been evacuated.\u0027There\u0027s quite a lot of debris on the street. I can still see a little hue of red from the roof. \u0027I didn\u0027t see anyone seem to be in too much distress - it\u0027s under control now, I hope.\u0027The fire comes just weeks after the Hong Kong-owned hotel recently finished the most extensive and costly refurbishment in its 115-year history, with rooms only re-opening to the public last Tuesday. The establishment was modernised as part of a multi-million pound restoration, as its 118 rooms with views across London\u0027s Hyde Park were transformed.The last fire known at the hotel was 119 years ago in 1899 when flames engulfed the top three floors.           Fire crews are pictured with police men and women in Knightsbridge as they dealt with the blaze          As many as 20 fire engines (one pictured) were scrambled to the scene this afternoon           The Mandarin Oriental Hotel reopened this month following a massive refurbishment which saw each of the 181 rooms and suites altered by internationally renowned designer Joyce Wang, featuring custom-designed furniture and curated art worksThe 181 rooms and suites were created by the internationally renowned designer Joyce Wang - featuring custom-designed furniture and curated art works. Following its relaunch, the hotel offers rooms from 47 square metres located within the hotel\u0027s turrets to the 397 square metre Mandarin Oriental Penthouse - which has three bedrooms.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town. That how it was,\u0027 Wang said.In recent years, selfie-snapping day-trippers could roam freely through Houtouwan.However, since last year, local authorities have charged 50 yuan (£5.83) for entry, while confining tourists to a single circular walking loop through a village frozen in time.  The site 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Shanghai captivates tourists with its fairy-tale setting and East China Sea vistas  The big seas that lash the coast made it too dangerous to land small craft, meaning the only connection to other communities on Shengshan was a strenuous trek up a steep, winding path  The seaside village now lies empty because it was more economical for the fishermen to move and work on the mainland Many of China\u0027s villages have disappeared due to economic development, inaccessibility, poverty and social changes, among other factors.Nearly 900,000 villages across China were abandoned or destroyed in the first decade of this century, historian Feng Jicai previously told Jinan Daily News. In 2014, a study on the nation\u0027s rapid urbanisation in rural areas was conducted by Chinese researchers, who  visited 91 remote villages  in a seven-month expedition.  They discovered that some villages with development value have been commercialised with shops and tourism, while some were abandoned as many young villagers have moved away to find work in the city, according to Guangzhou Daily.The famous Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun\u0027s hometown - Chaolei Village in Fuzhou City - was completely demolished because of the construction of Fuzhou Railway Station.Another remote village, Maijieping, located 800 metres above sea level in Yanshi city of Henan province, is home to only four remaining elderly residents after younger families have moved to neighbouring cities.However, Houtouwan is perhaps the most renowned \u0027ghost village\u0027 due to its fairy tale-like reclamation."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/12/4CF8AF6400000578-5811943-image-a-41_1528283467655.jpg","title":"Mans portable charger suddenly EXPLODES ball flames bus","story":"    The man is seen taking a bus in Guangdong last Wednesday when his bag suddenly burst into a ball of flames right in front of him.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.

Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town. That how it was,\u0027 Wang said.In recent years, selfie-snapping day-trippers could roam freely through Houtouwan.However, since last year, local authorities have charged 50 yuan (£5.83) for entry, while confining tourists to a single circular walking loop through a village frozen in time.

An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

In 1970, the first annual Pride month followed, along with the Christopher Street Liberation Day and the first gay pride march in American history, where hundreds marched to Central Park.Years later, Pride month continues to be a time for the LGBT community to celebrate and commemorate. This year, a series of LGBT art exhibitions are popping up, from billboards in Los Angeles to photographs of drag queens.Opening at SOMArts in San Francisco, this group exhibition curated by Rudy Lemcke features politically charged artworks by 15 artists. With the modern LGBT movement emerging out of resistance against violence, oppression and censorship, this exhibition features works “that speak to homophobic, transphobic and gendered violence”, said Lemcke. “It’s about the deep wounds that have shaped our identity as a community.” Among the artists, Jamil Hellu is showing artwork inspired by Russia’s anti-LGBT propaganda law. “I am committed to speaking out against human rights abuses and bringing attention to the sociological ramifications of violence against gay people,” said Hellu. “It’s so important to keep the awareness alive that in many other parts of the world people are still being oppressed and persecuted to death because of homophobia.”The New York artist takes his work outdoors in Los Angeles, showing on a pair of digital billboards on Sunset Boulevard. As part of the Rich Picture, a video art billboard series curated by Jessica Rich, Newsome is showing Knot Variations, which taps into the ballroom culture and vogue dance movement that surfaced in Harlem in the 1980s. “How do marginalized people find some upward mobility by using the culture they create when it’s not being celebrated by the masses until it’s adjacent to whiteness or being recreated by white America?” he asked. “Voguing got going around the same time as the Aids crisis began, and as more people swooped in, the conversation was soon driven by people who weren’t part of the community. It’s not that people can’t participate in the culture, but those who create the culture need to have agency over it. This is work that is with, for and about the community.” The Los Angeles Art Association has partnered up with the city of West Hollywood to present a group exhibition celebrating LGBT life during West Hollywood’s Pride Month festivities. Opening on 8 June, the exhibition is held at Gallery 825, featuring artists including Dwora Fried, who creates mixed media assemblages based on identity, portrait photographer Jim Zver and Xunzhi Sun, who is showing works from his BirthMark series. Peter Mays, executive director of the LAAA, says this exhibition “offers expression, agency and celebration of artists addressing their own, inidual pride experience”. What does a queer portrait look like? Curated by artist Liz Collins, this group show of 95 artworks opening 14 June at the Bureau of General Services – Queer Division offers a look into queer portraiture of today, including former Sex and the City actor, activist and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon. On a colorful wallpaper, portraits are hung salon-style by artists like India Salvor Menuez, the famed model who founded the Luck You artist collective, singer-songwriter Justin Vivian Bond and JD Samson from the band Le Tigre. “It’s a celebratory, vibrant and sensual experience that lays bare a rich and multifaceted community of creative people at an important cultural site in New York City,” said Collins. “Through the layers of images and varied representations of self and others coming from the queer art world, this exhibition aims to engulf visitors in a world of beings as a celebration of life.” Opening on 9 June at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York, this group exhibition features 12 New York artists who work in photography, including portraits of gay couples by Andrew Jarman and snapshots of drag queens by Alexis Ruiseco-Lombera. The goal of the exhibition is meant to examine gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity. “For the artists, photography, the medium of choice, is the weapon and the target,” said the museum’s director, Gonzalo Casals. “It allows them to communicate the complexities of a queer world always about to exist, while transgressing – or ‘queering’, as put by the curators – the traditional forms of portraiture and landscape to give us a glimpse of a queer future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4432ae43122fbe247c5a1beb9574c79b5512b3ca/0_121_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e348510c07f6c670ed6ad62b6f53a0d","title":"sanne de wilde best photograph island of the colourblind pingelap micronesia","story":"‘It’s the most colour-blind place on Earth. I had to take four flights to get there. I wanted to celebrate their unique way of seeing the world’I shot this image of Deke, one of the smaller islands of the Pingelap atoll, in the Federated States of Micronesia, in 2015. I had travelled to the atoll to research achromatopsia, a rare genetic condition that causes complete colour blindness and hypersensitivity to light. In severe cases, all you can see is shades of grey. Worldwide, only one in every 30,000 people have achromatopsia. But on Pingelap, one in 10 do. It’s the most colour-blind place on Earth.The prevalence of achromatopsia on the island can be traced back to the 18th century when it was engulfed by a typhoon, leaving around 20 survivors. The ruler carried the recessive gene that causes the condition. After a few generations, more or less everyone on the island was related to him.Getting to the islands was arduous, involving three flights to get from Amsterdam, to Pohnpei, then another on a four-seater plane over to Pingelap. As soon as I arrived I was welcomed. A member of the family I was to stay with met me at the landing strip with a marmar, a floral wreath to wear in my hair. On one of my final nights on the island, one of my host family’s relatives came over from Pohnpei. They prepared a ceremony for me and killed a pig – something usually reserved for weddings and funerals – and announced that I was “one of the family, once and for all.”.Trying to understand the place of achromatopsia in Pingelapese culture wasn’t easy. When you can’t see colour, the concept doesn’t really mean anything. In a bid to understand what the world looked like for the islanders, I prepared workshops where they would draw and paint over my images. Most people discover they are colour blind when they come to paint or draw. It can be a moment of shame, or loss. Instead, I wanted to celebrate their unique way of seeing the world.I took this photo after the first workshop, as the boat was returning to the mainland. It was a special day, and I wanted to mark the occasion. I shot it with a Nikon fitted with an infrared lens and a colour filter. I had no idea the shot would look like this until I got home, and I didn’t retouch the colour balance at all – this is how it came out. It was the perfect way of capturing a project that was all about seeing the world differently.Looking at it now, I can’t help but compare the scene to images of refugee boats that have filled television screens over the last few years. That might be reality for the Pingelapese in a few decades’ time. The Marshall Islands and Micronesia are likely to be some of the first places to disappear if sea levels continue to rise. They live in tiny, harmless economies, but it’s they who will pay the price for the way the west lives.Studied: Painting at Sint Lucas in Antwerp and photography at the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Ghent.Influences: “My dad, who was a photographer, and Michael Jackson.”High point: “I just gave a talk about the Island of the Colourblind in Norway, and a guy came up to me at the end and told me how much he loved my work. Hearing someone express such genuine emotion at something I’d created felt amazing.”Low point: “When I went back to Micronesia two weeks ago, I wanted to put my camera away and relax for at least one day, but I ended up spending the whole evening replying to emails. It’s just so hard to find time for myself at the moment.”Top tip: “Don’t burn out! Believe in what you’re doing and throw yourself into it, but make sure you leave time to rest and recharge.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948084d12f34edaf4929b0d381e8cf92d5303fc3/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daadbdfff8bd91c83a43f7ba8b4dd289","title":"british sculptors in pictures anne katrin purkiss photographs","story":"Cornelia Parker, Elisabeth Frink, Damien Hirst and Grayson Perry are among the artists Anne-Katrin Purkiss captures in striking portraits"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df6856e7dccb3d1a6c76355471dc1ea1cd959217/977_715_2190_1314/master/2190.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2b0a086e89aa93098016163650716b","title":"kamila shamsie wins womens prize for fiction for story of our times","story":"Home Fire, which reworks Sophocles’ Antigone to tell the story of a British family caught up by Isis, takes £30,000 awardKamila Shamsie’s Home Fire, which reworks Sophocles’ tragedy Antigone to tell the story of a British Muslim family’s connection to Islamic State, has won the Women’s prize for fiction, acclaimed by judges as “the story of our times”.The British Pakistani author’s seventh novel riffs on the ancient Greek play in which Antigone is forbidden to bury her brother Polynices after he is declared a traitor. The novel follows three orphaned siblings, elder sister Isma and twins Aneeka and Parvaiz, the latter of whom has left London to work for the media arm of Isis. When Eamonn, son of the British Muslim home secretary, enters their lives, Aneeka hopes to use him to save her missing brother.Announcing Home Fire as winner of the £30,000 award, chair of judges Sarah Sands said the panel “chose the book which we felt spoke for our times … Home Fire is about identity, conflicting loyalties, love and politics. And it sustains mastery of its themes and its form. It is a remarkable book which we passionately recommend.”Shamsie, who grew up in Karachi and now lives in London, beat a shortlist that included US author Jesmyn Ward’s novel Sing, Unburied, Sing, for which she won the National Book Award, and Imogen Hermes Gowar’s debut, The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock.With Shamsie’s novel anticipating a British Muslim home secretary – since the novel was released, Sajid Javid was appointed to the role – Sands praised the novel’s “astonishing prescience” and “the breadth of its ambition”.“Shamsie is funny and exact about the Muslim experience, what it means to be challenged on your identity, what it means choosing between public and private … Her nuance, her sympathies, really make you challenge your own lazy thinking on all this,” she said. “The different characters were all so well-realised that you have sympathy for all of them – even the brother, that was the extraordinary thing. There’s no question what he did was wrong, but you feel sympathy, that it was a terrible misjudgment, that there’s no going back.“To humanise a political story in that way really does show what literature can do, that it can tackle a hard subject that otherwise would never have that sense of layered sympathy and understanding. It really advanced our understanding of the whole issue of identity.”Home Fire, which was longlisted for the 2017 Man Booker prize and shortlisted for the Costa novel award, should also be considered “a really good page-turner”, said Sands.“It is very readable, it’s extremely well written, it’s well plotted, it’s something that could easily be a brilliant television series or film. It’s not that you’re thinking, ‘This is a novel about politics, I need to plough through’,” she said. “It doesn’t feel as if she is straining to recreate Antigone – you could read it without thinking about Sophocles at all. In a way, that just gives it a resonance.”In a week when author Marian Keyes accused the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction of sexism, saying that “male voices are automatically given extra weight” when it comes to prize shortlists, Sands said that she felt the Women’s prize was still needed.“I have absolutely loved immersing myself in women’s fiction for a year, it’s been an absolute privilege,” said Sands, who was joined on the judging panel – which considered almost 200 books – by the journalist Anita Anand, the comedian Katy Brand, the co-founder of the Women’s Equality party Catherine Mayer and the actor Imogen Stubbs.The annual award, which has been won by authors including Lionel Shriver, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Naomi Alderman in the last two decades, was previously known as the Orange prize and the Baileys prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4de33e1687f82abf555fb01f054b98566a1f69e9/27_66_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?w=500\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c409562b771fee4d7ee79f97e99ac63 1000w","title":"tsb admits 1300 customers lost money from accounts","story":"MPs talk of ‘Truly Shambolic Bank’ as chief says 400-500 customers are quitting daily since botched IT switchTSB has admitted that 1,300 customers had money stolen from their accounts – in some cases their life savings – by fraudsters exploiting the bank’s recent IT meltdown.The bank’s embattled chief executive, Paul Pester, also disclosed that the number of people quitting the bank in the wake of the botched IT upgrade was running at 400 to 500 a day, and currently totalled 12,500 since the problems first emerged in late April.During often heated exchanges with MPs on the Treasury select committee on Wednesday afternoon, Pester and two other executives, TSB chair Richard Meddings and Miquel Montes, chief operations officer of parent company Sabadell, were lambasted for paying “pitiful, embarrassing, cringeworthy” levels of compensation to victims of the fiasco.They were asked “Why are you still in your job?” and “Can we be certain that some heads are going to roll?”Nicky Morgan, Conservative MP and chair of the committee, told Pester at the end of the hearing that TSB had “unfortunately earned the epithet ‘Truly Shambolic Bank’”.Pester apologised repeatedly, prompting one MP to say he had “set a new record for apologies”, but rejected suggestions he should consider stepping aside, saying: “I believe I’m the right person to fix this problem for our customers.”Up to 1.9 million of TSB’s 5.2 million customers began experiencing problems with online and mobile banking services on Monday 23 April after accounts were migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to Spanish parent Sabadell’s technology operation.More than six weeks later, some TSB customers are still facing disruption to services. On Wednesday the bank’s website admitted that some were “having difficulties and seeing an error message” when making payments, and it stated that some business account holders were “still having issues”.Pester’s appearance before the committee came shortly after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a stinging attack on the bank’s bosses over their failure to be open and transparent with customers.The bank revealed it had racked up a year-to-date bill of about £70m to cover various costs relating to the problems, which included £11.2m in compensation to customers who had suffered fraud – a figure likely to reach closer to £20m once amounts not yet paid were included.During the hearing the FCA’s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said there had been about 10,600 fraud “incidents” relating to the IT meltdown. However, Pester said that the number who had lost money from their accounts to fraudsters was 1,300. These people had now been refunded, he added.The chief executive said he was shocked to read reports of customers who had waited on the phone for up to nine hours to disclose incidents of fraud. In some cases their life savings had been taken from them.However, Pester said 70 times the normal level of fraud attacks were seen last month, and he described this as “an unprecedented attack across UK banking from organised crime”, adding that TSB was working with a range of agencies in an attempt to track down the perpetrators.Morgan gave details of a self-employed businessman, Paul Catherall, who had £24,550 stolen from his account last month. The bank later made a payment into his account of the same sum, but had offered only £192 compensation, of which £42 was for the cost of phone calls made by Catherall. Morgan said: “I don’t think £192 is nearly sufficient.” She added that some people’s major life experiences such as weddings and house purchases had been ruined by what had happened.The bank also disclosed that it had cancelled overdraft fees and charges totalling £29m in the wake of the problems.The committee also heard that 370 former customers had been affected by a blunder which meant people switching away from TSB to another bank found that regular payments had been cancelled because companies were told that they had died. Pester said a software error was behind the problem, and people were being contacted and offered compensation.One MP, Labour’s John Mann, asked: “How many heads are going to roll?” Meddings said the board had hired City law firm Slaughter \u0026amp May to lead an independent review into the meltdown, which was going to be thorough. He added: “If I’m found to be culpable, then the actions will attach to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed9da651f5139ef91ed8ddab2ef753c40be8cf02/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9e72721a528ebdf58de4f34287abc27","title":"appetite is mysterious lets learn from pregnant women rather than calling them greedy","story":"New research has hinted at the psychology behind weight gains during pregnancy. Yet public health messages can’t seem to get beyondbeing patronising or punitiveOne third of pregnant women “lose control” of their eating, according to a researcher at University College London, and gain an additional 3.7kg, a figure that made me laugh out loud, because if you can count them in single digits and they’re not stones, such weight gains don’t know the meaning of “losing control”. The researcher, Nadia Micali, said something more interesting about her findings than you’ll usually find in the overeating business: “We often imagine that just telling women: ‘Don’t eat for two, don’t eat for two,’ is going to be enough. But loss of control needs to be treated slightly differently in a more psychologically acute way.”When the question is, “Why are people eating too much?”, the first answer is usually public education: tell them to eat less. Then tell them to eat differently. Then tell them in a patronising way, maybe with colourful cartoons. It doesn’t work, because there is no information deficit: everyone knows that celery is healthy and doughnuts are not. Frustrated by the inefficacy of telling people things they already know, public health turns wrathful: tell those lard buckets they will get cancer. Tell them they already have diabetes, and it’s their own fault. Tax them! The thrill of the punitive language gets in the way of any impartial analysis of whether it’s working or something must, because it isn’t, and still they stick with it.Appetite is mysterious, deeper than reason, unresponsive to threat. The “loss of control” in pregnancy is raw and intense. Smart public health would study these women intently – their hormonal swerves, their blood, their neurology, their pupils when they see a Tottenham cake – for they may hold the key that unlocks a puzzle fit for Indiana Jones. But it won’t, because they’re fat, right? So, they must be greedy, and what can you learn from a person without control?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c82f35cb7d5573c504d2f8127679e87fdffc6c1/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd6a9081f9ab62091a44669941b600d","title":"fix eu single currency does not work","story":"Even when it was clearly in decline, the Soviet Union commanded loyal devotion. Its admirers could never quite grasp that the nation instrumental in winning the second world war had a broken economy.The same cognitive dissonance applies to the European Union today. There is the EU as it exists in the minds of its most avid supporters: fast-growing, a defender of progressive values, fighting the good fight against Thatcherism, and marching steadfastly towards greater integration.Then there is the EU as it really is: struggling economically wedded to an aggressive form of neoliberal economics insistent that there is no alternative to a top-down, ever-closer union and spawning anti-elite parties across the continent.Like the USSR under Gorbachev, Europe needs radical reform before it is too late because, as George Soros noted last week, everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. The EU is saddled with a single currency that doesn’t work but unable to admit it. It has forced its weaker members to suffer the consequences of the euro’s design weaknesses with austerity policies it has told those who complain about low growth and high unemployment to sort out their own problems through structural reforms (wage cuts and privatisation) and it has failed to comprehend the anger felt at mass immigration, which has increased the pool of readily available cheap labour.A\u0026nbspparticularly serious\u0026nbspform of this cognitive dissonance seems to afflict\u0026nbspsome left-leaning remainers in the UK. They appear to have forced Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell into softening (or fudging) Labour’s stance on\u0026nbspthe single market, even though they were two of the very few Labour MPs who rightly predicted where Europe would end up if it insisted on following rightwing economic policies.And their insistence that the best way to help those who voted for Brexit is a reformed UK in a reformed EU glides over the fact that they rarely come up with any ideas for what these reforms might look like or how they might come about. That, of course, is because they have no plan other than to return Britain to its blissful prelapsarian state before the referendum. Gordon Brown’s plan to tackle the causes of Brexit – low wages, the sense of being cast adrift, the pressures from migration, the loss of sovereignty and concerns about the NHS – is a welcome and timely exception to this rule. But Brown’s warning that serious change is needed to prevent Britain being permanently paralysed applies equally to the rest of Europe, ided between social liberals and conservatives, between a rich north and a poorer south, and between those for whom globalisation works and those for whom it doesn’t.Those who think that Euroscepticism is just a British phenomenon need to take a long, hard look at the populism on the march across Europe and ask themselves why it is happening. Then they need to work out what they are going to do about it.One option, proposed by Emmanuel Macron, is to make Europe more like the US. Macron’s argument, which makes a lot of sense, is that the single currency is an unfinished and hence inherently unstable construct, which needs a much bigger budget, run by a single finance minister, to even out variations in economic performance. But there is little appetite in the rest of the EU for Macron’s plan, particularly where it really counts: in Germany.Another option would be for Italy to precipitate change by leaving the euro. This is even less likely than adoption of Macron’s plans, because as soon as the financial markets got whiff of the idea it would result in sky-high Italian interest rates and the collapse of an already shaky banking system. Italians with savings would see their value decimated by a return to the lira. The only way Italy will leave the euro is by mistake, and then it would be catastrophic.A third option would be for the conduct of European economic policy to become less fixated on austerity. There could be less emphasis on hitting arbitrary budget deficit targets, a move away from the neoliberal structural adjustment policies imposed on those countries seeking support, an acceptance that those countries trying to cope with migration flows across the Mediterranean need much more financial help than they are currently getting, and a Marshall plan for Africa of the sort floated by Soros. All would be welcome: all would meet with strong opposition from Angela Merkel.By far the best option would be for Germany to take the initiative and announce that it was leaving the single currency, taking a small group of northern European countries with it. This would have a number of clear advantages. First, it would remove the stigma of leaving the euro because the decision would be taken from a position of strength not weakness. Second, the new mark would be a lot stronger than the euro and that would help iron out some of the imbalances in Europe’s economy by making German exports dearer and German imports cheaper. Third, the new hard eurozone would be more like Germany’s original vision of what it imagined monetary union would look like.Fourth, it would breathe new life into plans for\u0026nbspEuropean integration because it could start small and get bigger over time. Countries such as the Netherlands and Austria would be obvious choices as\u0026nbspfounder members of a smaller club bound by common fiscal rules.Finally, it would make a reality of a multispeed Europe in which some countries would be members of the hard eurozone, some would be actively planning to join it once their economies were ready, and some would decide they never wanted to join.As things stand, this is just as big a fantasy as Macron’s integrationist blueprint. Germany is the one country that has really benefited from the single currency and is not going to propose a hard-mark zone that might exclude France. Macron would throw a wobbly if it did.But if European leaders had the opportunity to turn the clock back to before the euro was introduced, this is the sort of plan they would probably come up with. And if this sort of EU had seemed feasible in June 2016, the UK would never have voted for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135378d984791416b4904ac41aa6841d1903c3b8/0_174_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a567aa375f8d1fcd262a2eadf377407","title":"struggling to concentrate on labour and brexit i have an unusual solution","story":"Think of the single market as being like Alton Towers. Should we stay there or build a new theme park? I don’t know whether I have mentioned this, but I think that leaving the EU is a stupid idea. All the time I don’t spend working (staring out of a window), I spend campaigning against this stupid idea. And even I cannot get to the end of a paragraph that has the phrase “single market” in it, while the word “amendment” acts like an allergen. Just to overcome this, I henceforth will say “Alton Towers” in place of single market, “wheeze” instead of amendment, and only use first names: if you need to know which Keir and Chuka I mean, I can only assume you’ve found your happy place and you should stay there.Keir’s wheeze is that we retain access to Alton Towers.

Then there will be people who say: if we’re going to stay in Alton Towers, why can’t we retain our place on the management and create a theme park built for the future, where everything is solar-powered and the snack bars serve vegan fried “chicken”.

But it is the will of the people that we leave the management committee for, you know, reasons. So OK, Keir’s wheeze is not a bad wheeze.Chuka disagrees with Keir’s wheeze, because the lords have a different one, in which we also remain at Alton Towers, but in an area devised years ago for people who have mixed feelings about theme parks but don’t want to be left out. The Norway family have an Ambivalence Day Pass, and Chuka wants one of those. He reckons Tory rebels will buy the lords’ wheeze, because it’s cross-party, but won’t buy Keir’s, because it comes from Labour’s front bench. This makes no sense, unless we assume that Tory rebels don’t know how parliament works. Whoever they line up behind, the result of their rebellion would be the same: defeat for a fragile government and whatever consequences that brings. It’s not as though the lords represent an alternative opposition, or that MPs must choose between disagreeing with Theresa May and hating Jeremy Corbyn more.Ah, but does Chuka have a sub-wheeze (using the word for its true meaning on this occasion)? Is he trying to scoop up Tory rebels, filch half the Labour party and emerge, phoenix-like, when the flames of this unending tedium are done, as the leader of a new centrist party? Dastardly, but along with Tony Blair, David Miliband and Peter Mandelson, Chuka is reaching the point where even his most self-evident statements (“Alton Towers is more fun and professionally run than Lapland New Forest”), ring with self-serving expedience. We’re going to end up leaving Alton Towers for a wreck of a place with crappy elves and no Santa for a reason history will be too depressed to relate – just to disagree with Chuka."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f82acad04dbc95abd8eb0150ea6d39e545f03c13/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9047bb4ad11fe7bc45581682fd5f68f0","title":"england identity politics left right","story":"Progressives need to engage seriously with England’s mood and England’s needs – or cede the ground entirelyWe will be hearing a lot about England over the next few weeks as the World Cup gets under way. But this column is not – at least not explicitly – about football, English or otherwise. It’s a column about England itself. It is a column about the country whose name is surprisingly rarely referenced outside the sporting context, yet a country with which the overwhelming majority of people living in these islands strongly identify.A lot has been written since 2016 about whether the Brexit vote marked an eruption of English nationalism. My experience is that this debate gets ahead of itself rather too easily and that those who make the claim sometimes put their fingers on the scales for reasons of their own. Explicit English nationalism remains nonexistent or dormant, not active, unlike other nationalisms in these islands. That the Brexit vote was, in part, an immense expression of English identity is, on the other hand, beyond dispute.There is much else in the BBCYouGov survey, but we must press on into the politics of what this all means. What the survey shows is that England means an awful lot to an awful lot of people. It also shows that it can’t be treated as more or\u0026nbspless the same thing as Britain. It shows that political\u0026nbspsilence and evasion about England are no longer an option.Many on the left prefer the silence. Some find England embarrassing – a “not in my name” country. Many prefer to navigate the multiple identities of Britishness while leaving the self-identifying English alone. As a result the left of centre is not much represented in the English conversation. I suspect that the English have noticed.Labour embodies this unease. Few Labour\u0026nbsppolicy documents mention England at all, even when they concern policy areas such as the health service or education, which are devolved and on which, therefore, “national” policy actually means English policy. Faced with English identity, Jeremy Corbyn is little different from Tony Blair or Gordon Brown. This week Brown made a fine speech about bringing the country together with a programme of reforms. Yet the word England appeared just once in his speech, and only in the context of English regionalism, not English identity. It is hard to think of any senior Labour politician since Tony Benn or Michael Foot who talked about England with any degree of comfort. Their view of England may have been unduly romantic and radical, but at least it existed.This isn’t intended as a bash-Labour point. For the most part, Labour is no better and no worse than anybody else on the liberal left in this regard. There are honourable exceptions, notably the former minister John Denham, no longer in parliament but actively pushing his English Labour Network. A recent Institute for Public Policy Research speech by the maverick shadow cabinet member Jon Trickett was another important recognition of the need for a political conversation to develop on the left that includes, not ignores, England.England is not going to go away. And the current English mood is a challenge to every aspect of the progressive tradition. As the BBCYouGov survey shows, England is not just a place with a real sense of identity. It is also a pessimistic place. Most people in the survey think England was better in the past. The pessimism is widely shared across all parts of England. Only one in six people in England think the country’s best years lie ahead of it.But this pessimism is not something that need embarrass the progressive traditions in politics. There isn’t much sign of a harking back to whiteness or for the empire. It’s about feeling that the country is incredibly beautiful, has a rich history, and is witty and polite. But the country also used to make things, used to matter more, used to be more caring and connected. The England that cries out from this survey is not at ease, is disempowered, is disconnected from Westminster and insufficiently able to shape its own future at local, never mind national, level.English identity is a cultural issue that requires more than just a constitutional answer. Nevertheless, England is the largest nation in Europe without its own parliament and it has become difficult to argue against one, with powers similar to those in the rest of the UK. An English parliament would force the progressive wing of politics to engage seriously with England’s mood and England’s needs. Compared with an English parliament, combined or regional authorities just don’t cut it.And what is the alternative? If the progressive tradition in British politics cannot find ways of listening to, connecting with and speaking for England, its sense of itself and its sense of place, it risks not just electoral failure but the loss of a much larger argument. To cede the politics of England to the right is to ensure that it is the right that speaks for England. That is what is happening. Yet it does not have to be this way. Bear that in mind as you watch Harry Kane and his team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c40e764d14ee62d01f96546ac3c5310bd35731/0_361_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73528f088aa4e37e1626c801b3fe4780","title":"premier league finances club guide 2016 17","story":"The 2016-17 accounts of all top-flight clubs and what the figures say about their health.

Then I tasted itI’m so bored by hearing about saps, waters and spirits tapped from trees and turned into food. The ongoing obsession with birch, maple and bamboo is madness. Birch, please I don’t care how potassium-enriched it is, or how bioavailable the micronutrients. Anyone who drinks this over-hyped bouji-juice is begging to have their trust-fund decimated by a magic-bean pyramid scheme. Naturally, I was thrilled to find a birch-sap croissant at the upscale restaurant Hide, in London’s hideous Piccadilly. Pass me the chainsaw, I thought: here’s a trend that needs cutting down to size.That’s before you consider the other half of the equation: crimes committed against croissants. Pastry-heads will be aware of the vogue for taking the simple, classic French curl and getting … experimental. Whether it’s charcoal-activated vegan croissants at London’s Coco di Mama, a fermented beef-glazed number sold at Copenhagen’s bakery 108, or the sushi-croissant hybrid available from Mr Holmes Bakehouse in San Francisco, the malpractice is international, unnecessary and deeply grievous.At Hide, I’m handed the croissant blind, in a bag with an embossed seal, and told to hold it horizontally. People stare in the street, wondering if I’m transporting a dead pet. On revealing the precious pastry, I actually laugh. It looks like a toffee apple, or a dog toy. A tennis ball-shaped parcel, with a big stick in it. Ridiculous. Then I take a bite, and my worst fears are confirmed.It’s good. Really good. The sap glaze crackles, yielding a perfectly laminated interior, cool and sumptuous. Aromatics fill my head, like laying on the wintergreen of a woodland floor (smoky too, as if someone vacated a barbecue earlier). There’s a baklava-quoting, emerald scatter of what could be pistachio (I was in a “stuff face first, take names later” mood). Exquisite details surface and submerge: coriander seed in the candied pecan, a little citric zephyr of orange peel. Even the “branch” is burnt liquorice root, impaling the sticky orb in campfire fashion. Earthy yet light, comforting yet mysterious, this pastry delivers.Bad news: it probably won’t replace your commuter treat on a Friday morning. Frankly, there’s not actually much croissant for seven English pounds. But what price inspiration? Worse news is that I have to concede something to the birch-bores and their obsession with magical tree-lymph. It won’t rejuvenate your liver or turn you into a magical faun, but the sap glaze actually makes sense in context.

It is understood an announcement on his replacement is due in the coming days, suggesting a candidate has already been identified.In recent years Dacre has taken a relentlessly pro-Brexit line, using the Daily Mail’s front page to brand judges who ruled parliament must vote on leaving the EU as “enemies of the people” and last month criticised the House of Lords as “dinosaurs in ermine” after it voted to amend Brexit legislation.Lord Rothermere, the chairman of the Daily Mail’s parent company DMGT, said Dacre was “the greatest Fleet Street editor of his generation” whose “many campaigns, investigations and crusades that have held power to account, given a voice to the voiceless and often set the political agenda through six prime ministerships”.Dacre will remain with the company as chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, in addition to advising Rothermere on the changing media landscape.In a statement Dacre thanked Rothermere for giving him the freedom to edit without interference and the backing to assemble “Fleet Street’s greatest team of journalists”, something which was worth “more than all the riches of Araby”.He went on to highlight the topics the newspaper has campaigned on during his tenure, saying: “Whether it has been justice for Stephen Lawrence and the Omagh bomb victims, plastic in supermarkets and in the seas, dignity for the elderly, thwarting Labour’s plans for supercasinos, or putting sepsis and prostate cancer on the map, we have shown that newspapers make a difference.”“Without the Mail, Gary McKinnon, Shaker Aamer and Marine A would probably be in jail and Afghan British army translators, whose lives are now at risk, would not have the chance to live here.”He also praised the campaign against state regulation of the press and pledged to “continue playing as great a part in it as ever”.Dacre’s departure after 26 years in the job will start a fierce competition to succeed him at the newspaper, which sells an average of 1.3m copies a day and continues to have enormous influence over the political agenda. The newspaper’s Saturday edition is now the single biggest newspaper edition in the UK.Potential candidates to take the job include the Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, who has regularly clashed with Dacre and supported remain in the EU referendum, , MailOnline editor Martin Clarke, and current Daily Mail deputy editor, Gerard Greaves. Consistently Britain’s best-paid newspaper editor, last year he took home £2.5m after he received a bonus on top of his £1.45m basic salary. During his time as editor he built unlikely alliances, becoming good friends with former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, despite their political differences.Although DMGT’s newspaper business continues to make healthy profits, the company is changing its focus towards internet businesses under new chief executive Paul Zwillenberg. Dacre was technically editor-in-chief of the MailOnline website, he repeatedly and publicly made it clear that his newspaper was a very different product with a different editorial line to the celebrity-heavy website."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f0230bf372a55352735d5feb091627cce26cbc/0_66_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b7b1cc1cfea40c9020b6c7c884a01f3","title":"customs backstop we expect a time limit stresses david davis","story":"PM battles to restore cabinet unity over proposal to avoid Northern Ireland hard borderTheresa May is facing a dramatic cabinet showdown with David Davis, the Brexit secretary, over the government’s final backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.As the inner cabinet meets at Downing Street to thrash out the final details of the customs fall-back plan, Davis is expected to push for a firm end date to be included in the agreed text.Davis did not rule out resigning if the government’s proposals did not have his explicit approval. “That’s a question I think for the prime minister, to be honest,” he told reporters after a speech at the Royal United Services Institute.It leaves the prime minister battling to restore cabinet unity over her customs plans before she flies to Canada later today for the G7 meeting of world leaders. The clash with Davis came as Downing Street also attempted to head off a series of damaging rebellions in next week’s key Brexit votes, by holding talks with leading Tory MPs who voted to remain in the EU.May has publicly committed to a time-limited backstop, but No 10 sources ruled out agreeing to a specific date in the text, suggesting that it would be unworkable. Cabinet sources confirmed that a four-page draft of the backstop proposal circulated to ministers had prompted the fresh row because it did not include a legally enforceable date. Just hours later Davis claimed that discussions over the document were still carrying on. “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment,” he told reporters during a Q\u0026ampA after his Whitehall speech. “It has been through one cabinet committee, is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive tomorrow.”He added: “I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time-limit on the backstop proposal.” Davis helped to clinch agreement on the backstop in the cabinet Brexit subcommitee last month, in the face of objections from other leave supporters, including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Johnson subsequently warned that the prime minister should ensure she delivered a Brexit deal that avoided use of the backstop. “Brexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire. We want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it,” he said.Davis is understood to believe that offering a deal without a specified end-date would limit his leverage, in talks with Brussels, to negotiate alternative arrangements for keeping the border open. Some Brexiters were irked by the fact they only received the draft of the detailed backstop proposals on Wednesday, claiming other key cabinet members, including the chancellor, had been given longer to consider its wording.Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft later presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market. The EU27 has been waiting for the government to publish its alternative draft backstop proposal, which is expected to include all of the UK temporarily applying the EU’s external tariff – a plan that would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries.No 10 sources said the backstop, which would keep the whole of the UK in key areas of the customs union until a permanent solution to the Irish border problem could be found, would be published today after the meeting. Downing Street played down the row, saying the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary. “It’s important that it’s time-limited even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” a source said. Allies of the Brexit secretary denied he was considering resigning. When news of the backstop plan emerged last month it infuriated hardline Conservative backbenchers who feared that it could become the post-Brexit norm. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, went so far as to question whether the government remained committed to delivering Brexit. Leading Brexiters told the , however, that they would not be “causing a fuss” about the backstop before next week’s Commons votes. But one warned that No 10 should expect renewed pressure over the date once votes were passed. The Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, told MPs that the EU withdrawal bill would now be debated over two days – next Tuesday and Wednesday – but there would still only be 12 hours set aside. A series of Tory rebel remain MPs, including Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve, and Antoinette Sandbach, were seen entering No 10 for talks.The latest clash between May and her Brexit secretary comes after the pair also disagreed about the timing of publication for a white paper setting out key areas of the government’s Brexit plans.Davis was keen to produce a detailed document before the European council at the end of June, but May is more cautious. She refused to give an answer, when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions, when it would be published.After his speech, Davis said: “In debates in Whitehall between fast and slow, I normally vote for fast. That’s probably a given. But what she said today is exactly right – that the white paper will be published when it’s ready, it’s up to quality, and is exactly what we need to say.

Hopeless, indecisive and confused barely covers it.On days like these, cabinet meetings must resemble a convention of zombies fighting over the only functioning brain cell in the room. The best that can be said about it is that at least it is giving the rest of the world a laugh. It’s just a shame for those of us stuck in the UK who have to live with it.Prime minister’s questions is turning into a breeze for Jeremy Corbyn. Where previously he used to overthink things – admittedly not hard in his case – and tie himself up in knots with his own logic, he now just stands up and says, “how’s it going?”As even May is just about sentient enough to realise that “badly” won’t quite cut it, she has no answer. Because she genuinely doesn’t know. There is no area of government policy over which she has a firm grasp. Least of all Brexit.The Labour leader bounced to his feet and demanded to know if the government was going to publish the long-delayed white paper on its negotiating position before the Commons voted on the Lords amendments to the Brexit withdrawal bill next Tuesday. As it might be quite handy. If not essential to anyone hoping to make an informed decision.May’s eyes rotated in opposite directions and her mouth opened and shut as if gasping for breath while struggling for words. “I agree that we want to publish a white paper,” she croaked eventually. The snag was that no one in the cabinet could agree on what should go in it. Or when it should be published. The white paper remained defiantly white.“OK,” said Corbyn, generously choosing to give her another chance. If she wasn’t going to publish the white paper before next Tuesday could she at least promise to do so before the European council meeting? She couldn’t. It was far better that our negotiators were kept entirely in the dark. If they didn’t know what the government’s position was there was no chance of Johnny Foreigner second-guessing and outmanoeuvring us.That was the highpoint of the exchanges. May didn’t even know if the Brexit sub-subcommittees on maximum facilitation and the customs partnership had even met, let alone reached any conclusions. She couldn’t explain how her 10-mile buffer zone on the Irish border was going to work. There again, no one can as it’s a completely idiotic idea.In desperation May went to her default PMQs algorithm and demanded that Labour come up with solutions of their own. If he had had any, Corbyn might have been tempted to list them. But he didn’t, so he merely pointed out that it wasn’t the opposition doing the Brexit negotiations, before adding that the government didn’t appear to think it was its job to conduct the negotiations either.By now the Tory benches were almost entirely silent. There was a time, when May first became prime minister, that they thought her evasiveness and general air of uselessness was a sophisticated act. A means of luring opponents into a false sense of security. That moment has long passed and Conservative backbenchers have come to realise that behind her veneer of incompetence are only deeper and deeper layers of incompetence. Futility piled on futility.Corbyn ended by comparing the chaos of Brexit to the train wreck of the railways. At the mention of the word railways, Chris Grayling, who had spent PMQs in the recovery position near the speaker’s chair, jerked into life, his eyes full of terror. He just about managed to control the spasms in his neck but his head wobbled rhythmically. Failing Grayling isn’t in a good way and it would be a kindness if he was kept out of sight for a while. A kindness both to the country as well as him.With the prime minister now unable to remember her own name or what she was even doing in the chamber, the Tories’ Chris Davies tried to distract her by asking if she would be happy to sponsor a pigeon. “Yes,” she said. It was the only straight answer she gave all day. The unlucky pigeon was tearing its feathers out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15df42086587ab3f632f5e78c9b4b33f85735e0/434_505_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7bdb5450b6edc8932da0a5d62457f7","title":"edinburgh fringe 2018 tackle metoo celebrate blue peter lineup","story":"Lineup for 71st edition includes hard-hitting debuts and plenty of nostalgia An array of provocative debuts will mix with a heavy dose of nostalgia at the 71st Edinburgh fringe festival this August, as creative takes on the #MeToo movement are performed alongside a theatrical tribute to Blue Peter, the world’s longest-running children’s TV show.Launching the 2018 fringe programme with 3,548 shows, the most in its history, the event’s chief executive, Shona McCarthy, said: “Whether this is your first or your 50th time visiting the fringe as a performer or audience member, this is a place where new discoveries wait around every corner.” With venues ranging from a “pianodrome” constructed of 55 recycled pianos in the Royal Botanic Garden to a comedy club hosted in a chicken coop, the programme includes 1,900 premieres, including debuts from the Hi-de-Hi! star Su Pollard, the IT Crowd’s Katherine Parkinson and the singer and actor Jason Donovan.  Weekend columnistBim Adewunmi will present her first play, The Hoard, about the relationship between three sisters.The Assembly Rooms will host Once Seen on Blue Peter, starring former presenters Peter Purves, Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan and Mark Curry along with surprise celebrity guests as they celebrate the world of children’s entertainment.US comedy performers include the spiky Janeane Garofalo, and Judah Friedlander, in the follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2017 Netflix standup show satirising American exceptionalism. As usual, subject matter is eclectic, but emerging themes are sex and consent, including the comedian Ayesha Hazarika’s take on where feminism finds itself in the wake of #MeToo, while a clutch of shows explore the 70th anniversary of the NHS, and mental health. The mixed media performance A Fortunate Man is inspired by John Berger’s exploration of the life of a county doctor 50 years ago, while the director Jeremy Weller’s Where It Hurts shares Edinburgh residents’ experiences of the NHS. The festival will have a particular focus on street theatre, with a new street events arena on the Royal Mile hosting more than 250 shows a day. There are also plans to trial cashless donations for street performers at four stages, after buskers raised concerns that their takings were declining as fewer people carry loose change. McCarthy also emphasised the need to tackle the rising cost of attending the festival. The Fringe Society’s Blueprint document, also published on Wednesday, which lists the priorities in the run-up to the festival’s 75th anniversary in 2022, was proof of “big ambitions to make the fringe more affordable,” said McCarthy.Plans to reduce the long-term cost of performing and visiting the fringe include addressing the cost of accommodation in the city, freezing registration fees until at least 2022, reducing box office commission and exploring affordable ticketing options. McCarthy said she was exploring partnerships with local universities that have empty halls of residence, and was keen to pilot a host-an-artist scheme with Edinburgh residents. The fringe is also working with the tourist body Visit Scotland to map accommodation beyond the city centre and transport provision.This dovetails with a wider move to expand the fringe beyond the city centre: the festival programme will include a map of Leith after the area, which is emerging as an arts hub, had a significant growth in venues last year.Accessibility is another priority, and the festival will provide free sensory backpacks for children and adults on the autism spectrum for the first time. They will include a fidget toy, earplugs and a list of relaxed performances. Earlier this year, the fringe was caught up in a funding row involving Creative Scotland, which was criticised for a series of unexpected choices, leading to the resignation of two board members from the arts body. The fringe was one of those removed from its network of regularly funded organisations, losing £70,000 annually.Cold BloodA dance show with a difference: the beautiful moves are made by three performers’ fingers, which waltz around miniature props and are filmed live and projected on to a huge screen.Trojan HorseAfter shows about the Chilcot inquiry and the 1985 Bradford City fire, the documentary theatre company Lung presents a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools.Jordan BrookesExpect the unexpected: at last year’s fringe, Brookes’ discombobulating set had audiences in stitches before he even made his proper entrance.

The ballistic shields were donated by a local company and given to students at St Cornelius school in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, as a leaving present before high school.In footage of the gifting ceremony, children were left speechless by the sombre tone of the gift. The president of Unequal was also invited to speak, telling students “it’s sad that times have called for such a product to be invented, but we have answered such a call”.Other products on the market include door barricade systems, software that scans social media for the threat of an attack and “active shooter kits”, which claim to offer “the essential items needed to administer first aid prior to the arrival of Fire or EMS personnel”. Students at some schools, including at Majory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, are now only allowed to wear clear backpacks.Some parents are going as far as to remove the children from school entirely. Tim Lambert, president at the Texas Home School Coalition told the Washington Times that they number of calls they receive has doubled in the past few moths, from 600 to around 1,400.At a time of heightened anxiety, the one measure that does not seem to be discussed is gun control. Yesterday, Betsy DeVos said that the new school shooting safety panel created in the wake of Parkland will not consider any gun control measures, or even study the role of guns in school safety. When asked if the commission would be looking at the role of firearms, the education secretary answered “that is not part of the commission’s charge, per se”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3fa009c89342ef1648f44359a61be83f6105393/0_565_4873_2925/master/4873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=152908e716be987a77ae927a5dfd4ff6","title":"nicaragua daniel ortega masaya","story":"Daniel Ortega makes yearly pilgrimages to the symbolic town of Masaya. But in a ‘city at war’, residents demand his exit Graffiti coating signs and billboards on the road to the cradle of Sandinismo offer once unimaginable snubs to the movement’s most celebrated comandante: ‘Despot!’ ‘Murderer!’ ‘Get out Daniel!’ ‘Ortega you are dead!’ Masked rebels toting homemade mortars guard more than a dozen roadblocks that now separate Nicaragua’s capital from Masaya, a storied revolutionary stronghold just 26km south, from which guerrillas launched their final assault on the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979.Almost four decades on from that momentous triumph, and with Nicaragua seemingly in the midst of another epochal upheaval, Masaya now has Daniel Ortega in its crosshairs.“He’s been attacking the people, killing the people. Now the people want him out,” vented one 20-year-old mutineer with a black mortar slung over his shoulder as he escorted the  into the heart of the former Sandinista hotbed – now under almost total rebel control. Masaya has long been a bastion of Sandinista rebellion and rule. Nicaragua’s septuagenarian president makes annual pilgrimages to the intensely symbolic town, where his brother, Camilo, died battling Somoza’s troops in 1978. Today, Masaya is once again in full revolt – this time against the Sandinistas themselves.“Daniel must go,” insisted Rosa Caballero, a 48-year-old hotel manager who said she supported the uprising even though the eruption of violence had paralyzed the town and scared away all her guests.“I don’t think there is any way out,” the mother-of-three added. “All this repression. This whole struggle. It cannot be in vain ... I hope other cities join us so it is total pressure against the government.” Unrest began to grip Masaya on 19 April after protests broke out in the capital in response to planned social security reforms – then swelled into a broader, nationwide insurrection against what many call Ortega’s increasingly authoritarian and corrupt rule.But in recent days the violence – which has so far claimed almost 130 lives across the country – has escalated dramatically. At least 10 people were shot dead here over the weekend, allegedly by police and paramilitary gangs operating at the government’s behest. “It was a bloodbath,” La Prensa, an opposition newspaper that has been documenting the carnage, reported of what it called two nights of terror. “Day and night, Masaya seems a city at war.”In the wake of those killings, Masaya’s streets are tense and entirely devoid of any government presence. Dozens of barricades, cobbled together with tree trunks, concrete paving stones, metal signs and nail-studded planks, block the path into the heart of what was once a bustling tourist town famed for its artisan market. Mortar-wielding combatientes stop, question and search passersby. Stencil artists have set upon homes and businesses with spray cans to pour more scorn on their president. “Go to hell Daniel, you murderer,” is one recurring motif. Meanwhile, perhaps 50 police officers are said to be pinned down inside a local station.“We have no more law,” said Father Edwin Román, a local priest whose church, San Miguel, has found itself at the eye of this rapidly intensifying storm.Before the uprising, Father Román’s picturesque white church was a simple 40-minute drive from Managua. To reach it now, visitors must now sprint down a kind of sniper alley, down which demonstrators and church members claim security forces have been firing at demonstrators and civilians. “Be careful,” one masked rebel warned as he prepared to make a dash for cover. “They don’t care what nationality you are. They’ll shoot you right here,” he added, pointing to his forehead with his right hand and then using it again to suggest the resultant exit wound on the back of his skull. The conflict has transformed Román’s parish home into an unofficial field hospital. A statue of the Virgin Mary keeps watch over an improvised two-bed emergency room located next to what was once his sitting room. A volunteer force of medical students, paramedics and rescue workers camp out on its tiled floor, waiting for their next call. “It’s a war zone,” said a 27-year-old fireman who is part of a team of “blue helmet” rescue workers responsible for collecting the dead and wounded from the streets and dragging them away for treatment or burial. Like many local residents, the fireman said he backed the protests: “It’s the only way of making the government hear our voice.”Nicaragua’s state-controlled media has blamed the mounting body count vaguely on “delinquents” and “criminal groups”. The foreign minister, Denis Moncada, recently alleged a rightwing “conspiracy” was under way designed to destroy Nicaragua’s international image and allow organised criminals to seize control.As he prepared for his latest day on the front line, Father Román dismissed the idea that those now controlling Masaya’s streets were “vandals”. “All walks of life – kids, young people, entire families – are supporting this,” he said. “I think it’s impossible for things to go back to the way things were before.”With no solution in sight, Father Román said he sought solace in the book of Isaiah. “He will swallow up death forever and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces, and the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken,” he said, before adding: “This is the situation that we are going through. Nicaragua is crying. The mothers are crying ... I too have cried.”“I consider this to be like birth pangs. There is blood the blood of the young people, the tears of the mothers. But it will not be in vain,” the priest insisted. “It will be the fertilizer for freedom.”Additional reporting by Juan Diego Briceño"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854bd753bb75eb45c3e64ebc73c1cccb0b0ed61d/0_124_3604_2163/master/3604.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7abdec30d94443a333941ef0876c87a","title":"canada marijuana party legalisation future","story":"Like Ukip after Brexit, the Marijuana party won the very battle it was established to fight. But its leaders insist the resistance continues against ‘prohibition 2.0’When Blair Longley considers Canada’s looming plans to reform its marijuana laws, it is with a degree of trepidation.He is not among those who worry about the impact of drugged driving or the risks for mental health, however. Since 2004, Longley has led Canada’s Marijuana party – whose raison d’être is now complicated by the fact that the country is poised to become the first G7 member state to fully legalise the drug.Now he fears that – like the UK Independence Party after the Brexit vote – his party may struggled to find a purpose after winning the very battle it was established to fight.“It will just get harder and harder for us to survive,” said Longley. “A lot of people will think: ‘What are you doing? It’s already legal.’”The federal government has said that legal recreational marijuana could become a reality in Canada by late August of this year, making Canada the second country in the world to legalise the drug, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada.Longley has little doubt, however, that his party would continue to exist, seeking political opportunity in the way legalisation is rolled out. “In every possible way, what they’re doing is nothing like anything that we campaigned for,” he said. “There’s this slight bit of progress, but when you look at the bigger picture, it’s nothing close to what we would want.”New rules being rushed out across the country mean that once legalisation is in place, some will find it easier to obtain and use marijuana than others, he said. In Nova Scotia, landlords were recently granted permission to ban cannabis use and cultivation on their properties, while Calgary’s city council has passed a bylaw prohibiting pot consumption in public.“Legalisation is great if you’re rich and old and have your own house and can afford to buy expensive marijuana,” said Longley. “But if you’re still young and poor and don’t own your own house, it’s worse than it was before.”Calling the government’s approach “prohibition 2.0”, he pointed to the limit of four marijuana plants per household. “You can brew as much beer and wine at home as you want, there’s no limit. You can grow 15kg of tobacco. So where does four plants come from?”The proposed legislation also includes tough penalties for those who fall afoul of the laws, such as prison sentences of up to 14 years for providing marijuana to a minor or selling marijuana without a license. Others are concerned that the manner in which the legislation is being crafted – often restricting retail sales to government-run monopolies – favours large producers and leaves little room for smaller players to carve out niches for themselves. The Marijuana party has always pushed to have an existing sector – recent federal data estimated that nearly five million Canadians bought marijuana last year – brought into the legal economy, said Marc-Boris St-Maurice, who founded the party in 2000. “If these massive barriers stay in place, there’s going to be no incentive for people to join the legitimate industry.”The seeds were first planted in the early 1990s after a defence lawyer brushed off St-Maurice’s questions about organising demonstrations on the issue.“He was like: ‘You want to change the law, get elected and change the law,’” said St-Maurice, who since 1999 has run a medical marijuana dispensary in Montreal. “Little did he know that his comments would have such an effect on me.”After launching a provincial party in Quebec, he then set his sights on expanding nationally.“At first, people laughed but then quickly realised that it was a serious matter,” said St-Maurice. “Everyone wanted to make jokes about smoking pot and this and that and I would have none of it.” Determined to capitalise on the momentum, St-Maurice resigned and joined the Liberal party in 2004. He has since lobbied the federal party from the inside as an active member. He hesitated when asked whether – given the looming plans for legalisation – the Marijuana party would have a role to play on the political stage in the coming years. “I’m not going to speak ill of the party that I founded,” he said. “I just wonder where the Marijuana party is today in the public discourse. I don’t see them as a huge engine for driving opinion and debate on this.” That diagnosis will be put to the test come January, as Longley and others begin canvassing for the 250 members needed to retain the Marijuana party’s status as an official party. It is a routine exercise demanded of all political parties in Canada, but Longley worries the task may be almost impossible after legalisation.“The glory days of the Marijuana party were back from 2000 to 2003,” he said. With a sigh, he added: “But I expect that we’ll continue to do what we’ve always done, just a token resistance – pun intended. That’s about all that we can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a835a1aeb5e59d7be016c50142fc791d3d33fc/256_146_3129_1877/master/3129.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=845f7a0c523d113132d5ddcb8e51f4e9","title":"rise of far right in italy and austria gives putin some friends in the west","story":"Russian president in contact with two capitals that share belief in nation-first politics and mistrust of alliancesSuddenly, Vladimir Putin has some useful friends in the west.As he looks to improve relations with Europe, at a new low since the March nerve-agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, the Russian president knows he can count on the backing of at least two capitals.Both Austria and Italy’s new governments, formed late last year and last month, include populist, far-right parties that make little secret of their sympathy for Moscow – and have even signed cooperation agreements with Putin’s ruling United Russia party.Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, used his maiden speech in Rome on Tuesday to promise his government would be “advocates of an opening towards Russia – a Russia that has consolidated its international role in recent years”. Conte heads a populist coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League that, according to its programme, sees Russia not as “a military threat” or “enemy” of Europe but as a “potential partner”.He promised his administration would “promote a revising of the sanctions” imposed by the EU on Russia after it annexed Crimea and destabilised Ukraine.A few hours earlier, Putin got much the same message in Vienna, on the first state visit of his fourth term. Russia was “a part of Europe”, said Austria’s president Alexander Van der Bellen, denying Moscow faced “a crisis of trust” with the west.Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who heads a coalition of his conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVF) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), told a press conference he hoped the sanctions could be “relaxed step by step”.The FPÖ leader, Heinz-Christian Strache – now also Austrian vice-chancellor – went further, telling local media that Europe must “end these sanctions … and normalise political and economic relations with Russia”. EU–Russian relations have been badly strained by Russia’s role in conflicts in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria, as well as by accusations of interference in several European elections and, most recently, the Skripal affair.But Putin, apparently now eager to build bridges, has recently begun signalling a clear desire to re-engage with Europe. Russia “does not aim to ide the EU”, he assured Austrian broadcaster ÖRF ahead of his Vienna visit.“We want to see a united and prosperous EU, because the EU is our biggest trade and economic partner. The more problems there are within the EU, the greater the risks and uncertainties for us.”Those words may ring hollow in many European capitals, which – unlike both Vienna and Rome – responded favourably to Britain’s request to expel Russian diplomats in the wake of the Salisbury attack. But not in Italy and Austria, where the FPÖ and the League, both now junior coalition partners, signed ill-defined “cooperation accords” with Putin’s party last year based on a shared belief in nation-first politics and a mistrust of international alliances.Matteo Salvini, the League leader, has denied borrowing Russian money to fund his election campaigns, as Marine Le Pen of France’s far-right Front National has had no qualms doing. But Salvini has often expressed his admiration for Putin and said last month he wanted “to work for peace, not war”.Austria’s Strache, meanwhile, besides calling frequently for EU sanctions to be lifted, has forcefully criticised Nato’s expansion eastwards, arguing it “wasn’t Russia who, in recent decades, has been the aggressor”.It is too early to say what the consequences – if any – of this isolated outbreak of goodwill towards Moscow might be, for the sanctions or Russia-EU relations in general. Kurz was at pains to reassure his EU partners that Austria’s loyalty is of course to Brussels, not Moscow. But Putin will not be unhappy.

It will be followed a few months later by an auction of books and manuscripts from Bergé’s celebrated library, including first editions of Gustave Flaubert, Charles Dickens, Samuel Johnson and Oscar Wilde.Among the highlights of the auction will be 10 paintings from the 1950s by the French expressionist Bernard Buffet, who was Bergé’s lover until he met Saint Laurent in 1958, and a Picasso sculpture called Masque, produced in 1961.The sale is being overseen by the businessman’s longtime partner and legal heir, the American landscape architect Madison Cox, 59, whom married Bergé in May 2017, months before his death.“My number one concern is the longevity of the foundation in France and Morocco. He made the donations he wanted to friends and family, now a new chapter has opened. For me, it’s important to continue the process he began.”Bergé began that process in 2009, shortly after Saint Laurent’s, death with a three-day auction of 700 artworks, including paintings by Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp, Constantin Brâncuși, James Ensor, Piet Mondrian and Giorgio de Chirico. Described as the sale of the century, it raised €374m (£328m) – a record for a single-owner collection.In a series of sales in 2015, Bergé sold his much admired collection of books, including a first edition of The Confessions of St Augustine, a copy of Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy from 1487 William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, Tragedies printed in London in 1664, and handwritten notes for the Marquis de Sade’s last erotic novel.Mario Tavella, the chair of Sotheby’s Europe, said the wide range of objects being catalogued for the auction showed Bergé’s eclectic and “super cultivated” tastes and his “inquisitive mind”.“He collected from every century and every area. I cannot think of a single domain that is not represented in this sale,” Tavella said.“Right now I cannot tell you exactly how many lots there will be at auction because each time we open a drawer in one of these properties, we find something else.”Money raised from future auctions will go to the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation, which has opened two museums: one in the former YSL haute couture house at 5 Avenue Marceau, the other near the Jardin Majorelle in Marrakech, which Bergé and Saint Laurent bought to save from a hotel development.In letters he wrote to Saint Laurent after the designer died, Bergé pays tribute to the support Cox had given him. “Thanks to Madison, probably, I weathered the storm … he gave me what I needed: his youth, culture, courage, integrity, love.”Cox said he was trying to avoid sentimentality when dealing with the auction. “These are pieces I’ve lived with most of my adult life having known Pierre Bergé and Yves Saint Laurent since my early 20s, but I have adopted the policy of not holding pieces back,” he said.“I think it’s important to honour the legacy, as Pierre Bergé did when Yves Saint Laurent passed away. One starts looking and thinking: ‘Oh, it would be wonderful to keep those 18th-century Chinese plates and have breakfast off them’ … but it’s easier to draw line.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521615.1528309534!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish universities being left in the slipstream of our competitors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left:  Aleksandra Nicpon, Grace Akinwunmi and Aliona Tanase, after their Leaving Cert English paper, at Mercy Secondary School, Inchicore, Dublin.Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The International university rankings are deeply-flawed measures of third-level colleges, produced by commercial organisations.But there’s no escaping the fact that they are highly influential indicators which guide foreign investment and flows of international students.That’s why the latest set of university rankings have sparked alarm within higher education.Irish universities have tumbled downwards, with Trinity College Dublin losing its status as our only top-100 university.Senior academics say Government-imposed caps on staffing, growing student numbers and a decade of under-investment have taken their toll.In the meantime, Irish universities are being left in the slipstream of those in rival jurisdictions such as China who are benefitting from massive investment.It is tempting on one level to dismiss this as an issue of little real concern to Irish students.They are, after all, getting jobs and our graduates are well-regarded internationally. But there are real reasons to be concerned. The quality of teaching is under strain in Irish third level. Over the past decade, student numbers in many colleges have risen by more than 20 per cent.However, staff numbers have remained static due to Government-imposed recruitment restrictions. This has led to overcrowded classes, reduced access to practicals and less support for inidual students. This shows up in student-teacher ratios, a key metric used in international rankings. Take the case of UCD. A decade ago, the university ranked in the top-100 (86th place) for student-teacher ratios. Following employment restrictions and reduced State funding, it has plummeted to 536th place globally.Last year, UCD’s president warned that it may have to reduce Irish student numbers to tackle this problem. This could limit supply at a time when student numbers are rising, sending CAO points even higher still.It is clear, then, that either drastic measures or extra funding will be needed if we really are serious about – to quote the Government’s favourite phrase – creating the best education and training system in Europe. But it’s hard to see where funding will come from. Hard-pressed families and students are already paying the second-highest fees in Europe.The prospect of an income-contingent student loan scheme – which could allow for further increases – is off the agenda after the Government recently opted to kick this can down the road.The private sector, meanwhile, has grumbled over being forced to contribute extra to higher education through increases to the National Training Fund.This leaves the public sector. The Government says it has invested more than €100 million this year compared to 2016. The reality, however, is that this money is simply keeping most universities standing still.Funding per inidual student has nudged upwards only slightly because most extra money has gone to paying for public sector pay increases.If there is to be a surge in investment, it is hard to see where it will come from given competing demands on the public purse.One potential answer is to boost university autonomy and relax Government restrictions. Most universities now generate the bulk of their income privately. It is questionable whether the Government should wield such authority within a sector when it is becoming a minority investor.

File photograph: Getty ImagesIrish universities have tumbled down the latest set of influential world rankings, sparking alarm among senior academics over the funding “crisis” facing higher education.Trinity College Dublin has lost its status as Ireland’s only top-100 university, while six out of eight Irish top-ranked colleges have fallen down the rankings.Senior academics say Government-imposed caps on staffing, growing student numbers and a decade of under-investment are to blame.Universities such as UCD – which previously said it would consider capping the number of Irish students – are now considering new measures to tackle the rising student per lecturing staff ratio.The QS World University Rankings show Trinity fell from 88th to 104th in the world, while UCD slid from 168th to 193rd place.NUI Galway also fell (from 243rd place to 260th), as did UCC (from 228th to 383rd place).In the capital, DCU was down (from 391st place to 422nd) along with DIT – which is categorised as a university by the rankings body – (down from the 651-700 category to the 751-800 category).The only two Irish institutions which avoided dropping were the University of Limerick (which remained in the 501-550 category) and Maynooth University (which remained in the 701-750 category).Ranking experts say the Irish sector is facing a range of challenges, with declines on key measures such as staff-student ratios, academic reputation and employer reputation.QS said that even though Irish universities have increased their research output, they have been outpaced by other universities across the globe.All Irish universities also received lower ranks for the relatively low proportions of international students.The Irish Universities Association said it had serious concerns that a continued failure to address the third-level funding crisis will directly damage the Irish economy in future years.Director-general Jim Miley said: “It’s time to stop delaying a decision on a proper funding model for Irish third-level education. The Government know what needs to be done and should now bite the bullet.”Prof Andrew Deeks, UCD president, said a continuing deterioration in the student-staff ratio – which now stands at about 20 students per single faculty member – can no longer be endured.“At a time when countries like China are investing billions into their best universities to reduce their student-teacher ratio to 10:1 and to raise their world standing, the Irish Government perseveres with austerity-level funding of Irish higher education,” Prof Deeks said.“As a direct result, Irish parents continue to pay the highest up-front fees for undergraduate education in Europe, and the standing of the Irish university system continues to decline relative to more ambitious systems.”Globally, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was named the world’s leading university for the seventh consecutive year.It was followed by US universities Stanford, Harvard, and California Institute of Technology.University of Oxford (5th place) was the top-ranking UK institution, usurping its longtime rival, the University of Cambridge (6th).Overall, both the US and UK have seen their performances stabilise, with slightly more improvements than drops.In continental Europe, the best university remained ETH Zurich (7th place).Europe, in general, also stabilised its performance, with a fractionally higher number of rises than drops.In Asia, Nanyang Technological University ranked highest (12th), while Tsinghua University is the first Chinese top-20 university in the QS rankings in more than a decade.Malaysia is home to a top-100 university for the first time, after Universiti Malaya rose to 87th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521431.1528301257!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"booze up on holiday ryanair tells students but not on our planes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn image featured in a tweet from Ryanair aimed at Leaving Cert students. Ryanair has brushed off criticism that a “reckless” tweet posted by its social media team aimed at both Leaving Cert and A-Level students was promoting binge drinking among young people.“To all #LeavingCert and #ALevel students: plan your dream summer holiday now so you have something to look forward to,” the tweet reads. It is accompanied by an image of a young man passed out on a beach beside an empty wine bottle and finishes with the closing thought that: “this could be you”.Alcohol Action Ireland spokesman Eunan McKinney criticised the airline for posing the tweet which, he said, smacked of hypocrisy.He expressed surprise that such promotional material would be endorsed by Ryanair in the same week it had called for measures to be taken at UK airports to curb excessive drinking.“It’s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights,” a Ryanair spokesman said.Mr McKinney lauded the airline for having “taken a very firm stance in supporting the health and safety of its own crew, who regrettably have to face the chaos from alcohol-fuelled passengers”, and he suggested the company “could be a little more mindful of not reinforcing the same behaviour in our youth”.He pointed to “tragic incidences, both at home and abroad, in which some young people do engage in excessive alcohol consumption in and around exam times, and pay a very high price for such risky behaviour, including with their lives”.He accused the airline of “reinforcing high-risk consumption of alcohol” among young people, who he said need “guidance, not reckless reinforcement of harmful social norms”.There was also condemnation of the tweet from social media users, with some accusing Ryanair of being irresponsible while simultaneously “encouraging binge drinking AND beach littering?”The airline rejected all criticism of the social media post. “Our social media team were merely reminiscing about their own first lads’girls’ trip away, and recalling all the wonderful sightseeing, sing-songs and cultural activities they enjoyed as teenagers,” a spokesman told The ."},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

File photograph: Gulshan KhanAFPGetty ImagesNewly appointed president Cyril Ramaphosa’s first 100 days in office have offered South Africans a glimpse of what the future could hold for a country undermined by corruption and economic stagnation.Since replacing the ousted Jacob Zuma as South Africa’s leader on February 15th last, Ramaphosa has sought to build trust in his administration as his immediate goal, rather than introduce widespread policy changes from the get-go.In an interview on May 27th with state-run radio station SABC to mark the 10-day milestone, Ramaphosa said the changes he had made so far were designed to restore people’s confidence in the country, so that the type of investment needed to create large-scale employment could be attracted.To achieve his goal, Ramaphosa has followed through on his promises to tackle government corruption and nepotism – which flourished under his predecessor – and made interventions targeted at specific sectors to support the economy.Another aspect of his turnaround strategy has been to announce an ambitious plan to secure $100 billion (€85 billion) in overseas investment that will involve holding two large summits – one on jobs and one on investment – in the near future.To set his turnaround strategy in motion, the trade unionist-turned-businessman reshuffled his cabinet at the end of February and installed trusted lieutenants in crucial government positions at the expense of many Zuma loyalists.The well-respected Nhlanhla Nene, who Zuma fired from his cabinet in 2015, was reappointed minister of finance to ensure there is a reliable hand on the nation’s purse strings. Another move of major significance saw Ramaphosa sack Mosebenzi Zwane from the position of mineral resources minister.The latter had been at the centre of numerous corruption allegations, and his introduction of the revamped Mining Charter last year had caused uproar in the industry.The charter, supposed to redress inequities in the industry created by apartheid, had prompted industry stakeholders appalled by some of its provisions around black economic empowerment to challenge it legally.Experts had warned the changes Zwane had made to the charter would undermine investment into the sector, which is a pillar of the economy, rather than promote it. The charter has since been withdrawn so that it can be revised.Last month the newly appointed public enterprise minister Pravin Gordhan, a longtime Ramaphosa ally, also announced that government had begun the process of turning around poorly performing state-owned enterprises.Power utility Eskom, airline SA Express Airways, freight and rail transport company Transnet, and weapons producer Denel, all had significant personnel changes made to their boards of directors by Gordhan.“The poor performance of these companies was a result of deep, widespread corruption and maladministration,” Gordhan said at a press conference, before adding, “This continued unabated at these companies until a few months ago. We are intent on reversing this situation.”According to a recent editorial published in South Africa’s respected Business Day newspaper, the biggest impact Ramaphosa has had on the country has been the confidence he has been able to instil in relation to his ability to reverse South Africa’s downward spiral.“Top of the confidence-building measures has been the rapid replacement of the leadership of state-owned companies. As this is where most of the risk to the economy and the rot was centred, the focus has made good sense,” the editorial said.While Zwane’s sacking was broadly welcomed locally, other ministers such as Malusi Gigaba, Nomvula Mokonyane and Bathabile Dlamini have managed to retain positions in Ramaphosa’s cabinet, despite their dubious track records.Their survival prompted the president’s critics to conclude that his hold on power in the ANC remains undermined by factionalism. Furthermore, they insist his ability to push through the type of economic policies that will be needed to turn the economy around remains precarious as a result.The main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party has called Ramaphosa’s interventions to date as “small, cosmetic changes”.“Ramaphosa is governing on a fragile, compromised mandate, and will never be able to effect the total change that will turn our nation around, eradicate corruption, create millions of jobs, make our country safe, and fix our broken education system,” insisted DA leader Mmusi Maimane in a statement.While this remains to be seen, Ramaphosa’s efforts so far have resonated with many South Africans intent on believing that he can deliver on the “new dawn” he has promised.According to a poll conducted by research company Ipsos in late May, 76 per cent of the 2,000 people surveyed said they approved of the job Ramaphosa was doing as president, and 79 per cent said they approved of how he was handling the economy.Only 6 per cent of those surveyed disapproved of his performance in government so far."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521668.1528311984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"split in uk cabinet as britain s brexit backstop plan due","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s secretary for departing the EU, David Davis. Photograph: Leon NealPool via Reuters The British government is expected to publish a proposal on Thursday for the backstop to avoid a hard border amid cabinet isions over whether it should have a time limit. Brexit secretary David Davis said the proposal still had to be signed off by a cabinet subcommittee before it could be presented to EU negotiators in Brussels.“The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. It has been through one cabinet committee, it is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation there. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive,” he said.Mr Davis said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit, would be time-limited.“I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time limit on the backstop proposal,” he said.Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman said that the backstop was necessary to fulfil the commitments the British government made to avoid a hard border in Ireland, although all sides hoped another solution would be found.“It’s important that that is time-limited, even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” the spokesman said.Before the last EU summit in March, Britain and the EU agreed that the backstop should remain in place “unless and until” another solution to keep the Border open is found and Downing Street said on Wednesday that it did not “resile” from any commitments it had made.The EU has told Britain that talks on their future trade and security relationship cannot proceed unless there is “sufficient progress” on a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which includes the Border backstop, when EU leaders meet at the end of this month. Mr Davis said on Wednesday, however, that the issue of Northern Ireland was unlikely to hold up progress.“We’re not expecting the Northern Ireland elements of this arrangement until October so I wouldn’t expect any time issue to stop progress between June and October,” he said.Fine Gael Senator and spokesman on EU affairs Neale Richmond on Wednesday night described this month’s summit as “a vital staging point in the Brexit negotiations” ahead of a meeting in October, when the negotiations are expected to be concluded.“Given the ever-looming conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, it is maddening that the British government has yet to present any detailed proposals to bring about a legal interpretation of December’s binding, political agreement,” he told a conference in London organised by the centre-right Wilfred Martens Centre. “At this stage, I say enough of the Brexit kite-flying it is time for real proposals.“The speeches given by the prime minister up to this point have been warm and made all the right noises, but they have not addressed the key issues in any sort of detail and they have not used the necessary technical language it’s been all rhetoric.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521727.1528314489!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may can t please everyone with backstop balancing act","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: the benches behind her were filled with row after row of despondent faces, Brexiteers and Remainers alike. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeBloombergSix months after Theresa May agreed to a backstop arrangement to prevent a hard border, and three weeks ahead of a crucial EU summit, she is planning to publish her proposal for the backstop on Thursday. As so often during the Brexit negotiations, however, she must first clear the hurdle of her own ministers in a cabinet subcommittee amid snarling from Brexiteers on her own backbenches.Downing Street on Wednesday insisted that the backstop will be time-limited, a key Brexiteer demand, but the prime minister has promised Brussels that the backstop will remain in place “unless and until” another solution for the Border is found. These two commitments are clearly contradictory and Brexiteers fear – probably correctly – that the backstop will only end when the EU agrees that it should.The EU’s proposed language on the backstop earlier this year envisaged it as an arrangement specific to Northern Ireland, which would remain aligned with the customs union and parts of the single market until another agreed solution to keep the Border open is found. Britain’s proposal is expected to call for the backstop to be applied to the whole of the UK, so that no new regulatory barriers are erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.EU negotiators reject the idea of a UK-wide backstop on the grounds that it amounts to cherry-picking parts of the single market without accepting the full responsibilities of membership. This special arrangement, Brussels says, can be extended to Northern Ireland because of its special circumstances but will not be available to the whole of the UK.For their part, Brexiteers fear that, unless Britain can unilaterally place a time limit on the backstop, the country will remain indefinitely in the customs union and subject to EU single market rules it will have no part in shaping. They argue that, with Britain in the customs union and subject to EU regulations for goods, the EU will have little incentive to agree a comprehensive trade deal to cover services, where Britain enjoys a trade surplus with the EU.As she faces the possibility of defeat next week on amendments to the EU withdrawal Bill at the hands of Conservative Remainers, May has succeeded in disappointing her own backbenchers on both sides of the Brexit debate.

The thing I love about it is there is something about going to places that are a world away and finding that most extraordinary thing: no matter how different the culture appears to be, underneath it all we are almost exactly the same.We love our families, we value our health and each of us want to live the most enjoyable life we can. In 2005, I travelled with Sightsavers to Bangladesh where I watched as five-year-old, Arif saw his mother for the first time after having cataracts removed.There is no more moving experience than witnessing a child having their sight saved or seeing them become free from pain or discomfort. I returned eight years later and found a happy, 13-year-old Arif attending secondary school – a far cry from the young boy who used to sit, inactive, in front of his family home.One of my strongest memories of that first trip was meeting Arif’s grandmother and seeing how worried she was about him, in exactly the same way I worry about my grandchildren. When it was all over, and the operation had been a success, we shared a hug and a blub  two grannies together.Prior to this very humbling experience, my involvement with Sightsavers started 20 years-ago when I saw a small, black and white advert in a newspaper. It was about trachoma, an excruciating eye disease that can cause irreversible blindness and mostly affects people in developing countries. The advert stopped me in my tracks.I remember being shocked at how cheap it can be to stop trachoma in its early stages and that the condition is completely preventable altogether. After seeing the advert, I learned that trachoma starts as a bacterial infection, a bit like conjunctivitis, and can be treated with a simple dose of antibiotics.The infection is spread by flies and, I think perhaps most tragically, by human touch, meaning that mothers wiping the faces of their children might accidentally pass the infection to them and vice versa. If the initial infection is left, it can turn into trichiasis, the more severe form of the disease that often requires surgery..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Trichiasis makes a person’s eyelashes turn inward so they scratch against the surface of the eye. Every single blink causes excruciating pain and eventually, blindness. It can stop children learning at school, parents from going to work, and traps whole communities in a nasty cycle of poverty – this thought shatters me.There is still a staggering number of people who are affected by trachoma in 39 countries. But thankfully in the 20 years since I first saw Sightsavers’ newspaper advert, the numbers of people affected are reducing, and more and more countries around the world are closer than ever to ending the disease for good, showing that aid works.I am very proud that the UK is playing a leading role in ending trachoma. Between 2012 and 2015, the UK government’s Department for International Development (DFID) supported the largest infectious disease mapping survey in history, the Global Trachoma Mapping Project.The project created a significant turning point in the fight to end trachoma, it revealed where exactly the disease is. This then helped to pinpoint where treatment programmes were (and in many cases still are) needed.In response, wonderful programmes such as The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust’s Trachoma Initiative stepped up to the plate. The Trachoma Initiative, which is supported by UK aid and many other governments from Commonwealth countries, work with communities themselves and a network of organisations to end trachoma.As a result of the Trachoma Initiative working in tandem with other remarkable programmes and other aid agencies like USAID, the end of trachoma is now in sight for Uganda, Mozambique and Malawi.Thanks in part, to these driven and committed donors and others like the Conrad N Hilton Foundation, globally many other countries are also making decisive progress towards ending the disease. Right now, both Ghana and Nepal are thought to be on the cusp of eliminating trachoma and other countries are not far behind.This fantastic progress has been achieved thanks to health ministries in endemic countries, communities, donors, pharmaceutical companies and members of what is known as the International Coalition for Trachoma Control. I find it inspiring to hear of the success of teamwork on an international scale.More good news is that the drive to end trachoma is growing. Recently, during the week of the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the UK’s Secretary of State for International Development, Penny Mordaunt, announced funding of £20 million that will be used to boost efforts to eliminate trachoma in 10 Commonwealth countries.This means that UK aid will help iniduals and families in Kenya, Kiribati, Nauru, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tanzania, Tonga and Vanuatu and enable them to access services that will protect them from blinding trachoma.Sightsavers will work alongside ministries of health and communities in Africa to deliver the programme and The Fred Hollows Foundation will work in Asia and the Pacific. I’m really fired up by this new programme because of the scale and speed it will reach people.Over two years, the new support from UK aid will enable 5.5 million people to access trachoma-fighting antibiotics, and provide up to 76,000 people with eyelid surgery for trichiasis to stop the pain of their eyelashes scraping against their eyes, and potentially save their sight..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Nobody, no matter their wealth or what country they live in, should go blind from a disease that can be avoidedI think also crucially, through the promotion of hygiene and sanitation practices, the new funding from UK aid will raise awareness of trachoma and how iniduals and families can protect themselves from getting it, or unknowingly pass the infection to others. Thus helping to foster healthy lifelong behaviours and practices.I’m heartened that there are other big opportunities to end trachoma on the horizon. In April at the TED2018 conference in Vancouver it was announced that Sightsavers has been chosen to be a part of the Audacious Project.Supported by leading non-profit organisations and philanthropists, the Audacious Project has selected trachoma elimination as one of the key issues that have the potential to make incredible global change and I completely agree. But to finish the job entirely and end avoidable trachoma globally, more support is needed from iniduals and organisations.At the pace we’re going, cumulatively, our efforts could mean that if we continue to push ourselves, the world will see the end of trachoma in just a few years. About time too. Nobody, no matter their wealth or what country they live in, should go blind from a disease that can be avoided, or watch a loved one endure the pain of an easily preventable condition.If we keep up this momentum, soon millions of people will finally be free of the pain, potential blindness and poverty caused by trachoma. Grannies, parents, children, and whole communities the world over really, will have something to celebrate.I first heard about trachoma from a newspaper advert and very soon I look forward to us reading the headline Trachoma eliminated globally.For more information visit sightsavers.org.ukProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Blindness and vision impairmentPlease review our commenting policyNightclub owner Peter Stringfellow dies after battle with cancer Comment: Confucius is key to China-UK friendship.

Overall, a British university graduate with 17 years of education would, on average, be at least −1 dioptre more myopic than someone who left school at 16. The difference is enough to mean needing glasses for driving.The authors of the study suggested schools should try to ensure children spent more time outdoors.Experts pointed to the experience in East Asia, where schooling means early intense educational pressures and little time for play outdoors. Half of children are short-sighted by the time they leave primary school, compared with less than 10 per cent of British children.Study author Dr Denize Atan, of Bristol University, said: This study shows that exposure to more years in education contributes to the rising prevalence of myopia, and highlights a need for further research and discussion about how educational practices might be improved to achieve better outcomes without adversely affecting vision.Given the advantages of time spent outdoors on mental health and the protection it provides against obesity and chronic diseases, we might all benefit from spending more time outside.Blindness and vision impairmentNightclub owner Peter Stringfellow dies after battle with cancer Comment: Confucius is key to China-UK friendship.

It is designed for both indoor and outdoor use meaning children could soon be riding a unicorn to school.My Lovely Unicorn also has a light up horn and comes with a hair brush for combing its long pink hair. At £49 Poopsie Unicorn Surprise is a far more affordable - but also potentially messy option. It is quite literally a unicorn that poos glitter. It looks set to be a major hit as it combines all of 2018\u0027s biggest trends (slime, glitter, unicorns and poo). Poopsie comes in four different colours and is complete with a unique bottle, glitter and a white powder which when combined together and fed to her forms the glittery unicorn poo. Unicorns are mythical creatures which date back to ancient Greek literature. It is said that anyone who touches a pure white unicorn will find happiness and joy for their entire life, while its horn will pierce the heart of a liar.Over the past year a proliferation of unicorn-themed items aimed at adults have not only become available for sale but have flown off the shelves.For example ladies wear store Topshop is currently stocking unicorn headbands, pyjamas and nail polish.Meanwhile Asos’s top selling unicorn merchandise are slippers, while at H\u0026ampM a Unicorn Fan Club T shirt is available for grown women. And in a sign that they are really peaking stationary store Paperchase’s windows tell consumers to “Be More Unicorn”, while Kellogg’s has just launched Unicorn Froot Loops, with the tagline The Magic Has Landed.Juliet Ward, Head of Toy Buying, at Argos, said: “This year’s list is arguably our most exciting and eclectic to date. Social media trends are influencing toys more than ever before, such as the unicorn craze which has inspired great products like the Vtech Fantasy Unicorn and the My Lovely Unicorn Electric Ride-On. The pocket-money-friendly collectibles craze also continues to evolve and succeed with LOL Surprise, Fingerlings and the Treasure X 3-Pack Chest all must-have toys for this year.”John Baulch, Founder of Toy World, said: “The Top Toys list for this year shows just how much toymakers are innovating and evolving to keep up with current trends, whether this be through the dominance of unicorns or the rise of technology in interactive toys like Boxer.Nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow dies after battle with cancer Comment: Confucius is key to China-UK friendship.

Log inIn a notice this week the European Commission has advised continental European businesses to think twice before using parts and components made in Britain.It’s reported that European firms\u0026nbspmight need to look elsewhere for parts if they wish to continue benefiting from EU free trade agreements with other countries such as South Korea and Mexico.But why is the commission issuing this advice? How serious are the economic implications for UK companies? And is there any way around it?It’s a direct consequence of Brexit.Leaving the EU automatically means that the UK becomes a “third country” to the bloc.When the EU did some\u0026nbsp40\u0026nbspfree trade deals with the likes of South Korea, Mexico and South Africa the agreements stipulated that any produce or manufactured good which passed between them tariff-free had to have genuinely originated in the two signatory countries or blocs.This stipulation was necessary to prevent other countries essentially free-riding on the deal. For instance, a firm in a third country could export their goods to one of the two parties to the free trade agreement and then re-export\u0026nbspgoods to the other party without paying the applicable tariffs.To prevent this happening the two countries in the deal impose “rules of origin” checks on imports. For the UK, while it’s in the EU, this is not a problem. Any UK goods pass through fine. Also, any UK components in EU goods are not a problem at all.But with the UK out of the EU’s customs union the situation is potentially very different. Rules of origin specify that a certain proportion of a good has to have been made in the country or bloc to qualify.\u0026nbspThe proportion varies with the good in question, but\u0026nbspit’s often around 50 per cent. For cars the requirement is 60 per cent.If, after Brexit, an EU business has used components sourced in the UK, that could potentially push the proportion of the exported EU good under the threshold, meaning it would fail the rule of origin requirement and be forced to pay the standard tariff.This is why the commission has issued its warning to EU firms to be wary about using UK manufactured goods if they don’t want to have a nasty surprise when they seek to export to third countries with which the EU has a trade deal.Potentially very serious, because the UK is firmly embedded in pan-European corporate supply chains. The UK sends around 44 per cent of its exports to the EU. Among the biggest categories of goods exported are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and vehicles.And research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found the share of the EU’s imports from the UK that were “intermediate” goods and services (ie components) was 69 per cent in 2014, up from 61 per cent in 2000.Not all of those imports will be baked into products and re-exported from the EU, but a fair amount will.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform think tank says that sectors which traditionally find rules of origin burdensome include textiles, food, machinery and vehicles.To give one high profile example of a UK component of an EU export, the wings of the Airbus are currently manufactured in Broughton, North Wales. They are exported and the plane is assembled in Toulouse and then sold all around the world.The natural way to solve the rules of origin problem would seem to be for the UK to form a new customs union with the EU and to “grandfather”, or roll over, the EU’s existing free trade agreements so that they are applicable to the UK, as well as the EU, after Brexit.However, both are far more easily said than done. The UK cabinet is split on what sort of long-term customs arrangement it wants to push for with the EU – and both schemes they are considering have already been rejected by the EU.There is also no guarantee the third countries will simply agree to roll over their trade agreements with the EU for the UK – some may wish to take the opportunity to reopen them.And even if they did grandfather their trade deals, as Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have pointed out, when it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well.Given all these hurdles, it would hardly be surprising if EU firms currently using UK components became nervous about these multiple deals not, ultimately, materialising.The two-year transition deal due to kick in in March 2019 should, in theory, delay the day of reckoning because it is assumed the EU will ask countries with which it has a free trade deal to treat the UK as if it is effectively still an EU member. But it cannot be taken for granted\u0026nbspthat those countries will agree to do this, adding another layer of uncertainty for Continental firms.“Faced with this uncertainty EU firms may well start to source inputs from elsewhere because they don’t want to risk not getting originating status,” says Dr Gasiorek.“This matters most where the tariffs that the EU would face on its exports are high. For some industries where supply contracts may have a long duration, I would expect this to already be an issue.”However, Alan Winters of Sussex University\u0026nbspthinks more firms will delay drastic decisions. “My sense is that there will be some re-sourcing …but a lot of these supply chain are pretty complicated and it’s quite expensive to do so, so they may wait and see,” he says.Mr Lowe points out that the incentive for the European Union side to solve the Brexit rules of origin problem might be blunted due to the fact that if EU companies do start sourcing more in the rest of the EU that’s a potential spur to growth and jobs within the bloc.Of course, the same post-Brexit rules of origin problems work in the other direction and British firms are likely to feel pressure to replace some EU-sourced components with UK-sourced ones.The Society of Motor Manufacturers, for instance, has pointed out that only around 40 per cent of the average UK-made car is currently local content, potentially complicating any future trade deals the post-Brexit UK might seek to strike.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?The Independent and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You can ask anybody who lives in the tropics – this doesn\u0027t hold true for our planet.This effect is thought to result from differences in heat distribution across the two planets.\u0026nbspWarm, moist air rising from Earth’s\u0026nbspequator fuels thunderstorms around the planet’s middle, whereas the same effect on Jupiter is created by warm gases from Jupiter\u0027s interior rising at the poles due to their lack of atmospheric stability.These discoveries could only happen with Juno, said Dr Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio.\u0026nbspOur unique orbit allows our spacecraft to fly closer to Jupiter than any other spacecraft in history, so the signal strength of what the planet is radiating out is a thousand times stronger.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While 24 per cent of the former gained entry, only 12 per cent of the latter did.“You see places as prestigious as Oxford with an exclusionary admissions strategy,” Rev Sharpton told The Independent.“Oxford can figure out the most difficult aspects of philosophy and explore the intricacies of science but\u0026nbspcan’t figure out how to get admissions of black students. It seems contradictory – how could you be so bright and so dumb at the same time?”“Ninety-five\u0026nbspper cent of the crowd was white. I told them they need to work with groups like Operation Black Vote, who I have been coming to the UK with since 1991.”Operation Black Vote is a non-partisan, non-profit national organisation that was established in 1996 to tackle the black British and ethnic minority democratic deficit. It centres its energies on voter registration, lobbying politicians and mentoring schemes.“In Oxford, out of 29 colleges, eight colleges did not have one black undergrad admitted between 2015 and 2017,” Rev Sharpton, who Mr Obama described as “the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden”, said.\u0026nbsp“Last night I said that we have the great symbolic heartwarming picture of a person of colour marrying into the royal family which we all support, but you have the undercurrent of exclusion in places like Oxford.”While about 3\u0026nbspper cent of the British population is black, according to the most recent census, only 1.9 per cent of the roughly 3,200 students admitted to Oxford in 2017 identified as black Britons.Oxford University – which has been contacted for comment –\u0026nbspadmitted it needed\u0026nbspto do more to improve student ersity after the latest figures were unearthed last month.Samina Khan, Oxford University’s director of undergraduate admissions, said the university was working hard to change.“The reason for that is that you are looking a very different applicant pools. One is very large – that is the white pool in terms of who gets three As and above (at a A-level) – and the other one is very small,” she told the Today programme.“We are not getting the right number of black people with the talent to apply to us and that is why we are pushing very hard on our outreach activity to make sure we make them feel welcome and they realise Oxford is for them.”David Lammy, Labour MP and the former higher education minister, said: “The truth is that Oxford is still a bastion of white middle-class southern privilege. That is what it is.“They have to explain why you are twice as likely to get in if you are white as if you are black and why you are more likely to get in if you are from the south than the north of England when you apply.”Earlier this year, The Independent revealed black students pursuing a place at university were 21 times more likely to have their applications investigated for suspected false or missing information than their white counterparts.\u0026nbspUcas said it was “extremely concerned” by the figures, released under freedom of information rules, and had launched an investigation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Destitution is defined as people lacking two “essential needs”, such as food or housing.The polling on food poverty, from\u0026nbspa representative sample of 1,050 UK adults carried out for The Independent by D-CYFOR,\u0026nbspsuggests that 7 per cent of the adult population – or 3.7 million people – have used a food bank to receive a meal.A million people\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbspdecreased the portion size of their child’s meal due to financial constraints, the survey says.The results come\u0026nbspafter it emerged in April that the number of emergency meals handed out at food banks had risen at a higher rate than ever, soaring by 13 per cent in a year, with more than 1.3 million three-day emergency food supplies given to people in crisis in the 12 months to March.The JRF report, carried out by Heriot-Watt University, found that among the tens of thousands of people who were recorded as being destitute last year, food was the most commonly lacked item, with 62 per cent within the group reporting that they had gone without over the past month.\u0026nbspNearly half (47 per cent) had lacked basic toiletries, with 46 per cent lacking suitable clothing and 42 per cent having to go without heating. One in five destitute people reported lacking lighting at home, and 16 per cent had recently slept rough.Margaret Greenwood, Labour’s shadow\u0026nbspwork and pensions secretary, said: “These figures are shocking. After eight years of Conservative austerity, we are seeing destitution reappearing on our streets.“Benefit delays and sanctions are among key reasons why people are forced into destitution. The sanctions rate in universal credit is well over 10 times higher than for jobseeker’s\u0026nbspallowance, yet the government is rapidly accelerating the roll out of universal credit with the risk that increasing numbers of people will be left with no alternative but to turn to food banks.”Garry Lemon, director of policy and research at the\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust, said: “These figures are deeply concerning, especially when we know that not everyone facing hunger or skipping meals goes to a food bank.\u0026nbsp“Last year our network alone provided 1.3 million supplies to people across the UK – this is just not right. If we’re to end hunger we need to go to the root of why people are struggling to stay above water, and ensure that adequate financial support is in place whenever its most needed.”The JRF report highlighted that a reduction in benefit sanctions between 2015 and 2017 saw levels of destitution decline by around 25 per cent over this period, but warned of a “real risk” that this would unravel as universal credit is embedded across the country, prompting another spike in sanctions.Benefit sanctions, which take the form of docking a portion of benefit payments for a period of time, can be imposed for breaching benefit conditions like not attending a work placement, or for being minutes late for a jobcentre appointment.They have been widely criticised in recent years after it emerged claimants had been docked hundreds of pounds and pitched into financial crisis for often trivial breaches of benefit conditions, or for administrative errors beyond their control.Recent government figures show that almost half (49 per cent) of all universal credit decisions resulted in a benefit sanction – up 12 percentage points from August 2017 to October 2017.\u0026nbspCampbell Robb, chief executive of JRF, said: “Many of us rely on public services such as social security when hit with unexpected circumstances like job loss, relationship breakdown or ill health.\u0026nbsp“Yet actions by government, local authorities and utility companies are leading to ‘destitution by design’: forcing people into a corner when they are penniless and have nowhere to turn. This is shameful.“Social security should be an anchor holding people steady against powerful currents such as rising costs, insecure housing and jobs, and low pay, but people are instead becoming destitute with no clear way out.”Mr Campbell said the reduction in benefit sanction rates had meant some headway has been made, but warned there was a “real risk” that once universal credit is embedded across the country, more people could again be at risk unless changes are made.A DWP spokesperson said: “Work is the best route out of poverty and our welfare reforms incentivise employment while having the right support in place for those that need it.\u0026nbspUniversal credit lies at the heart of our commitment to improve lives, and it is seeing people move into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\u0026nbsp“This report fails to take this into account, nor the recent improvements we have made to universal credit, including continuing to pay two weeks’ housing costs for claimants moving onto UC, removing the seven waiting days, increasing advance payments to 100 per cent per cent and extending repayment times to 12 months.“Since 2010, one million people have been lifted out of absolute poverty and employment is at a record high, with 1,000 people moving into work every day. Meanwhile, we continue to spend £90bn a year on welfare to support those who need it most.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A car industry executive told the broadcaster that the change was a “catastrophe” for the car industry.“The hard Brexiteers have built a bomb under the UK automotive industry and the EU have lit it,” they said.Exit from the customs union and the subsequent changes to rules of origin are also likely to be disruptive for British businesses in other ways. UK exporters selling into the EU under any future free trade agreement would have to prove they originate from the UK, which can be a costly and bureaucratic procedure, reducing the competitiveness of British goods compared to EU ones. UK businesses that use components sourced from outside the EU may also not gain preferential access if they are found to be mostly worked on elsewhere.In most cases, a manufacturer needs to show that around 55 per cent of its value was created in the EU. The rules, which are a standard feature of all trade agreements across the world, are in place to stop countries re-exporting goods produced elsewhere on favourable terms.Staying in the EU customs union would remove all of these issues because the UK would continue to coordinate its trade policy with the EU.Commenting on the new warning, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said: “Preferential rules of origin were the subject of my very first meeting on my very first day in the European Commission back in 1994. They have not become any simpler since.”A UK government spokesperson said: “This is simply dealing with what would happen in a ‘no deal’\u0026nbspscenario.“We are in the process of discussing our future partnership with the EU, and in March we reached agreement on the terms of an implementation period that will start on 30 March 2019 and last until 31 December 2020, which will see our market access continue on current terms.“A clear priority is to maintain continuity in our relationships with third countries as we exit the EU, and we’ve agreed with the EU that they will notify the other parties to international agreements that, during the implementation period, the United Kingdom is to be treated as a member state for the purposes of these agreements.“This is in line with the draft withdrawal agreement text published before March European Council.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If they conclude then you’ll see it tomorrow, but it’s up to them to decide.”He added: “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. it’s been through one cabinet committee, it’s going to another and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiations there, but I suspect it will be fairly decisive.”Some reports had suggested Mr Davis\u0026nbspwas considering resigning over disagreements with Ms May on the matter.Asked if he would be able to stay in his job if the backstop proposal was published without his approval, the Brexit secretary said: “That’s a question, I think, for the prime minister, to be honest.”He also insisted there would be a time limit on the backstop option, saying: “The prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put\u0026nbspa time limit on the backstop proposal.”The government is under mounting pressure to publish\u0026nbspdetails of its Brexit plans ahead of crunch votes on its flagship EU (Withdrawal) Bill next week\u0026nbspand a European Council meeting in three weeks’ time.The UK needs to ensure sufficient progress has been made on sticking points such as the Northern Irish border in order to allow talks to progress to the matter of a UK-EU trade deal.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The bill seeks to restrict the fees that landlords and letting agents are allowed to impose\u0026nbspon tenants.Melanie Onn, Labour\u0027s shadow housing minister, said: Labour is fighting for a fairer deal for all renters.We recognise the private rented sector is the fastest growing area of housing, and it is right that they are not exploited by unfair fees.This government has failed renters for the last eight years. Labour will hold them to account to make sure the power between landlords and tenants is rebalanced.According to the government’s impact assessment for the Tenant Fees Bill, the average rental deposit stood at £1,161 as of\u0026nbsplast March. It has risen from £979 in 2012 -\u0026nbsp a19 per cent increase in five years.The document admits: “In many cases the amount of deposit taken is much greater.”It continues: “As with letting fees, tenants are often forced to accept the terms of the deposit as set out by the landlord otherwise they will risk losing the property. Tenants can therefore be required to pay unreasonable deposits that are incommensurate with the landlord’s risk.“Tenants have little bargaining power to influence this level of deposit, which is further indication that the lettings market is not functioning in accordance with true market forces.“Government intervention in the form of a cap on tenancy deposits at six\u0026nbspweeks’ rent is necessary to ensure that the level of deposit required by landlords is financially manageable for tenants and commensurate with the landlord’s financial risk. This will result in the money being available to tenants to spend, leading to wider economic benefits.Three in four private renters are asked to pay a deposit when moving to a new property. On\u0026nbspaverage they\u0026nbsphave only 77 per cent of the sum returned to them.The government has been contacted for comment.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It said the government had triggered the Argentinian cancellation through its own actions.“Turning the game into a political event caused its cancellation,” Zuheir Bahloul, a member of the Knesset from the Zionist Union party and a former football commentator, told The Independent.In particular, the right-wing culture and sports minister, Miri Regev, had erred in moving the venue from the northern city of Haifa, which was Argentina’s preferred locale to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its “eternal, unided” capital but whose eastern part Palestinians envision as their own future capital.The issue has become all the more charged since the US last month moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, infuriating Palestinians.Ms Regev also depicted the friendly as linked to the 70th\u0026nbspanniversary celebrations of Israeli statehood.“The moment the Argentinians saw that the game was taking on a political colouring they got cold feet,” Mr Bahloul said.“The result is that the fans, including myself, lost out on the visit of the prophet of the religion of football, a very special prophet\u0026nbspwho, with his team, did not make it to the holy land.”The Palestinian campaign was led by Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Football Association, who on Sunday called on Arab and Muslim fans to burn pictures and T-shirts of Messi if he attended the friendly.The Israeli government blamed antisemitic elements for the fiasco.Avigdor Lieberman, the hard-right defence minister, wrote on Twitter: “It is a shame that the football nobility from Argentina didn’t withstand the pressure of the inciters and haters of Israel whose only goal is to harm our basic right to self-defence and bring about the destruction of Israel. We will not surrender in the face of a group of antisemites and terror supporters.”Ms Regev blamed Argentina’s decision on “terror groups that began sending messages to players and their families with clear threats to harm their lives and those of their children. Among other things, films and pictures of children’s bodies were sent to the players.”Fans were ided over who to blame for the cancellation.“This happened because of the inappropriate politicisation by minister Miri Regev. We actually deserve this punishment for injecting politics too much into sports,” said pensioner Shmuel Einhar, an Israeli Arsenal fan.Matvey Barsukov, 42, a health worker, disagreed, saying:\u0026nbsp“Argentina should not have caved into the pressure of BDS.

Argentina made a mistake and it’s a shame.”Palestinians were elated by Argentina’s move.PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat said Argentina, its people and team had upheld international law in the face of Israeli violations including killings of innocent Palestinians along the Gaza border.The Argentinian decision “means the world doesn’t surrender to state terrorism, robbery and threats that are implemented by the Israeli government and backed by US President Donald Trump.“The international community won’t surrender to the actions of the Israeli government and its crimes against the Palestinian people.”Israel says its use of force against Palestinian demonstrators is necessary to prevent a penetration of its border that would endanger nearby communities.Fadi Quran, Ramallah-based senior campaigner for the Avaaz online activist network, said: “Argentina’s decision has brought a spark of hope to millions of Palestinians who felt forgotten.“From Palestine we say thank you Argentina for taking a moral stance and reminding the world that Palestinian lives matter.”Mr Quran dismissed Israeli assertions that Argentina’s move came about because of threats to players, saying Avaaz had worked closely with BDS and encouraged 200,000 members in Argentina and Spain to send messages to the Argentinian Football Federation demanding withdrawal from the match.“We got the message to them that they were being played by the Israeli government and they bravely took the right position.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn\u0027s condition did not sufficiently improve.Severe medical problems in her family led her to develop an interest in science and medicine.Her older brother died from tuberculosis and another suffered from a prolonged chronic illness.When she graduated in 1925 she knew she wanted to become a doctor and completed a residency at P\u0026ampS in 1937.The doctor was the first woman to become a professor at the prestigious Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeon in 1949.The American anesthesiologist would have been celebrating her 109th birthdayDr Apgar was persuaded to go into anesthesiology by P\u0026ampS Chairman Dr Allen Whipple.Whipple felt the scientific discipline needed advancing and she had the \u0026ldquoenergy and ability to help it.The Apgar score is a way of measuring the health of a baby right after birth and is still used in many hospitals in the US today.She gave thousands of babies scores during the 1950s as the rate of infant mortality in the US began to climb.By the 1960s the technique was the main shorthand for recording a child\u0026rsquos health.Severe medical problems in her family led her to develop an interest in science The doctor travelled widely and gave lectures across the US.Virginia also published over 60 scientific articles and became well-known in the study of birth defects \u0026ndash teratology.She also co-wrote the 1972 book Is My Baby All Right? which explained the causes and treatment of common birth defects.The doctor was given three honorary doctorates during her career rom the Women\u0027s Medical College of Pennsylvania, Mount Holyoke College and the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry.But she maintained a variety of interests throughout her busy career.These included fishing, stamp collecting and flying lessons in her fifties.She never married and died of cirrhosis of the liver on August 7, 1974."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

The legal limit for a pilot is 20mg.Monaghan today appeared at Crawley Magistrates Court to plead guilty to the reporting for duty as a pilot when his level of alcohol was over the prescribed limit.Emlyn Jones, defending, said his client drank the booze well in advance of the eight-hour alcohol rule - known as bottle to throttle.Mr Jones told the court: He was not due to take up his responsibilities as pilot of the plane on take-off.He would not have been charged with taking up the role of pilot until three- and-a-half hours into the flight.Mr Jones told the court Monaghan had been on a overnight flight as a passenger the night before, and had spent the day without food or sleep.He added: He turned up for work appalled, astonished and horrified that he was still over the limit.Mr Jones said his client was only a fraction over the drink-drive limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood, and that Monaghan was not falling over drunk and no harm was caused.This was rejected by chair of the bench Dr David Wiggins, who said: I have to say the comparison to drink-driving is somewhat spurious in these circumstances.A pilot in a Boeing 777 is somewhat different from driving on the road, so we are completely ignoring that comment.Asking for the court to consider sentencing Monaghan on Wednesday, Mr Jones, said: He has thrown away the only career he has ever known.He has been a pilot his whole life, and that has gone.Sending the case to crown court, Dr Wiggins told the ex-pilot: I think you need to prepare yourself there is a very, very high chance that it will be an immediate custodial sentence.The 12-hour flight, from Gatwick to Mauritius, was scheduled to leave at 8.20pm, but the plane was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot.Monaghan is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on June 12.A spokeswoman for British Airways said: This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is always our top priority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Lords1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"peers given telling off for looking like theyre having a snooze in the chamber","story":"A shirty memo from the Governments chief whip in the Lords has been sent around complaining that the high standards of the upper chamber are not being met.Some older members of the House of Lords are regularly seen to be resting their eyes during debates - and several MPs have suffered from the snoozes in the Commons too.Lord Taylor of Holbeach wrote in an email to Tory peers: It has been observed by members of our House that, over recent months, conduct in the chamber has not been of the standard we should expect.He goes on to list a string of offences, including falling asleep in the chamber, audible conversations, and shouting from their seats, The Times reported.The grievances have also been circulated with their opposition members on the Labour and Lib Dem benches too.One Labour source confirmed they would be reminded of the rules.

But it’s up to them to decide.”On whether he will walk out of the Cabinet, the Brexit Secretary added: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister”.But Mrs May was said to have already despatched the proposal’s blueprint to Brussels to be presented to EU negotiators today.Hitting back at Mr Davis, a senior No10 source said: “We have to put something to Brussels that is negotiable, not something that will be thrown out by them immediately.“If we don’t, our Remain backbenchers next week will take it as their excuse to vote the lot of it down.”In another act of defiance, it also emerged last night that Mr Davis refused to present the backstop plan today when it is published, leaving No10 forced to approach other minister to do the PR job.Mr Davis had been scheduled to publish the plans for the backstop on Thursday but it is now likely to be launched by Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, instead.The PM also faced embarrassment in PMQs yesterday when she was unable to tell Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn when the government’s full white paper on Brexit will be published.Mr Davis is also locked in a bitter row with Mrs May after she delayed publication of the blueprint until next month, after a crucial EU summit on June 28.And she was harangued during the tense Commons session by angry Tory backbenchers, including MP Henry Smith who demanded: “Please can we have some delivery”.A former Tory leader also told Mrs May she must issue an ultimatum to the EU to press on with trade talks immediately or Britain will prepare to walk away.Leading Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith has issued his gravest warning yet that time is running out fast to cut a good Brexit deal, with just nine months to go before the UK’s exit.Heaping blame on Brussels negotiators for dictating the slow pace, Mr Duncan Smith called for Mrs May to enforce “a change to the way we are negotiating”.He added: “I think we have to arrive at the June council and say we have to do trade now and if we don’t, and if you don’t want to start the trade discussions, then we really have to say we are planning and will continue to plan to leave without a deal”.The former Tory boss also admitted there may be massive queues at Dover if a good deal is not struck, and ministers must urgently start preparing for the potential chaos there too.Labour’s Shadow Brexit Minister added: “It hardly instils confidence in the Government’s approach to Brexit when it’s supposed key negotiator is openly talking about resigning.“David Davis should stop worrying about his own job and start taking action to protect the jobs of the British people.”No10 was also accused of showing the backstop blueprints to Remain fans like Chancellor Philip Hammond over the weekend while Leavers such as BoJo and Michael Gove only got them yesterday, The Times reported.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its like your body wants to dispel this thing stuck to you and your body goes into push overdrive.”At the age of 51, Susan was told a urinary incontinence procedure would achieve her wish of being able to enjoy dancing.Instead she left Torquays Mount Stuart Hospital and endured pain so excruciating she thought she was going to die.The now 60-year-old said: I woke up after the surgery and thought I was going to die.The shock was so immense that I got into a brain fog. It was quite bizarre.I was in hospital for three days instead of 24 hours. I was not able to empty my bladder and had an infection. They struggled to put a catheter in.Susan was diagnosed with an engorged bladder and pelvic hematoma as a result of bleeding lacerations during and after the gynecological surgery.In 2010, a year after the first surgery Susan chose to close her business, and her partner left her.She has since been in and out of hospital with doctors revealing a large proportion of mesh still remains inside her body.She said: Suddenly I went from being a happy, pretty businesswoman to an unhappy woman with vagina and urinary problems which he couldnt cope with.That was another trauma I had to deal with.Whats misleading is surgeons call it tape but its still mesh. It fuses into your body and sticks like glue.I can feel the mesh burning inside me like a chemical burn and cuts like a cheese wire.Vaginal mesh implants is a common treatment in the UK for women who experience pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence.This means they suffer from leaking urine when they cough or sneeze, or have difficulty having sex.Typically those who seek treatment for this are over the age of 50 who have had several children, are overweight or suffered a vaginal tear.Around 1.500 people undergo vaginal mesh implants every year in the UK.Complications associated with vaginal meshes have been reported to the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Complaints include persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.Problems are usually caused by the mesh eroding and breaking down into smaller pieces which move.Its normally felt during sex by the woman or her partner.The only way of getting it out would be open abdominal surgery, and as far as I know no one is prepared to take it out due to the fact that it is stuck.Susan says she believes she will never get any financial compensation, despite the loss of her business and half of her property.I want an apology I think everyone deserves one who has had the mesh, she said.Due to my urinary incontinence I now live reclusively and I live for my daughters.I dont feel suicidal now. I feel sad for the loss of the woman I was and I have come to terms with the woman I am now. Thats my new goal and its not easy.Her youngest daughter Natalie said: To hear your mother wail in pain day in and day out, and to have to see her on such a reduced personal level, as she was unable to go to the toilet without assistance left me in shock, not only because I felt like I had become a parental figure at such a young age, but also that such derogatory harm could be caused to my wonderful mum.No one was available from Mount Stuart Hospital for a comment, and it remains unconfirmed whether the hospital still uses TVT mesh for urinary incontinence procedures.Earlier this year, around 800 women allegedly sought legal action against botched vaginal mesh implants which left them unable to walk or have sex without being in severe pain.Thousands more were reportedly forced to have their implants removed because of complications.Draft guidelines from health watchdog Nice say the implants should not be used for routine operations.They can cut into the vagina and women have described constant and horrific pain, leaving them unable to walk, work or have sex."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411420484.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"football fan lego stadiums record","story":"Jules Richards, 45, spent 3½ years putting together the grounds and used 160,000 bricks.He began in 2015 with his beloved Cardiff City’s stadium — and was then asked by a Sheffield Wednesday fan to create a Hillsborough.Each of the one 15 inch by 15 inch models took about 10 hours to complete.His version of Barnsley’s Oakwell stadium now sits in the League One club’s boardroom.And Wolves have one of Jules’ creations on display in their main entrance at Molineux.Jules, of Luton, said: “I’ve always liked Lego as a kid and it’s continued from there.

Some new road laws have already come into place, with more set to change the way we look after our vehicles later this year. We\u0027ve joined forces with the experts at Halfords to round up the essential bits of information all drivers need to know. So read on to stay up to date with the latest updates to British laws with this essential guide.  1. Learners can use the motorway now   For the first time learner drivers are allowed to take lessons on the motorway. Instructors must be properly licensed and have dual controls. This law should help learners become better prepared for driving on high speed roads - making our motorways safer. This follows a change in December which saw using a sat nav form part of the driving test. This was partly introduced because around a quarter of accidents involving new drivers are caused by them being distracted trying while using one. Tip: For added peace of mind, fit a dashcam. While they won\u0027t prevent an accident, investing in one can offer peace of mind. Having one means that if something were to happen, you\u0027d have video evidence to back up your version of events. Because of this, they can even be used to lower your insurance premium. The Garmin 55 Dash Cam, above, is excellent, can wirelessly send footage to your phone and has amazing, better-than-HD quality video and superb low-light performance. 2. Your diesel must be clean  The quest to clean up diesel continues as MOTs are expanded to check particulate filters. If your car produces any visible smoke during the MOT then it will fail. Similarly if your particulate filter has been tampered with then you will also fail. Make sure your diesel is running well and as cleanly as possible before your test. Tip: Some diesel problems are complicated, but make sure your car has the right oil levels and is using the correct oil. Use the Halfords Oil Finder to pick the right oil for your car - or pop in to your local Halfords store for advice from their expert staff. You can also check the Halfords MOT Advice or book an MOT at a Halfords Autocentre.  3. There are penalties for driving in the wrong motorway lane   Smart motorways have lanes which can be opened and closed via electronic signs on the overhead gantry. This allows for better traffic flow during peak times by using the hard shoulder for additional capacity. If, however, you ignore the signs when a lane is closed you will be liable for a fixed penalty of \u0026pound100 and three points. On many motorways you\u0027ll be automatically photographed if you break this rule and you\u0027ll get a fine as well as notice of penalty points in the post. Tip: A sat nav won\u0027t help with smart motorways, but they can alert you to possible traffic delays and reroute you. And with lifetime map updates, the Garmin Drive, above, is a great way to navigate.  4. Low tyre pressure is now an MOT fail  Before you go to your MOT make sure you\u0027ve checked your tyre pressures are correct. MOT testers are on the lookout for tyres that are underinflated and aside from that it\u0027s important for safety to make sure your tyres are correctly inflated.  Tip: Make sure you have a tyre pressure checker at home so you can keep an eye on your tyres. A footpump or electric pump is a great way to keep tyres at the right pressure. 5. It\u0027s very easy to fail an MOT for a broken car bulb - get a Free Car Check to make sure they\u0027re working As many as 30 per cent of MOT fails are because of lighting or signalling problems. So make sure your horn works and walk around the car checking all the lights – make sure the car is parked safely and the handbrake is on first, or you can reverse up against a wall to check brake and reverse lights.  Tip: Halfords FREE Car Check will ensure your car bulbs are all working as they should. The check also includes:  Wiper Blades Check Car Bulb Check Battery Check Engine Oil Check Windscreen Chip Check Plus a FREE Screenwash Top Up  Just pop in to a store or book online now. 6. Headlight washers are crucial now  It might seem odd, but if your car has headlight washers fitted, and was registered after September 2009, then they must work. Tip: Halfords will top up your screen wash for free as part of the Free Car Check. The MOT also requires your wipers be fully working, and Halfords can check those too. There’s more info on wiper blades here.  7. In three years you\u0027ll need working daytime lights "},{"url":null,"title":"tory david davis wont rule","story":"NewsDavid Davis won\u0027t rule out quitting as Brexit Secretary as Tories\u0027 Europe splits burst into the openThe Tory Brexit Secretary suggested the Prime Minister may be forced to fire him if he fails to support her blueprint for a customs “backstop”\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor18:48, 6 JUN 2018Updated21:28, 6 JUN 2018News (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCabinet Brexit splits burst into the open tonight as David Davis refused to rule out quitting and Theresa May prepared for a fierce backlash to her latest withdrawal plan. Mr Davis suggested the Prime Minister may be forced to fire him if he fails to support her blueprint for a customs “backstop”. Ministers were battling to agree details of a fall-back option for the Northern Ireland border until they can find a better solution.  In the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn tore into the Prime Minister, comparing her Brexit strategy to the chaos and shambles gripping Britain’s railways.  The Government’s proposals for a customs backstop - aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland - could be published as soon as tomorrow.  The document is expected to set out a time-limited arrangement under which the UK would remain within parts of the customs union, if negotiators are unable to agree a better plan for the frontier. Mr Davis told the Royal United Services Institute think tank tonight: “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. “It has been through one Cabinet committee, it is going to another one and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation there, but I suspect it will be fairly decisive tomorrow.” Asked if he could stay in his job if the Government’s proposals did not have his approval, Mr Davis said: “That’s a question I think for the Prime Minister, to be honest.” Speaking about future security ties with Brussels, he blasted Brussels over its threats to kick Britain out of the Galileo satellite programme the UK has helped fund.  “The Commission’s position seems to be shooting itself in the foot just to prove the gun works,” he said. Earlier, Mr Corbyn rattled the PM as he went on the attack over her bungling of negotiations. Likening the Government’s EU withdrawal approach to Northern trains, the Labour leader told MPs she has “delivered more delays and more cancellations” than the franchise. He fumed: “The Government’s white paper is delayed, its customs proposals have been cancelled and it has ripped up its own timetable - just like our shambolic, privatised railways. “This Government’s incompetence threatens our economy, businesses, jobs and our communities. “So, my question to the Prime Minister is this - which will last longer, the Northern rail franchise or her premiership?” However, Mr Corbyn repeatedly refused to rule out a second Brexit referendum, leaving some Labour Brexit-supporting MPs dismayed.  Later, Mrs May met Norwegian PM Erna Solberg in No 10, six days before a crunch parliamentary showdown on the Tories’ flagship Brexit Bill. While Norway is not in the EU, some MPs believe its relationship with Brussels should be mirrored by Britain, including signing up to the European Economic Area. Mr Corbyn triggered anger among Labour MPs by refusing to back staying in the EEA when MPs vote on the demand next week. Critics claim he has missed a chance to defeat the Government, which has ruled out membership.

It\u0027s because she is one of the few people in the world with no fingerprints - which has led to problems at airports. It\u0027s interesting when you try to go to America and they try and take your fingerprints and you say you haven\u0027t got any, said Heather. I went to New York with my mum in 2005 and it was our turn to show our passports. Mum did her fingerprints and when it came to me I said \u0027I don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027.

Heather was born a \u0027butterfly child\u0027 - a term given to children with a rare condition that makes the skin so fragile it\u0027s compared to the wings of a butterfly.  She has had no skin on her back for 21 years and gets up every morning knowing the day ahead involves hours of bandage changes to protect her open wounds. She regularly wakes up with new blisters that have grown overnight like bubblewrap and need to be popped with sterilised needles. And her daily routine involves attaching a tube to her stomach that feeds her for 10 hours as she sleeps at night. Heather also has to put a lens in her right eye every day after an infected blister ate away at her own in 2007, forcing her to have a corneal transplant. But despite her struggles, she remains incredibly defiant. It affects my life from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to bed, she said. I get the odd comments when I\u0027m out on the streets like \u0027urgh\u0027 but it\u0027s ignorance. She added: On bad days I\u0027m grumpy and I cry. I don\u0027t do anything, I just cry and think \u0027why me?\u0027  There are days when I want to give up. But then I have to have to accept it and have a reality check as it could be worse. Heather\u0027s mum Wendy was shocked and heartbroken when her baby emerged with no skin on her left hand or right foot, and doctors explained her condition. Heather has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a skin disorder that causes it to become very fragile and creates painful blisters with any trauma or friction. The life-limiting condition also means she gets blisters inside her eyes and down her throat - a terrifying reality as it means her throat can close over and she needs surgery to open it out again. My back is red raw Research has shown that people with some types of EB face a hugely increased risk of an aggressive and ultimately fatal form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, according to the charity DEBRA, which supports people with the disorder and their families. They say it tends to occur at sites of increased blistering and scarring but research into the precise link between skin cancer and EB is ongoing.  Heather, from Swindon, has had the disease six times in the last two years.  She has recently had an operation to remove skin affected by cancer on her neck and has this month been given the all clear - for now. She says EB is the biggest condition no one has ever heard of - yet it shapes her life and means she plans her every move meticoulously. Growing up she has learnt to cope with staring, people complaining about her being in hot tubs and pools, accusations that her mum has let her get sunburnt, and struggles to be intimate in relationships. But Heather is unafraid of EB, is determined to raise awareness of it and help DEBRA.Explaining her condition to Mirror, Heather said: I haven\u0027t got any skin on my back, it\u0027s been open since I was six and has never healed in 21 years.  My back is red raw and sometimes it’s described as looking like a piece of liver. It’s sore and very itchy. I’m not supposed to scratch it, but I do sometimes which blisters and rips it. My hands are one of the worst areas, I don’t have any nails from where the skin on my hands has retracted - that\u0027s why they\u0027re so small. I also don\u0027t have any fingerprints. People are shocked and laugh, saying I could rob a bank. My arms don’t go straight because of the creases and scarring I have that restricts the skin. My feet are also different sizes - my right is a child size 12 and my left is an adult size 3. EB affects my skin internally and externally. I even get blisters in my eyes.  EB is life limiting, and it usually kills at quite a young age. With dystrophic there isn\u0027t an average age for life expectancy, it depends, everybody is different. Before Heather was born, her mum had no idea she would have EB. It was only when she came out with no skin on her left hand and right foot - which eventually healed on their own- that doctors diagnosed her. The charity DEBRA supported Wendy, 64, and put her in touch with parents of other sufferers so she could make sense of her daughter\u0027s condition. It was shocking for my mum, Heather said, revealing what she\u0027s learnt about her childhood. She’s told me I used to scream throughout the dressing changes.  It was horrible and heartbreaking for my mum when I\u0027d cry. As a child, mum wanted me to be as independent as possible but wanted to protect me as well. I couldn’t just go out with my friends because I needed help with my wheelchair. I used to swim but I just can’t anymore because my back just hurts too much. When Heather was six she had a gastronomy peg - a feeding tube - put into her stomach because she only weighed two and a half stone. She has used it every night since and it gives her a litre of a special ‘milk’ which contains the fibres, vitamins and minerals she needs to survive. Dr Helen Philips, Global Head of Medical Affairs for Amryt Pharma, said: “It’s estimated that there are more than 500,000 people living with EB worldwide, including around 2,000 people managed in specialist centres in the UK.  EB can be overwhelming and psychologically devastating to live with for both children and their carers.  Parents regularly find themselves as their child’s nurse and main carer, having to go through the difficult routine of changing bandages and dressing wounds while watching their child suffer with intolerable pain.  While significant advancements have been made in the development of therapies aimed at correcting the underlying genetic defects seen in EB, with the expectation that a cure for the disease will be developed in the long term, currently there is no cure for the condition.  Current wound care management involves daily or regular dressing changes to protect the skin, encourage healing and prevent infection.  Depending on disease severity, dressing changes can take several hours each day, often requiring the use of prescription medications to manage their excruciating pain.  The greatest need of those living with EB, and their carers, is to access better ways to manage the daily consequences of their condition, especially their wounds which are often associated with unbearable itch, pain and frequently become infected.  A cure is definitely something to aspire to achieving but short-term solutions are a priority – it is about the ‘here and now’.” As this tube goes into her stomach, she must lie on her back - and the constant friction between the bedsheets and her skin is why her back has never healed. \u2028Her neck is also affected and “anywhere that can rub, including the creases of my elbows, the backs of my legs where I sit down, my hips and armpits, Heather says. The friction from seams of clothing or anyone bumping into her when she\u0027s out can cause blisters or rip the skin off. There are days when I want to give up The young woman also has a restrictive oesophagus and narrow throat so has to be careful with what she eats. She is able to digest soft food but scratchy or chewy foods - for example crisps or steak- can scar her throat and cause it to contract. Until now, she\u0027s had six operations to release her throat after it has tightened.  Heather\u0027s mum helps her with the process of changing any bandages that need re-dressing and to pop any blisters. She applies treatment creams in the morning and has medication to control the pain throughout the day. The morning changes only take about 20 minutes, she says. But every evening her entire back is re-bandaged, a process which takes about two hours. She also has to put her eye drops in as part of her routine.  Heather, who has had several administrative jobs in the past but is currently focusing on her treatment, says: A blister breaks down into a wound - if I don’t feel it, it can be two or three times the size by the morning. If they rip, they need to be dressed. “It’s like bubble wrap, when you pierce it, it deflates. “I wouldn’t get to sleep without my medication, it puts me in a relaxed state. But I still get pain throughout the night. Doing the bandages is part of my daily life. I\u0027ve never known anything different. It\u0027s painful but I\u0027m used to the pain. It\u0027s just physically and mentally exhausting It\u0027s never going to change so I can\u0027t mope - it\u0027s not going to heal it. Throughout the day, Heather says she needs somebody with her to help with her wheelchair. She is able to walk around the house but for longer distances uses her chair. She has to plan outings around dressing changes, and is limited to only going away with people who she knows, trusts and can help with her routine.  Heather says one of the things she\u0027s had to deal with is people staring and making complaints about her. When I was younger on holiday people would tut and assume my mum had let me get sunburnt, she revealed. One complaint that sticks in my head was on a trip to Florida in 2009. There was a couple in the hot tub and after we got in, they got out. The manager then came and said to my mum \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her, maybe she shouldn\u0027t be in a hot tub\u0027. But my mum explained I was more likely to catch something from others than the other way round. It really hurt- to have somebody complain that I could be contagious was so hurtful. When I was 13 someone complained about me being in a pool in Spain as well which was so hurtful, she added. My mum carried leaflets in different languages on holiday to give to people and explained to children that I was born with poorly skin but that I was going to have it for life but that it’s OK.  Mum is incredible, I think that\u0027s where I get my strength from.  Heather has several other people who help her including her best friend Carly, Lorraine who is like her \u0027second mum\u0027 and her first friend Nikii. She is currently single but has had relationships in the past, although she says maintaining them has been difficult. Heather explained: The last one ended as I feel it was too much to deal with. EB is a massive part of my life and expecting somebody to bring that into their day to day life is quite a big thing. In relationships, the intimacy is difficult because I\u0027m not comfortable with my body. I\u0027m not dying. I\u0027m still incredibly fit The thing Heather finds most difficult to deal with though is the regular occurrence of skin cancer. She has had 15 operations in the last two and a half years after biopsies on lumps, abnormal scabs and blisters showed she had cancer on her right knee, right hand, her neck and her foot. The last surgery was on her neck at the start of this month, and she\u0027s relieved to have been given the all-clear.

His antics were filmed as he attached a camera to his helmet and recorded their startled reactions across London, shocking passersby and even making one woman spill her coffee. A group of several young men are given a huge fright as they wandered into a bike lane while other offending pedestrians are given similar shocks across locations in central London. The approach has had a decidedly mixed response - with one man strolling in a cycle lane lashing out and striking the lycra-clad vigilante in anger.  The rider is believed to have used a Fire Chief air horn, which manufacturers say can reach up to 120 decibels – roughly similar to the noise of a jet taking off. Reckless Bradley, who uploaded the video, wrote on YouTube : “I am fed up with people walking in the cycle lane in London. Its like they don\u0027t even care that is there.

Matthew Hayden was mown down and hit over the head with a golf club in a brutal unprovoked attack. With a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain, the scared 17-year-old called his parents, thinking it could be his last ever phone call. Matthew’s parents, who asked not to be named, have now made an emotional appeal for information and revealed more details about the shocking incident which took place in Rochdale, Greater Manchester in the early hours of Saturday. They have also released photographs of Matthew after the attack. His mum and dad told the Manchester Evening News that after Matthew was hit with the golf club, the driver of the car - a Nissan Micra - tried to run him over a second time.  Despite his injuries, he managed to roll away into a driveway. Matthew’s parents thanked ‘brave’ nurses from a nearby care home who they believe saved their son’s life by giving him first aid. Matthew’s mum said: “We got the call that every parent never wants to get. “Matthew rang us saying he was dying. He said ‘I love you, but I’m going’, then his phone cut off and we didn’t even know where he was.” A black Nissan Micra rammed into the back of a Vauxhall Corsa, in which Matthew was a passenger, at a roundabout. When Matthew, a prop forward who plays for Littleborough RUFC, got out of the Corsa, he was hit by the Micra, flipping him over the bonnet and roof. He was then attacked with a nine iron golf club.  Matthew’s friend and fellow rugby player Josh Jones, 18, who was driving the Corsa, suffered injuries to his hand and his face when another one of the offenders smashed the car window with a metal object, believed to be a crowbar. Another friend, Zac Madden, who was also a passenger in the car, managed to escape unharmed. Police, who are treating the incident as a hate crime, said that during the attack the group of four or five Asian males hurled racial abuse at Matthew and his friends. The day before the attack, Matthew, an engineering apprentice, learned he had been accepted on a four-year rugby scholarship at a American university. He won’t be able to accept the offer following the attack - and he may never play rugby again. Matthew’s dad said: “He had promising rugby career in front of him and they have taken his hopes and dreams away from him. “They have ruined a young man’s life for mindless violence. “Matthew is just so frustrated. He knows what they have done. He told us ‘they’ve ruined my life’.  “After the call cut out a nurse called us back. “We got to him as quickly as we could and it was just horrendous. There was blood everywhere. “There were three nurses looking after him, giving him first aid. They were very brave, we owe them so much.” Matthew underwent an emergency four-hour operation on Saturday at Salford Royal Hospital. He now faces a long and uncertain road to recovery. “It’s been horrendous for all the family,” his dad said. “Matthew is in a serious condition and we are just taking it day by day. “He’s lost the use of his left arm and hand. He’s lost the feeling in the left side of his face. His speech is slurred. He’s having to drink through a straw. “We don’t know how long he’s going to be in hospital for or what the long-term is going to be like.” His mum added: “Matthew is the most caring and kind person you could ever want to meet. “He is such a lovely lad. He cannot understand why someone would do this to anyone. “I’m trying to stay positive because I cannot accept he’s not going to make a full recovery and Matthew has to believe the same.” His parents also pleaded for anyone with information about the attack to come forward.

Umar Malik lost 12 stone after becoming ashamed and upset with how he looked. He had always struggled with his weight but when he turned 18, he began guzzling 70 slices of toast and 56 eggs every week and within three years he had gained 10 stone. The 26-year-old became so big that after hitting 28st his scales could no longer measure his weight. Umar, who wore a size 6XL at his biggest, knew he needed to make a change in 2014, when his shower floor could no longer hold his weight and began leaking water into his kitchen.  However, he didn’t fully commit to losing weight until 2015 when he began attending a gym every day and started eating a strict diet of 3,000 calories a day. By November 2017, the personal trainer, who now helps others through their weight loss journey, had dropped down to 16st 2lbs and completed an unbelievable body transformation. Umar, from Ealing, in West London, said: “I remember standing in front of a mirror and feeling ashamed of how I looked. I knew I needed to make a change. “I had no body confidence. I was so big that the scales couldn’t measure me anymore. It was my lowest moment. It was just not healthy. “My family were really supportive but they didn’t really know what to do. I would love to go back and be there for myself because now I know what I needed. “Growing up in a typical Asian family, it was generally seen that if you ate a lot then you were the good kid and if you didn’t then there was something wrong with you. “I think that’s where it all started but I have always had a big appetite and enjoyed food. I was out of control but I didn’t want to commit to losing weight. “When I was growing up I couldn’t find clothes that would fit me and I had to wear my dad’s clothes. My weight would stop me from going out and socialising.”  Despite his size, from being a teenager, Umar visited a gym regularly for strength training but used it as a way to isolate himself and take out his frustrations. Umar said: “I went into my own shell and I was on my own a lot which was very unhealthy physically, mentally and emotionally. This didn’t change until I lost weight.” Umar’s ballooning waistline was caused by a huge daily intake of food but he now eats a calculated diet of six small meals a day and as well as strength training now also does cardio. Ultimate Performance, where Umar now works, has the world’s leading personal trainers and they have also worked with celebrities such as Gemma Atkinson, Scott Mills and Ryan Thomas. Umar said: “There was no way I wouldn’t see a result as long as I continued eating a strict diet and exercising regularly. It was always going to happen. I felt really good about it. “I wanted to be really strong and I achieved that goal. I now fuel my body so it is ready to work. I know what works for my body and what is best for me. “I am much more confident now and I love going out socialising and meeting new people.” BEFORE Breakfast – 10 pieces of toast, 8 eggs, chicken breast, beans, tomatoes and sweetcorn. Lunch - Post workout shake made of full-fat milk, oats, almonds and whey protein.  Dinner – Three servings of rice and chicken.  Drinks – Five pints of fizzy drinks.

Aimen Dean was a top spy for the UK intelligence agency during the war on terror. While undercover, he became one of Al Qaeda\u0027s most respected bomb-makers, swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden and rubbed shoulders with the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. He worked on the regime\u0027s chemical weapons programme and foiled attacks on civilians, saving countless lives while risking his own.  In an interview with Channel 4 News promoting his new memoir, Nine Lives: My time as MI6\u0027s top spy inside Al-Qaeda , Mr Dean said he was not worried about revenge attacks against him following the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in March.   The difference (between Skripal and I) is that he is pursued by one of the great powers of the world, and many of my former comrades are either dead or in prison. I take precautions. I’m not overly worried, but I take precautions to make sure that I don’t end up somewhere where there is a heavy concentration of my ex-associates. While working as a double-agent, Mr Dean said he reported back to the UK on locations of Al-Qaeda camps, the regime\u0027s new training methods and associates and its weapons of mass destruction program. Despite meeting one of the men who would go on to become one of the 9/11 hijackers, Mr Dean said the terrorist attack could not have been prevented with the intelligence MI6 had at the time. If you wanted to stop 9/11, you have to have at least 12 spies inside Al-Qaeda and each one inside one of the different departments. Only then you could have stopped it.  I don’t know (how many spies MI6 had) to be honest, but I will be surprised if there are more than two or three. Speaking of his coups during his work as a double agent, Mr Dean said he helped prevent a chemical attack on the New York Subway. There was a plot to attack the New York Subway with chemical weapons, a chemical device it was invented during my time actually, in that specialist lab in Afghanistan. And I was reporting on it regularly to the UK secret services. Although his work helped prevent some terrorist attacks, the former spy believed the war on terror would continue for years.

Researchers at Birmingham Aston University have developed a working desktop prototype of a machine which can take readings from blood and human tissue using laser beams. Developers say successful trials at the Ninewells Hospital in Dundee have concluded that the device allows a range of tests to be carried out quickly and painlessly. The innovation means the once fanciful idea of doctors using tricorders to effortlessly diagnose a variety of ailments may soon become reality.  Fans of the sci-fi series Star Trek will fondly remember Dr McCoy\u0027s tricorder - a handy multi-purpose device that checked fellow crew members from everything from broken bones to concussions. The machine uses three separate lasers to monitor how effectively blood is delivered to tissue, measure blood-oxygen levels and look at cell metabolism. It works by shining the laser beam on the patient\u0027s skin, while the patient feels nothing. That data is then instantly processed by a computer, and re-produced as a graph. The device has already had practical applications, being used in diagnostic procedures for strokes and skin cancers, and is non-invasive, as no needles are necessary.  It can constantly monitor blood delivery above the eyebrows, helping doctors mitigate the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension. In cancer patients, researchers have said it is a high-precision way of identifying the margins of head and neck skin cancers, which could help reduce the risk of tumours returning. A prototype wearable monitor has been developed that athletes can wear on their wrists. Much of the technology is ready to go into production, and the university recently launched Aston Medical Technology to commercialise inventions.

It’s the theatre of dreams for a lifelong Manchester United fan and Olly will be playing alongside legend Phil Neville in Robbie Williams’ England side while taking on Reds idols Eric Cantona and Jaap Stam in Usain Bolt’s World XI. But it’s two young soccer stars 7,000 miles away in Africa who will be giving Olly his pre-match goosebumps – teenagers Vincent and Veronica. The singer and TV presenter has just returned from an emotional and eye-opening trip to the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, where he learned how the game has transformed the lives of them and hundreds of others.  Olly, 34, went to see the Unicef-run Acakoro Football Academy, which helps desperately poor boys and girls aged seven to 18 with education, food and clothing, as well as soccer training. He heard how it saved Vincent, 13, and Veronica, 15, from a miserable, terrifying existence \u0026shyscavenging to survive on a rubbish tip. But he was unprepared for the horrific experience of returning with them to the dump that was their home for more than two years.  Olly explained: “It was awful – disgusting and truly shocking. The smell, the sight, the noise hits you first, like nothing you’ve ever experienced. “But then comes the \u0026shyrealisation that this is ‘home’ to thousands of vulnerable children. “What upset me more than anything was hearing that Vincent was just seven years old when he ran away from home to fend for himself at the dump. “He didn’t have a choice – his mum had other younger children and she couldn’t feed him. But he was seven – the same age as my nephew, Louie.  “That really hit home – imagining Louie out there all alone in that dreadful place.” Doting uncle Olly shook his head sadly as he looked at pictures of Vincent nervously showing him around the tip where he endured months of hell. He went on: “Vincent, bless him, was really worried and scared about going back to that place, but he wanted to help us, because Unicef helped him. “You can tell he has been deeply affected by the trauma he went through at such a young age. “Vincent explained how he’d rummage through the filthy litter for plastic, metal or anything he could sell for a few pennies. And he was eating bits of rotting food he found in the piles of waste – anything to survive.  “Vincent lived on that dump site for two years. He showed me how he used to burrow into the mounds of rubbish at night and put himself inside plastic bags to hide from all the gangs. He was so young, the older guys picked on him and forced him to do things. “They’d nick from him, they’d beat him up. He’s even got a mark on his face where they cut him. We also met Veronica, who was a bit older, but she lived there for two years as well. “She said she was one of the lucky ones as she had older friends who looked after her. But other young females would get abused, physically and sexually. “Just imagine it – the constant fear they must live with. Imagine seven-year-old kids sleeping in plastic bags on a dumping site at night. It’s just crazy.”  But Olly saw there is hope – thanks to projects like Acakoro, which was set up with some of the \u0026pound24million Soccer Aid has raised for Unicef in the past decade. He said: “It was amazing to see for myself what Soccer Aid and Unicef are doing for these kids. At Acakoro they get daily football coaching, but also a hot meal and a shower – a real luxury in the slums. They also get a football kit, other clothes, help with access to education and tuition for those struggling.  “School supplies, such as books and backpacks, are provided too. “It gives them somewhere to go, it keeps them off the streets away from gangs and thieving or getting themselves into trouble. The staff, the coaches, are incredible and really look after everyone. It’s amazing.” After visiting the rubbish dump with Vincent and Veronica, Olly enjoyed a game of soccer with them and other academy kids. And the X Factor winner, who co-owns and plays for Essex team \u0026shyCoggeshall Town FC, was impressed with their skills – especially Vincent’s.  Olly said: “It was difficult talking to Vincent at first, because he isn’t that chatty – he has gone through a lot of trauma. But he loves his football. He gets there early every day and he plays in goal now. “I said, ‘Right Vincent. Me and you in a penalty shoot out – we’ll do five, so how many are you going to save?’ “He smiled at me and said ‘all of them’. It was a lovely moment because it was the first time I’d seen him smile in two days there. He did save them all, too. It proved to me football truly does bring people together. And everyone can help Unicef open more places like Acakoro by donating to Soccer Aid on Sunday.

A proposal by the country’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has suggested a registration system be introduced to severely curtail access to pornography websites. Under this system, telecommunication companies would be forced to cut off access to x-rated sites unless customers choose to opt in. Politicians say access to porn is too easy and claimed that uncontrolled consumption is akin to taking drugs. Currently, over 50 percent of Polish internet users access free porn at home and while at work.  Piotr Uscinski, an MP for the country’s ruling party, said that pornography “works on the brains of its consumers and leads to drastic “personality changes”. He said: Pornography is a threat to public health because it leads to a pandemic of porn addiction. The government also argues that adult content is too easy for young people to watch.  Research from the Integrated Prevention Institute shows that in Poland, 60 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls are first exposed to porn at the age of 11. PiS MP Arkadiusz Mularczyk said: We should civilise and limit this sphere of life because we can not allow demoralisation. Today, the law is too liberal in this respect. Poland\u0027s Law and Justice party has faced repeated criticism over its ultra-conservative approach to many social issues.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the

cars and motorbikes but didn\u0026#8217t buy his first classic car until 1981 when his and his wife Maureen\u0026#8217s children were older.\u0026#8220When you were younger and first married you couldn\u0026#8217t afford to buy a second car, a classic car,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220As the family grow you then find you find you have a little more finances to indulge,\u0026#8221 Maureen added.He first bought the Mini Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 on July 20, 1984 before selling it to a man in Meigle on October 9, 1985, but it was left in a state of disrepair and David said the last time he saw it was \u0026#8220sitting forlornly in a garden in Meigle\u0026#8221.David joined the Tayside Classic Car Club in 2001, when a work colleague suggested he come along to a meeting.\u0026#8220It started from there and then I started attending show with the club and I\u0026#8217ve been with them ever since, 17 years,\u0026#8221 he said.He didn\u0026#8217t hear anything of the Mini until Maurice Cruickshank from Arbroath joined the club and said he had a Cooper \u0026#8216S\u0026#8217 with the same registration as the one David used to own, which he had bought and extensively restored.So when Maurice said he was looking to sell it, David decided it was time to bring it back home again and he bought it October 7, 2011.The Kingsmuir couple now take it along to different shows with the club, of which David is now on the committee of while the couple share the duty of newsletter editor.The club was great as it accepted all different types of classic cars which suits the couple, who also have a 2001 Jaguar XJ8 Executive and a 1961 Hillman Minx 1500cc among their collection.\u0026#8220What you\u0026#8217ve said you like about it is there\u0026#8217s a

interesting than a one make club.\u0026#8220You usually find someone who\u0026#8217s had that problem or knows someone so if you\u0026#8217re stuck for hint you can find someone.\u0026#8221David grew

lived in Scotland.\u0026#8221Maureen said they were quite well placed as they could visit the classic car shows both north and south of them.\u0026#8220Because people don\u0026#8217t tend to to travel long distance, when you go up Fraserburgh you tend to see a lot different vehicles up there than what you do here and the same when you go down south, you\u0026#8217ll see something

could turn to Aberdeen goalkeeper Danny Rogers to help fill the gaps in their last line of defence.With Deniz Mehmet out long term and Harry Lewis back at Southampton, the Tangerines are on the hunt for two first-team goalies.And 24-year-old Rogers is one name on their list of possible additions.New York born and an American citizen, Rogers was capped nine times at U/21 level for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his Irish mother.He’s only played a handful of games for the Dons in six years at Pittodrie, but has over 100 top-team appearances under his belt during loan spells at Airdrie, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Most of those games came during a two-year spell with Falkirk between 2015 and 2017.He recently signed a two-year contract extension but could be available on loan again.Deniz, meanwhile, is now likely to have the operation to repair knee ligament damage next week.It was scheduled for early last week but the surgeon in England decided to delay it because the joint he damaged against Dunfermline in the play-offs last month remained swollen.He’s likely to be out until around the turn of the year.The Tangerines, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of young Celtic defender Sam Wardrop and it’s understood Dunfermline’s Fraser Aird will be revealed as another member of the squad over the next few days.A deal for Wardrop was agreed with the Hoops last week and the 20-year-old joins on a two-year contract.The right-back has represented Scotland at U/15, U/16, U/17 and U/19 levels and captained Celtic’s Youth team to Scottish Cup victory in 2016.“Sam is an athletic and energetic defender who likes to get forward and attack the opposition. I am pleased that we have secured his signing,” said boss Csaba Laszlo.“We must build a squad capable of winning the Championship, and he will be an important part of the squad next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b17b672067ab.jpg ","title":"sams new community foodbank in dundee staves off hunger for 160 folk in two months","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new community foodbank has helped prevent 160 local people going hungry in just two months.Food for Thought – a food and clothing bank – launched at the end of April at its base in Charleston Library.The scheme, which is headed by Sam Bruce, was set up in a bid to tackle food poverty among those who do not qualify for referral to services in the city such as traditional foodbanks.People who have come through the organisation’s doors include single parents, unemployed people whose partners work or those who have fallen on hard times.Sam said she was inspired to start up the food and clothing bank by similar schemes around the country.She said: “I was part of a money saving group and I saw that places in England and in Edinburgh were doing something similar.“I run a playgroup and there were people telling me they knew of others who were really struggling.“I was listening to folk who were saying they didn’t qualify for any support from foodbanks – maybe because their husband works or because they have a part-time job – and I thought the idea would definitely benefit people in that position.”The way the organisation works is by offering weekly memberships instead of charging for the produce – with people becoming a member for £1.50 and taking home a bag of essentials for that week.Sam said the group has helped 160 people since it started.There are a number of foodbanks operating in Dundee – however, many of them operate on a referral basis, meaning professionals like GPs or social workers can send people to receive a food parcel.Sam said she wanted Food for Thought to help people who “fell between the lines” and didn’t meet the criteria to be referred by outside agencies.She added: “It is a huge help for some people who might be struggling. It means that people have the basics sorted out and then they can maybe use the little money they have on something else they need.“It can mean that people don’t have to go without certain things or make the really hard decisions.”Food for Thought gets its produce from donations and also FairShare – a scheme which aims to cut down on waste and poverty by distributing items close to their sell-by date around community organisations.One of the patrons, Lynne Anderson, 40, from Dryburgh, hailed the project and the organisers behind it as “amazing”. She said: “It is a brilliant thing. I heard about it through the playgroup and popped in to see what was going on.“It is just a brilliant thing that Sam is doing.”Not only does the scheme mean that people who might go hungry have an option to turn to, Sam said it has also doubled up as a social group – with people turning out to enjoy each other’s company.She added she would back similar projects right around the city – but is unable to branch out owing to childcare commitments.However she said her long-term plans are to open a larger shop with the same ethos as the foodbank.She also praised the community support for the project – including local charity Yusuf Youth Initiative – which she said had promoted it.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/Vet-stock.jpg ","title":"teacher unveils plan for first cat cafe in local area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDiners could soon be feline fine at Fife’s first cat cafe.Cat lover Joanne Jarvie has unveiled plans which would see her furry friends cuddle up to customers in St Andrews.Teacher Joanne, of Kirkcaldy, has applied for planning permission to change the use of a building at 78 South Street from retail and office space to a cat cafe.The cats, which are Joanne’s pets, would mingle with customers at the venue, which would also host arts, crafts and relaxation sessions.Joanne said the physiological and psychological benefits of human and animal bonding had long been recognised.If given the go-ahead, no food would be prepared on the premises, with only cakes and cold packaged snacks sold.The cats would be transported to and from Joanne’s home each day, with a period of acclimatisation to the premises before opening.An area would also be provided to allow the cats to retreat from the public.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1daf5c232.jpg ","title":"va jobs nearly 500 apply for visitor assistant roles","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNearly 500 applications have been submitted for visitor assistant roles at the V\u0026ampA Dundee.The museum announced last month that it would be recruiting approximately 32 new members of staff to join the visitor assistant team ahead of the official opening on Saturday September 15.Owing to the volume of applications, a deadline has been set for 5pm today.A spokeswoman for the museum said: “Visitor assistants will play vital roles within the museum, so we are delighted with the level of interest there has been and would like to thank everyone who has applied so far.“We encourage everyone who wants to be part of the team to look at the recruitment page of our website for more information about the visitor assistant roles.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Super-gonorrhoea bug could spread across UK","story":"                          EXPERTS fear drug-resistant super-gonorrhoea could spread across the UK after a 22% hike in the STI -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget.

signing Chris Forrester today vowed to be an influential goal-scoring playmaker – starting in Europe.The midfielder became Dons boss Derek McInnes’ first major signing of the summer when signing a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Rated as a multi-million star by Peterborough only 18 months ago, the Dons secured the 25-year-old for a fee understood to be £200,0000.Former Posh captain Forrester had a year left on his contract at Peterborough but was slapped on the transfer list at the end of the season by Steve Evans.The midfielder is a former Republic of Ireland U21 cap and broke into the senior squad in 2016 but has still to be capped.Dons boss Derek McInnes’ main priority in the transfer window was to replace the void left by the exit of Kenny McLean.Scotland cap McLean was the Reds’ main midfield playmaker but has left Pittodrie for Championship side Norwich City.Forrester insists he can bring that creative spark McInnes is searching for and aims to hit the ground running in the Europa League.He said: “I am not afraid to get on the ball as that is what I love to do.“I love to get the game going and passing to the lads that can maybe score the goals.“This season I want to be the one receiving the ball, doing something with it and also scoring a few goals.“In the last two seasons at Peterborough I forgot how to find the goal.“Coming up here one of my main aims is to get back in amongst the goals.“I aim to be a goal scoring midfielder as opposed to someone just sitting in the middle and passing the ball.“I want to see myself up there pressing the ball and creating the assists or creating the goal that wins the game.”Aberdeen had also made an enquiry about Forrester’s Peterborough team-mate Jack Baldwin.However, the Reds cooled their interest in the defender.Forrester revealed boss McInnes was pivotal in persuading him to move to Pittodrie.He said: “He (McInnes) said he sees me as an important player for the team which is music to my ears.“He said he sees me coming into the team and being the main passer which is what I liked to hear.“That helped to bring me here.”Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round stage on July 26.Despite playing in England’s third tier, Forrester has no concerns about making his Dons debut on the continental stage.He played in Europe for both Bohemians and St Patrick’s Athletic from the League of Ireland.He said: “My first European trip was with Bohemians when I was 18 and we went to Slovenia to play Ljubljana (Olimpija).“That was a massive experience for me and I did that every year I was in the League of Ireland.“For about five years I went on European trips and had some great results.“We (St Patrick’s Athletic) knocked out Siroki Brijeg (of Bosnia, 3-2 aggregate in 2012).“We also played Legia Warsaw which was a massive game in front of a massive crowd.“We were 1-0 up until the scored an equalizer in the 89th minute (1-1 first leg, 5-0 second for 6-1 aggregate loss).“I have plenty of experience in Europe and hopefully can bring that to the team this season.”Forrester was so highly rated Peterborough club chairman valued him as a multi-million pound player in January 2016.However, after a frustrating season he was transfer listed this summer with a year left on his Posh deal.Forrester said: “As soon as my agent told me about the interest from Aberdeen I knew that I needed a fresh start from Peterborough.“Things didn’t go so well last season.“I could see Aberdeen get over 15,000 at games most weeks and it is a club with stature.“I am looking forward

plastic bottles, paper and fuel.Fish are not caught because they do not get close enough to the surface to be pulled in.Clean water is then pumped back into the sea, helping to keep pollution levels

reputation","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe boss of the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has said that he believes the development could “change the history” of the city.Speaking during a boat visit to the new wind farm, also known as the European Offshore Wind Development Centre (EOWDC), Vattenfall project director Adam Ezzamel said that he wants the project to change Aberdeen from a traditional “oil and gas hub” to a city known for renewable energy.Once hooked up to the grid, the new wind farm will supply enough electricity to power 80,000 homes, with one turn of a turbine powerful enough to supply an average house with enough electricity for an entire day.Mr Ezzamel said: “This project is all about transferring Aberdeen from an oil hub to a global energy hub with Scotland’s largest test and demonstration centre.\u0026#8220It’s a power station in its own right that will be powering more than 70% of Aberdeen’s domestic electricity demand on an annual basis.”“We have borrowed technology from the oil and gas industry and put it into the renewables industry.\u0026#8220This development can really change the way people think about Aberdeen.”Mr Ezzamel also said yesterday that he believes the Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm to be the fastest built offshore wind development in Scotland’s history.The wind farm boasts some of the most powerful turbines in the world thanks to an innovative suction bucket foundation which has been sunk into the sands off Aberdeen Bay.With the project taking just nine weeks from first foundation to final turbine, Mr Ezzamel believes it is “surely” the fastest build of a wind farm off Scotland’s shores.He said: “I’ve looked hard for counter examples, but none are forthcoming. It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans to open new brewdog coffee shop in north east town deferred","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncillors have deferred plans to open a new coffee shop in a north-east town.Brewdog submitted the plans to Aberdeenshire Council to open a branch of the Coffee Apothecary at The Square in Ellon.The plans have been lodged for the former Helping Hands store in the town.The Coffee Apothecary, which has a branch in Udny, would move into the site after agreeing a deal with the beer giants.Officials at Aberdeenshire Council had recommended the proposals for approval but councillors have deferred the application until a site visit is carried out.Ward councillor Richard Thomson said: “There was a number of concerns about the waste disposal arrangements so we have deferred for a site visit just to look at that.”A date for the site visit is yet to be arranged but is expected to take place within three weeks.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25.

Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

But we have celebrated now and it\u0027s time to move forward and look ahead to next season. Shankland said: It has been a great season, and to get the recognition is obviously good.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drive through coffee shop petrol","story":"NewsDrive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps could be built on busy main roadThe ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:45, 6 JUN 2018NewsA77 near Dutch House Roundabout (Image: Alister Firth/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA drive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps are to be built on the A77 if plans get the green light. The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The couple now live in Kilmarnock. “We actually met about 15 years ago when both of us used to go ice skating at the Magnum on a Friday night,” said Kim. The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on. Claire’s Crystal Brides arranged the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo and Jett Patterson of Allure Hair \u0026amp Beauty, Kilmarnock created the hair and beauty looks for the day.

But the iconic pile will remain under Malaysian control, after a deal was struck to keep it in South East Asian hands. It follows a purchase of the building by “experienced hoteliers” for an undisclosed fee from countryman, Eng Huat Ung. Student flats and offices are among development plans in the pipeline, the Post has learned. Now bosses are seeking talks with South Ayrshire Council, who in March slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the site.  Structural engineers are being lined up to tackle the hotel, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. A source close to the deal said: “You can be rest assured that the new owners are keen to redevelop this building and put it to good use as soon as possible.” Mr Ung snapped up the property in a \u0026pound750,000 deal back in 2010. But attempts to keep it afloat as a hotel quickly failed and two Dangerous Building notices have followed. Bosses at Network Rail, who run the town’s train station underneath, have also grown increasingly concerned for the impact on their platforms. We revealed how a rat infestation was among the ongoing problems uncovered.  And council chiefs warned that a “wake-up call” was needed after issuing their March order on the building. Another source linked to the buy-out added: “The hotel has been in desperate need of a new direction for many years now. “This new investment should be welcomed by all in the town of Ayr and hopefully it signals the start of a much brighter future for a grand building.” A council spokesman said: “We understand the building has been bought but at this stage we have had no official confirmation. “We’ll continue to talk to the owners to ensure the building is kept in a good state of general repair.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Foul-mouthed supermarket worker ordered to pay compensation to colleagues","story":"A FOUL-mouthed supermarket worker has been ordered to pay compensation to four colleagues at a local store after subjecting them to abusive and offensive remarks.\nTwenty seven year old Toyah Chetwynd also made abusive comments about them on social media.\nShe pleaded guilty to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at Sainsbury\u0027s in Hawick on February 6.\nProcurator fiscal Graham Fraser said that Chetwynd was on long-term sick from the store and had been having a \"difficult relationship\" with management and colleagues.\nOn the day of the offence she turned up at Sainsburys at 5.30pm saying she wanted a meeting with management.\nMr Fraser said two supervisors took her to the training room where she called one a \"fat bitch\" and the other a \"dirty little slut\" before calming down and leaving the store.\nBut he explained that at five to nine in the evening it was noticed she was outside the store with her partner and was again being abusive towards staff .\nMr Fraser said: \"She was asked what she was doing there.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

child\u0027s life by skiving a lecture.\nAnthony Lenton and his classmates avoided an afternoon tutorial at Borders College to register with the Anthony Nolan Trust.\nAnd within a few months his genetic profile proved to be an identical match for a gravelly-ill toddler 150 miles away in Aberdeenshire.\nAnthony, who is now the co-manager of William Hill bookmaker\u0027s in Galashiels, told us: \"We all had a dull lecture to look forward to after lunch at the College when we saw a girl from the Anthony Nolan Trust looking for people to register.\n\"I had no knowledge of what the Anthony Noland Trust did but we decided to take our time filling in the forms so we didn\u0027t have to go to the lecture.\n\"Basically, sciving a lecture was the best decision I ever made.\"\nAt just 11 months old, Finn Mackin was diagnosed with a rare and dangerous form of leukaemia after a suspicious lump was found on one of his eyes.\nTumours developed and it was considered that chemotherapy was the Stonehaven toddler\u0027s only hope.\nBut several unsuccessful doses of treatment failed to cure him from cancer during a four-month stay at the Royal Aberdeen Children\u0026rsquos Hospital.\nAnd consultants decided the only remaining option of saving Finn\u0027s life was a high-risk stem cell transplant.\nDuring countrywide searches for donors, it was found that Anthony in Galashiels was the perfect match.\nThe youngster underwent a successful transplant at the end of 2015, followed by more than 50 blood transfusions, before eventually being declared cancer-free.\nFinn remains cancer-free and last week he was introduced to the skiving student who saved his life.\nAnthony added: \"It was really emotional meeting Finn.\n\"There is not allowed to be any contact for two years but then Anthony Nolan\u0026nbsppassed on my number and Finn\u0027s mum made contact.\n\"It turned out I was a perfect match for Finn - a 12 out of 12, which could only be bettered if he had a twin.\n\"I have no idea how we are so genetically matched as I\u0027m originally from Cambridgeshire and Finn\u0027s family are all from around Aberdeen.\"\nStephen has now been invited to Finn\u0027s parents wedding next year.\nFinn\u0027s mum Siobhan said: \"Without Anthony, Finn wouldn\u0027t be here - as simple as that.\n\"We\u0026rsquoll be forever thankful.\"\nThe Anthony Nolan\u0026nbspTrust manages and recruits donors to a nationwide register to help match donors with cancer sufferers.\nThe charity also carries out research to help make bone marrow transplants more effective.\nAmy Bartlett from Anthony Nolan said: \"You could literally save somebody\u0027s life, as we\u0027ve seen happen with young Finn.\n\"I mean this story could have been so different, but for the generosity of a complete stranger.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Bolton man accused of peeping Tom offence at caravan park showers","story":"A 44-year-old man has been charged under the Sexual Offences Act accused of watching a

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.  Sarah Montgomery said: \u0026ldquoIn past years we have been very active in supporting Business in the Community\u0026rsquos Give and Gain days but this year we opted to strengthen the relationship we have been building with Musselburgh Grammar School.  \u0026ldquoWith excellent support from Heritage Portfolio, we were able to put on a diverse programme which gave real-life experience to 20 students who have expressed an interest in hospitality and tourism careers, and this will contribute to their employability pathways initiative.  \u0026ldquoThree of those students returned to the racecourse to support us in hosting a British Horseracing Authority roadshow which provided a valuable opportunity for the pupils to put their training into practice and which will be a useful addition to their CVs.

The Hawaiian capital\u0026rsquos city council passed the motion \u0026ndash the first of its kind in the United States \u0026ndash by six votes to three on Wednesday.  The measure prevents \u0026ldquosurge pricing if increased rates are higher than the maximum fare set by the city.  Uber sent emails to customers across the island of Oahu, which is where the rule would apply, urging them to oppose the motion that would impose \u0026ldquooutdated taxi-style requirements on rideshare.  Oahu taxi drivers have been at odds with those who drive for mobile apps that connect riders with nearby drivers.  Taxi companies complain that companies such as Uber and Lyft create an unfair playing field because they face fewer restrictions.  Uber has been told the city has not received any consumer complaints about surge pricing, said Tabatha Chow, the company\u0026rsquos senior operations manager for Hawaii.  Honolulu has the highest taxi prices in the nation and Uber is 40% cheaper, she told council members on Wednesday.  Surge pricing only happens during peak times such as rush hour, weekend nights and big events, she said, adding that fares go back down when more drivers are on the road.  Robert Deluze, owner of Robert\u0026rsquos Taxis, said ride-hailing companies have hurt the taxi business and questioned why Uber and Lyft need to use surge pricing if their fares are cheaper.  Councilwoman Kymberly Marcos Pine, who voted for the limits, said she was concerned to hear that US Navy sailors getting off ships in Pearl Harbor recently were charged as much as 221 dollars (\u0026pound165) to get to Waikiki when a cab ride was 44 dollars (\u0026pound33).  As the wife of a sailor, she said she wants to protect service members from being \u0026ldquoprice gouged.  Uber said surge pricing gives drivers the incentive to work in busier areas, which lowers wait times for riders and ensures reliability.  Riders and drivers who submitted testimony opposing the measure said taxis are not as reliable or affordable as ride-hailing companies.  Uber driver Lisa Gonzales wrote that she drives to help support her family of six.  During surge pricing, passengers have the option to accept or reject costs, she said, and that it is based on supply and demand.  Uber and Lyft officials testified in City Council committees last month that the cap on surge pricing would be the first such restriction on the companies in the country, the Honolulu newspaper reported.  Council Chairman Ernie Martin said he wrote the measure to ensure consumers won\u0026rsquot pay an \u0026ldquounreasonable price. He said companies will still be able to employ surge pricing \u0026mdash or as he prefers to call it, \u0026ldquopredatory pricing \u0026mdash within limits.  The measure would set precedence nationwide he said, adding: \u0026ldquoOther cities are struggling with this as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7526951.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.  Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!

The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Eid al-Fitr, as it is more formally known, is the day-long celebration marking the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting.  For Muslims, this is one of the most significant dates on the calendar, and is marked by performing a special Eid prayer, exchanging gifts, and - more importantly - gathering with friends and loved ones to share a feast.  Much like Easter Sunday in the Christian calendar, Eid does not fall on the same day every year.  Instead, Eid and the period of Ramadan are both dictated by a new moon, as Islam follows the lunar calendar.  Restaurants across Glasgow will be offering deals to angry customers - regardless of background - and other events will be taking place in the lead up to the big day.  One of the city\u0026rsquos Indian street food specialists, Tuk Tuk, is hosting Glasgow\u0026rsquos only potluck celebration of Eid with a specially created menu and Bollywood dance classes.

The Bollywood dance workshops are run by Nak-Shatra Dance and Events and will take place from 5pm to 7pm and should be booked in advance.  All ticket holders will receive a choice of meat or vegetarian set menus, with vegan alternatives available on request, and plenty of lamb, chicken, biryani and tantalising sides will be flying out of the kitchen.  Guests are also allowed to bring their own drinks with them, free of charge.  Owner Rizvi Khaleque spoke of his excitement ahead of the big day, and said: \u0026ldquoI love Eid and I\u0026rsquom excited to be able to share our potluck meal with the people of Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoWe would love people to experience some Eid-inspired dishes, Tuk Tuk style.  \u0026ldquoSince opening in Glasgow, we\u0026rsquove been delighted by the welcome we\u0026rsquove received and are confident the city is well placed to celebrate Eid in this way.  Tickets for both the dinner and dance classes are now on sale via eventbrite.  The day will include a wide range of activities, including a funfair with plenty of thrilling rides, a souk zone from where you can pick up gifts, a foods-from-around-the-world area, children\u0026rsquos zone with sports, crafts, entertainment, games and face painting as well as plenty of ice-cream which will be a relief if the weather turns warm.

The Hidden Gardens, behind the Tramway in Glasgow\u0027s south side, still stands.  And in the last ten years the small arts charity, led by Angus Farquhar - who previously had been in the industrial music group Test Department - also wrought significant change at St Peter\u0027s Seminary. For NVA to take on, and try to transform, the modern ruin, did always seem like an ambitious, perhaps extraordinary, task.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish arts firm to close this year and abandons plans to restore St Peters  The company did begin work on its project to breathe new life into the ruin: deadly asbestos was cleared, the vaults were stabilised, and thousands of invasive rhododendron bushes have been removed. But ultimately, without a major national institution to step in (which, at some point, perhaps NVA was half expecting to happen) and provide funding, scale and stability, the project proved too much. The public money that was raised for the project and not used was paid back last year. The company will close without lurching into bankruptcy, I am told. But NVA is over, and who knows if art work like Speed of Light or The Path in Glen Lyon will be attempted again.  What cannot be lost in the closure of NVA is the role of Creative Scotland, the nation\u0027s arts funder. In January, in the Regular Funding round which has been the cause of much controversy and debate, NVA were not granted regular funding. It had been funded before. At the time it seemed a surprising decision, but was somewhat lost in the tumult surrounding similar decisions in theatre and music. Mr Farquhar, too, did not - at least in public - kick up much of a fuss. Perhaps he was politic to do so. However, when Creative Scotland made a series of U-turns on its cuts, NVA was not among the reprieved.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish arts firm to close this year and abandons plans to restore St Peters  Mr Farquhar will, one suspects, find a new outlet for his creativity, and one hopes his team can find new jobs, too. And as for St Peter\u0027s? Completed and consecrated in 1966, it was only used for its planned purpose for 13 years. It has been longer a ruin. Perhaps NVA has saved it from perdition entirely, but now it has been cast back into limbo."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7585596.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Fruit farms face chronic shortage of foreign labour","story":"              FRUIT farmers are demanding a shake-up in attitudes to agriculture as the \u0026pound100-million-a-year industry faces a chronic shortage of workers.  Latest figures show that just one in ever 400 seasonal workers in the Scottish industry is British, forcing growers to fly as far as Moldova to try and recruit staff by offering free flights.  As the picking season starts, Scottish farmers are still facing a huge shortfall leaving the prospect of crops left rotting in fields and price rises in the shops.  Farmers in Angus, Perthshire and Fife that is the home of Scotland\u0027s fruit-picking industry believe that perceived difficulties with the British benefits system and job centres making the prospect of seasonal work less appealing.    This is combined with a public belief that fruit picking is too demeaning or too hard, forcing growers to set up recruitment missions in Eastern Europe.  Fruit and vegetables left to rot in fields after fall in farm workers from the EU after Brexit vote  Angus Growers. a group of 18 producers, say that without any interest from British workers, farms now need to recruit from outside the EU to cope but cannot unless the UK Government revive the seasonal agricultural workers\u0026rsquo scheme (SAWS), which was scrapped in 2013 by then Home Secretary Theresa May.  Tim Stockwell, of Barnsmuir Farm near Crail in North East Fife, who admits offering free flights in some cases, which can cost up to \u0026pound250, to encourage staff from Bulgaria to Scotland and has organised a mission to the country to recruit. But they are still about 50 short of the 350 needed for picking strawberries and raspberries this summer.  He believes the benefits system makes potential British workers who are unemployed feel \"it\u0027s better off to stay at home\".    \"There is not enough people in Britain looking for these jobs,\" he said. \"We have moved on a generation from the time on farms when people were doing a lot of physical hard work. Those people are not around anymore.  \"Also, they don\u0027t want short-term work. We had a scheme for school-leavers through job centres once and we had about ten or 12 people. They just don\u0027t stick it. They prefer not to do that type of work.  \"Twenty years ago we had local people and they would be from the mining towns along the Fife coast, they were hard workers. But then as it has moved on the next generation doesn\u0027t want to do that sort of thing.\"  The last Angus Growers study of seasonal workers found that from a 4112 pickers workforce just 11 were British nationals.    Farmers believe the pay is attractive, with workers typically given the living wage of \u0026pound7.83 an hour, which rises to over \u0026pound11 an hour for overtime during a season that can last between ten and 16 weeks.  Shortage of seasonal migrant workers revealed  William Houston, general manager of Angus Growers, said: \"We need 4000 people in Angus and there are 1400 employable unemployed people in the area alone the last time we looked. Some of those unemployed people, no doubt could do those jobs.\"  He says attempts have been made to use job centres but he said: \"They don\u0027t encourage us to come in, or for people to come and work on the farms.  \"You get the feeling that they don\u0027t consider it a proper job. \"I don\u0027t understand why it\u0027s not an attractive proposition. Things need to change.\"  He indicated that the benefits system may also not be encouraging unemployed people to take on seasonal work.  \"This is bigger than just picking. I think society has lost touch with food, and lost touch with life and what life\u0027s all about and that we need to grow really good food to be healthy,\" he said.  \"It\u0027s about our whole relationship we have got with food, fresh food and local food which has to change. It is about bringing food back to the centre of our culture and celebrating how good Scottish food is.  \"When you get a connection with food and life you then start being more prepared to work for it.    \"How many schools, careers teachers encourage youngsters to go into farming? There is a national shortage of agronomists, and schools are not pushing it as a career. Everyone is being pushed into university rather than starting at the bottom and working your way up with practical skills.\"  Farmers call for action to secure migrant seasonal workforce  He said he thinks people perceive fruit picking to be demeaning. \"It is also hard work. You are standing up for eight hours a day in a poly tunnel which is at the moment over 30 degrees. \"When it is like this, we are inclined to start at four or five in the morning to get the majority of the work done before it gets too hot. That means it suits the system for people to live in caravans on the farm. Which is another reason not to do it for a lot of UK people.  Recruitment agencies have warned that they cannot secure the number of workers needed by British farmers to pick their fruit and vegetables this year.  Over half of recruitment companies could not find the labour even in the \"quiet\" first months of this year, the Association of Labour Providers (ALP) says And the National Farmers Union reports that last year there was a 17 per cent drop in seasonal workers coming to the UK. This led to some valuable produce being left to rot in the fields.    Staff at a fruit farm in St Andrews have\u0026nbspvisited\u0026nbspMoldova and Romania to recruit workers  Two-thirds of the Eastern European seasonal worker on British farms come from Romania and Bulgaria.  British farmers warned last year of the difficulties they were facing with recruitment, and according to the ALP report, three-quarters of agriculture and horticulture businesses anticipate shortages in low and unskilled roles in 2018.  Warnings over fruit-picking post Brexit  Mr Stockwell said they went to recruit in Bulgaria to \"show that there\u0027s a real job on a real farm\" because they were aware of cases where bogus farm businesses had been set up that could discourage the potential workforce.  \"I am not sure how you encourage someone from, say Glasgow, to come,\" he said. \"They should want to but I am not sure they do want to.  \"I am not sure why they wouldn\u0027t want to do this sort of work, because people come from abroad, they commit themselves and when they get here are more committed to sticking it out.\"    A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoBrexit continues to be the biggest threat to our rural economy and retaining access to potential workers via single market membership is essential to meeting the needs of rural businesses.  \u0026ldquoThe evidence is clear that the UK Government\u0026rsquos position on migration does not work for Scotland\u0027s needs, and that is why the Scottish Parliament has recently joined the Scottish Government in calling for new powers to enable a Scotland-specific policy.

Economics expert David Skilling estimated that Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP per capita to be $39,337 (\u0026pound29,282) in 2017 \u0026ndash slightly lower than that of the UK and below that in 13 other comparator countries.  The slowdown in the oil and gas sector has hit GDP growth in Scotland, the report said, while adding that being in the UK \u0026ndash which has \u0026ldquounder-  performed the rest of Europe by a significant margin over the past few years \u0026ndash had also acted as a \u0026ldquodrag on performance.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScotland\u0027s economy continues to lag behind the rest of the UK, as critics take aim at SNP  The economic adviser looked at the performance of countries including Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Hong Kong and Switzerland, where GDP per capita was measured at $80,591 (\u0026pound60,000), more than double the Scottish figure.  In a new report for the think-tank Reform Scotland, published with the Scottish Policy Foundation, Dr Skilling said:  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic performance has lagged that of other small advanced economies.He added: \u0026ldquoThere is scope to strengthen Scotland\u0026rsquos competitive position using its set of devolved powers through deliberate policy action.  Looking at successful small economies, the report concluded there was \u0026ldquono single specific policy model followed by all.  However, it stressed the importance of having a \u0026ldquodisciplined approach to fiscal policy, along with an \u0026ldquoefficient, competitive business environment that allows for firms to expand.  GDP growth in Scotland has averaged 1.4% since 2000, the report said, putting the country \u0026ldquonear the bottom of the small advanced economies group.  It stated: \u0026ldquoThere has been a consistent gap between Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP growth rates and that of other small advanced economies.  \u0026ldquoThis has led to a steady divergence in Scotland\u0026rsquos per capita income from that of other small advanced economies.  Analysis: Scale of disappointment over UK economy writ large in sterling falls  The report went on: \u0026ldquoPart of Scotland\u0026rsquos recent GDP growth weakness is due to the slowdown in the oil and gas sector (Norway has also suffered).  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos relatively deep exposure to the rest of the UK, which has under-performed the rest of Europe by a significant margin over the past few years, is also a drag on performance.  Dr Skilling also argued tax rates must remain in line with other small advanced economies - pointing out that in the comparator countries the top rate for personal tax has been reduced from 47% to 44% since 2000.  In Scotland, the top rate of income tax - paid by those earning \u0026pound150,000 a year or more - was increased in the 2018-19 budget, making it higher than in the rest of the UK at 46p.  While spending on research and development can help improve competitiveness, the report said Scotland was \u0026ldquoin the bottom third of the advanced economies group in terms of total R\u0026ampD spending, at 1.5% of GDP in 2016.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRural businesses could add billions to economy, says report  Reform Scotland director Chris Deerin said: \u0026ldquoThe report is not about nationalism or unionism - it is about how we in Scotland can create the conditions for greater economic growth in order to raise our standard of living and better fund our public services.  \u0026ldquoThe lessons from the paper are clear. To achieve economic success, we must ensure our tax rates are competitive, that we have a high-quality business environment and invest in human capital and innovation.  Dr Skilling looked at largely the same small economies studied in the SNP-commissioned Sustainable Growth Commission report, which examined the economic prospects for an independent Scotland.  Former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, who chaired the commission, said when the report was published recently that it showed \u0026ldquohow Scotland can emulate the best-performing economies and societies in the world.

The UK Government is expected this morning to publish details of its \u0026ldquoIrish back-stop proposal, which would only ever happen if a deal on a post-Brexit customs plan with Brussels was not agreed.

Downing Street insisted it was confident the contingency plan would never be needed yet UK ministers are still divided over choosing their preferred post-Brexit customs plan the new customs partnership or maximum facilitation.  Mr Davis is also said to have clashed with the Prime Minister over publication of the Government\u0026rsquos eagerly-awaited Brexit White Paper, setting out its withdrawal strategy. She has thwarted his intention to publish it before the EU Council at the end of this month.  Mrs May will now chair a \u0026ldquoclear-the-air meeting of her so-called Brexit War Cabinet before she travels to Canada for the G7 summit.  Mr Davis said he \"expected\" there would be a time limit in the signed-off version of the back-stop plan but did not appear totally sure.  After giving a speech on Brexit and security, the Secretary of State said the details had yet to be approved but believed today\u0026rsquos meeting of the Cabinet\u0027s Brexit sub-committee would be \"decisive\".

Earlier at a rowdy Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Jeremy Corbyn mocked Mrs May over the delay in publishing the White Paper and deciding on a customs option, saying, to Labour laughter, she had delivered \"more delays and cancellations\" than the troubled Northern Rail service.  The PM hit back, repeating her pledge to avoid a hard Irish border and accusing Labour of seeking to \"frustrate\" the Brexit process at every stage.  Ian Blackford for the SNP referred to reports that civil servants had drawn up scenarios for a \"Doomsday Brexit,\" that would leave the country short of medicine, fuel and food.  \"And now the Dutch are telling Dutch businesses not to risk buying UK products, said the Highland MP. \u0026ldquoDoes the Prime Minister understand the catastrophic negotiating position she has cornered herself into?\" he asked.

What I saw there shocked me. Witnessing the colossal and devastating impact of bombs, shells and rockets is nothing new to me as a reporter, but Raqqa was something else.  During my time in the city, I recall one afternoon standing on the bullet-pocked balcony of a flat belonging to a local man called Khalil al-Khalil.  \u0026ldquoLook around you, he insisted with a sweep of his arm, as we gazed out across the surrounding streets.  Everywhere, crumbling shell smashed tower blocks stretched as far as we could see and the charred burnt out carapaces of cars lay in the streets.  \u0026ldquoSo far we have received no help and the outside world seems to have forgotten us, but the people of Raqqa are rich in their character and we will rebuild the city that is our home, of that I\u0026rsquom certain, Mr Khalil told me, his voice exuding the sort of determination that will be needed to undertake the daunting task he suggests.  Today Raqqa is all but unrecognisable even to its citizens, some of whom like Mr al-Khalil have returned from across Syria and beyond to try resurrecting their lives and businesses.  Many cities of course have been destroyed in the wars in Iraq and Syria since 2011, but the destruction is worse in Raqqa than anywhere else. An estimated 11,000 buildings are destroyed or severely damaged, and the remains of countless bodies still lie under its canyons of ruins their stench drifting on the breeze.  While recently accompanying the Civil Defence Unit volunteers tasked with recovering these remains, the team members told me that currently they still had 6,000 open reports of corpses and body parts that needed responding to.  Raqqa was of course the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State (IS) group\u0026rsquos caliphate. It was here that the jihadists carried out their grisly repertoire of hangings, beheadings, torture and sexual slavery.  Given that this was their base and hub, the city bore the brunt of air and artillery strikes by the US and its allies including Britain and France. Throughout this military campaign this coalition force consistently claimed that they precisely targeted IS fighters and positions during the five-month siege that destroyed swathes of the city.  But this week a newly released report entitled \u0026ldquoWar of Annihilation,based on an investigation by human rights group, Amnesty International (AI), comprehensively contradicts such assertions, suggesting the coalition\u0026rsquos campaign of bombardment probably breached international humanitarian law and potentially amount to war crimes.  The report, details the loss of civilian life in Raqqa, based on interviews with 112 civilians at the sites of 42 coalition airstrikes, and its conclusions are damning to say the least  \u0026ldquoThe coalition\u0027s claims that its precision air campaign allowed it to bomb IS out of Raqqa while causing very few civilian casualties do not stand up to scrutiny, said Amnesty\u0027s senior crisis response adviser, Donatella Rovera.  \u0026ldquoOn the ground in Raqqa we witnessed a level of destruction comparable to anything we have seen in decades of covering the impact of wars,Ms Rovera added.  In further comments she went on to quote senior US military officer as saying that \u0026ldquomore artillery shells were launched into Raqqa than anywhere since the end of the Vietnam War.  A spokesman for the US-led coalition meanwhile, slammed Amnesty\u0026rsquos report, saying that the rights group never approached the Pentagon about its findings and was out of line for suggesting the coalition has violated international law.  \u0026ldquoThey are literally judging us guilty until proven innocent, that\u0026rsquos a bold rhetorical move by an organisation that fails to check the public record or consult the accused, Col. Thomas Veale told reporters at the Pentagon via a video briefing from Baghdad.  That the battle to liberate Raqqa, Codenamed the Wrath of Euphrates,was a no quarter military campaign is beyond doubt. That much was clear from the outset when then US Secretary of Defence James Mattis announced the acceleration of operations against IS in May 2017.  \u0026ldquoOur intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow them to do so. We are going to stop them there and take apart the caliphate, Mattis said at the time.  That Raqqa was taken apart in that process is also beyond doubt. According to independent research groups that track American and Russian airstrikes in Syria, US aircraft and artillery bombarded Raqqa with an estimated 20,000 munitions during the five month operation. This is more than was dropped in all of Afghanistan in the whole of 2017.  For now the controversy surrounding the coalition\u0026rsquos actions and Amnesty\u0026rsquos findings is sure to go on. It will be little consolation of course to those Syrians who lost family and loved ones in Raqqa.  But while little can be done for the dead, much can be done for those who survived and right now are struggling to rebuild their lives.  The US-led coalition, Britain included, help wreck the city, but there is precious little evidence that they are willing to take responsibility for putting it back together.  Eight months on the city has no running water or electricity, and there is virtually no help with the dangerous and pressing task of defusing the countless unexploded devices and ordnance around the city that continues to kill and maim civilians.  The volunteer Civil Defence Unit that I accompanied were sometimes scouring the rubble for body parts wearing nothing but thin surgical gloves, while such is the shortages they facethat even the body bags used for their grisly collection are recycled after emptying.  Right now there is humanitarian imperative to help the people of Raqqa. There is one other good reason too why they should not be ignored. For while IS might have been ousted from the city, their cadres still lurk ready and willing to exploit anger and frustration. Wrecking Raqqa was the easy part. Putting peoples lives back together is more difficult. Right now there it not a moment to lose."},{"url":null,"title":"Series of pledges made by Festival as it launches 2018 programme","story":"              THIS year will see the biggest Edinburgh Festival Fringe yet, with more than 3,500 shows, nearly 57,000 performances, and plans for a major revamp of outdoor shows on the Royal Mile.

In a section dedicated to keeping the Fringe affordable for artists, it says: \"The moment Edinburgh becomes too expensive for artists is the moment the Fringe ceases to function.\"  The Society, which runs the festival, is currently based in three buildings, including its well-known shop on the High Street, and Ms McCarthy said it is open to either a new building or utilising a new one for a new base in the capital.  Ms McCarthy said that many of the aspirations in the document is also a \"massive call out for help\" to other major bodies in the city, including the city council, to help deliver the changes.  It also pledges to ensure that artists can attend the Fringe permit-free after Brexit, and says it will freeze participation fees until at least 2022.  It promises to \"seek to increase the availability of affordable accommodation.\"  READ MORE: The end of cash in the hat? Fringe to trial contactless payments  The 2018 Fringe will also feature 697 free shows, 260 \"pay what you want\" events, nearly 2000 premieres, and a series of new venues, including a \"bath bus\", a caravan, and a chicken coop, and the Leith Docker\u0027s Club.  This year will see a relaunch of the street events, which are sponsored by Virgin Money, on the High Street and Mound.  There will be on the Royal Mile, the festival said \"spectacular entrance archways\", new showcases on two major stages, and \"hundreds of brightly coloured pigeons\".  \"The street will look and feel different this year, not only in terms of the look, but in terms of our approach,\" Ms McCarthy said.  \"We are not bringing back Fringe Sunday, but there are elements of it, with every Sunday a 1\u0027o\u0027clock comedy showcase.  \"It will be the street performers, the buskers, but also more of a showcase for the wider Fringe as well - you will see the street itself as a venue.\"  The Blueprint says the festival will have a new expert panel of \"diverse advisors to support artists from black, minority ethnic, working class, disabled and LGBT backgrounds.\"  Ms McCarthy added: \"The Fringe Blueprint identifies new approaches to ensure anyone can participate, regardless of their background.  \"From driving down the cost of attendance to engaging young people in the arts and reaching out to underrepresented groups in Edinburgh and further afield, we want the Fringe to be the greatest festival on earth at which to perform, run a venue, develop a career, see shows and discover talent.\"  READ MORE: Blueprint for the future?

This year the annual festival is to experiment with cashless donations to performers on the city\u0027s Royal Mile during the Fringe.  In an age where contactless payments are becoming more common, the Fringe is to run a trial of such payments for performers on their new stages in the centre of the city this August.  The Fringe is currently considering two options for the payments: a standardised amount which people can then tap with their cashcards on some kind of payment device, or a system with a \"degree of flexibility\" so the audience can pay what they want.  The festival also wants to somehow relate the new cashless payment system to the traditional \"passing around of the hat\" that usually follows a live performance on the Royal Mile.  Oliver Davies, the head of marketing at the festival, said: \"The idea this year is to trial in on four of the stages this year, and roll it out more widely after we see what we get back from it.  \"There will be a transactional fee which we are working with the provider to drive down as much as we can, and again its the kind of thing that if we develop the programme, if we can reduce that figure down even further, then brilliant.\"  Money will be collected into one pot, and then given to performers afterwards, he said.  He added: \"We are trying to get a good mix. Because it\u0027s a trial we want to get a variety of different pay points.  \"So we are going to try and mix it across the landscape, on The Mound as well as the High Street, so that will give it the details we need on how to roll it out.\"  This year the Fringe is also introducing a number of Sensory Backpacks, for children and adults on the autism spectrum.  Each backpack contains a fidget toy, earplugs, a photo story describing the street events, a map, and a list of relaxed performances at the Fringe."},{"url":null,"title":"Sturgeon says conference   39 new chapter on independence  39 ","story":"              THIS week\u0026rsquos SNP conference will \u0026ldquomark the start of a new chapter in Scotland\u0026rsquos road to independence, Nicola Sturgeon has predicted.  In the conference programme, the First Minister said that while other parties argued over past grievances, hers was focused on fulfilling the country\u0026rsquos potential.  Around 2000 delegates are expected at the Aberdeen gathering tomorrow and Saturday, with the first item of business the declaration of a new SNP deputy leader.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos introduction also endorsed the controversial report of the SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission, which has infuriated many on the Left of the Yes movement.  The 354-page document, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said would continue austerity after independence, recommends years of tight public spending to halve Scotland\u0026rsquos deficit and keeping the pound, tying Scotland to UK monetary policy.  There are no plans for a main hall debate on the report, however it is expected to feature in a fringe tomorrow hosted by the Institute of Economic Affairs.  Ms Sturgeon said the report was \u0026ldquopacked full of new ideas for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  The Scottish Tories called on Ms Sturgeon and deputy First Minister John Swinney to admit the 2013 White Paper on independence had been \u0026ldquomisleading and nonsensical.  Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw said the striking change of tack in the Growth Commission showed the White Paper had been a \u0026ldquowork of fiction.  He said: \u0026ldquo\u0026ldquoWill Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney have the courage to be honest and accept they hoodwinked people? Or are they still too afraid of Alex Salmond to question him?  \u0026ldquoThese are the questions that will follow the SNP leadership as they prepare for their conference this weekend. People will be watching to see if they answer.\"  Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said the SNP was running scared of having a full debate on the Growth Commission at its conference because it had turned out to be a \u0026ldquocuts commission.  She said: \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos new blueprint for separation offers a decade of austerity and tax breaks for the richest and their big corporations.  \u0026ldquoGiven how badly it has gone down with Yes supporters and the public, it is no surprise to see the SNP now running scared of discussing it at its conference.  \u0026ldquoBut while Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP put their fingers in their ears, trade unions, experts and think tanks will continue exposing their cuts commission."},{"url":null,"title":"Retailer reveals top toys for Christmas    200 days before the event","story":"              This year\u0026rsquos must-have toys for Christmas have been revealed \u0026ndash 200 days before the event \u0026ndash with unicorns set to feature highly on wishlists.

A poll for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) found more than half of people were planning a trip overseas in the next 12 months, and of those 9% would consider bringing back plants, seeds, bulbs, tubers or cuttings.  It could mean many holidaymakers bringing back plant material in their luggage and raising the risk of importing new pests and diseases that could damage gardens, the RHS said.  While there are some restrictions on importing plants in personal baggage, Britons travelling abroad should avoid bringing back any plants, the RHS urged as it unveiled\u0026nbspthe survey findings during the Chatsworth Flower Show.  British gardens face threats from new plants and diseases from abroad, such as \u0026ldquogame changing bacterium Xylella fastidiosa which can hit more than 350 different types of plant, with lavender,\u0026nbsphebe, rosemary and flowering cherry at high risk.  Fuschia gall mite, which disfigures plants and is now rife in the South East, has been attributed to an enthusiast for the plant illegally importing cuttings from South America.  While clothes, alcohol and fridge magnets are the most common things bought on foreign holidays, plants, flowers, wooden items and seeds are among the\u0026nbsp items those quizzed for the poll say they have brought back.  Plants were bought from garden centres, supermarkets, local markets, or even collected from gardens or the wild.  Nearly a third (31%) of those responding to the survey\u0026nbspof 2,066 people by YouGov are planning trips to Italy, France or Spain in the next 12 months \u0026ndash all countries where Xylella has already been found, the RHS said.  Its call to holidaymakers not to bring back plants from their foreign travels is backed by the Environment Department (Defra), which is launching a Don\u0026rsquot Risk It campaign this summer to raise awareness of the problems of bringing back cut flowers, fruit, vegetables and plant material from holiday spots.  Sue Biggs, director general of the Royal Horticultural Society, said: \u0026ldquoFor many people, wandering the olive groves of Italy and lavender fields of France are as much a part of the holiday experience as the cities and beaches.  \u0026ldquoBut we\u0026rsquore asking people to leave these beautiful plants where they are for future visitors to enjoy and not to bring them back home with them.  \u0026ldquoThis is vital if we are going to win the fight to protect our gardens against the growing threat of pests and diseases.

Mystery surrounds the one-millimetre long creatures that made the prints, since no trace of their bodies has been found.  Scientists believe they may have been a type of arthropod, the family of animals with jointed limbs that includes insects and crustaceans, or something akin to a legged worm.  trackways may be taken as evidence that the movement of their trace maker\u0026rsquos appendages was poorly coordinated source=Dr Shuhai Xiao /]What is known is that the creatures burrowed as well as walked, were \u0026ldquobilaterian \u0026ndash meaning they had pairs of matching appendages \u0026ndash and appear to have been on the clumsy side.

Previously no evidence of limbed animals has been found that pre-dates the \u0026ldquoCambrian Explosion, the sudden surge in diversity that occurred on Earth about 510 \u0026ndash 541 million years ago.
