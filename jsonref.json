A spokesperson said on Tuesday that after all the options had been considered, a decision had been taken that the most efficient way to complete the project and safeguard visitors, staff and the collection was to close completely from 29 June 2020 until spring 2023.London’s loss will be the the rest of the UK’s gain with exhibitions and projects planned with York Art Gallery, the Holburne Museum in Bath, the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle, National Museums Liverpool and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.• Displaying more than 100 royal portraits, ning 500 years from the Tudors to the Windsors, at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.• A series of special projects with its neighbour the National Gallery. That will include the display of Holbein’s preparatory drawing of Henry VIII alongside his painting The Ambassadors – a star of the National Gallery – for the first time.• A continuation of the Coming Home project where portraits are lent to places they are most associated with. In 2020 that will include Florence Nightingale going to Derby, Richard III to York, Malala Yousafzai to Birmingham and Meera Syal to Wolverhampton.• Portrait shows touring to three National Trust properties: Mottisfont in Hampshire, Basildon Park in Berkshire, and Hughenden in Buckinghamshire.• Partnerships with schools and communities across the UK. For example a project exploring steel in Middlesbrough and football in Wembley.Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, called the redevelopment “a unique and important chapter in our history” which would transform the gallery and enable it “to become more welcoming and engaging to all and fulfil our role as the nation’s family album”.He encouraged other organisations to get in touch about working together “to circulate a national collection as widely as possible in both innovative and collaborative ways”.Precisely what will happen to the gallery’s 270 staff during the closure remains to be seen. A spokesperson said: “Closure of the gallery building will necessitate staff changes and inevitably there will be some job losses.“Where possible, staff will be offered part-time working and career break opportunities and the gallery is looking at a range of secondment opportunities with other institutions during the building period.”The FDA, the senior civil service union, said the closure would inevitably lead to potential redundancies, uncertainty and other complications for National Portrait Gallery staff and urged them to join a union to support them through any changes.Closing the gallery entirely is an unusual step, although not without precedents. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam was scheduled to close for three years for its £318m overhaul, one which dragged to 10 years.More than 1.5 million people visited the National Portrait Gallery in 201819 which also raises questions of where they might go, and whether numbers will increase for neighbouring galleries and attractions.The redevelopment project is called Inspiring People, and represents the gallery’s biggest ever redevelopment since the building in St Martin’s Place opened in 1896.The designs, by Jamie Fobert Architects, include a complete refurbishment of the building, the creation of new public spaces and a new learning centre. All that will allow a “comprehensive redisplay” of the collection.One of the most eye catching elements of the redevelopment will be a new grander entrance pointing north, to complement the current narrow entrance which feels to some like entering a Tardis. When the gallery was first built, a rich donor insisted it should not have an entrance pointing north towards the filth of Soho and Covent Garden.The gallery said it had secured £32.7m of its £35.5m target. It includes a £9.4m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a £6.5m grant from the trustees of the Garfield Weston Foundation of a new public wing, currently used as offices."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73bf74eb0b7502ede6380e16aadb68473507ff5e/0_0_5422_3252/master/5422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e38883b8c530eff3707c601ec716f9f","title":"like looking through butterfly wings ira cohens mylar chamber in pictures","story":"In a New York loft 50 years ago, poet, photographer and film-maker Ira Cohen hung reflective Mylar film on hinged boards, walls and ceiling, and invited visitors – including William Burroughs and Jimi Hendrix – to explore an experimental space"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05547f929de2907076ee8e09f1b296545f705ec9/0_0_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0ae704048930aa93689e033c7eba61","title":"discworld dishes moby dick bbc unveils 100 novels that shaped our world","story":"Panel of experts charged with listing the fiction that has affected them most goes for bestsellers as well as literary classicsThere’s no Wuthering Heights, no Moby-Dick, no Ulysses, but there is Half of a Yellow Sun, Bridget Jones’s Diary and Discworld: so announced the panel of experts assembled by the BBC to draw up a list of 100 novels that shaped their world.The choices were made by Stig Abell, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, Syima Aslam, founder of the Bradford literature festival, authors Juno Dawson, Kit de Waal and Alexander McCall Smith and journalist Mariella Frostrup. The list is intended to mark the 200th anniversary of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, widely seen as the progenitor of the English-language novel.The books chosen by the panel are those that have made a personal impact on them, and are ided into 10 categories. These include “love, sex and romance”, which features titles ranging from Jilly Cooper’s Rivals to Judy Blume’s Forever “identity”, which moves from Toni Morrison’s Beloved to Zadie Smith’s White Teeth and “adventure”, which includes Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe and Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep.“So many amazing novels are not on the list,” said Dawson. “As this panel of judges, we’re not qualified to say this is the definitive list, but we are qualified to say these are our favourites. We knew right from the beginning that the role of these lists, almost, is for people to disagree with them … and we could only pick 100 books.”So while there’s no Wuthering Heights, the Brontë sisters do feature on the list with Anne Brontë’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. And while Moby-Dick doesn’t appear, Herman Melville does – with Bartleby, the Scrivener.She added that she had pushed for more children’s and young adult titles to be included on the list, “because if it weren’t for the books we loved as children, we wouldn’t be readers as adults”. So alongside Orlando, Middlemarch and Our Mutual Friend, the list also features The Witches, The Hunger Games, Noughts and Crosses and The Earthsea trilogy.BBC Arts director Jonty Claypole said the list took “months of enthusiastic debate” to put together. “There are neglected masterpieces, irresistible romps as well as much-loved classics. It is a more erse list than any I have seen before, recognising the extent to which the English-language novel is an art form embraced way beyond British shores,” he said.The unveiling of the list launches a year-long celebration of literature at the BBC, headed by the new BBC Two series Novels That Shaped Our World. Beginning on 9 November, the series will explore the novel from the perspective of women’s voices, the empire and working-class experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5813568c3a3370bd625da5a5675bf07c75f904f/0_114_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0313e03724ded737bbd5d84e6959b2be","title":"south western railway staff to strike for nearly all of december","story":"Half of all timetabled trains could be hit as RMT union names 27 stoppage days in rowRail workers on one of Britain’s biggest commuter networks, South Western Railway, are set to go on strike for almost all of December.The RMT union announced a total of 27 days of action for next month in the long-running dispute over the future role of guards on trains.Previous stoppages, over shorter periods, forced South Western to cut about half of timetabled services. A longer strike would likely mean even greater disruption in the run-up to Christmas.The union accused the train operator of failing to honour a potential deal, reached after a long standoff. It said South Western would not give assurances over the role of guards.Strikes will run from 2 December until new year, breaking only for the general election on 12 December, and for Christmas Day and Boxing Day – when there are no trains running anyway. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “Our members have been left with no choice but to call a further 27 days of strike action on South Western Railway.“At the last meeting we held with SWR principles in agreements were made in good faith with the company’s negotiating team and we now feel hugely let down again. As long as the company continues to refuse to give assurances on the future operational role of the guard we will remain in dispute.”He said the union remained available for talks.South Western Railway serves an average of 600,000 passenger journeys daily, operating out of Britain’s busiest railway station, London Waterloo, to regions including Surrey and Hampshire.The ongoing dispute over guards and driver-controlled operation of trains, which prompted prolonged industrial action at Southern, has spread to networks including Northern, Merseyrail and most recently West Midlands Trains.The RMT has called its members out on strike for seven consecutive Saturdays in November and December on West Midlands, which includes the local West Midlands Railway and longer-distance London Northwestern Railway services.

However, opposition sources said the government had been slapped down by senior civil servants, forcing an embarrassing U-turn.In an email exchange seen by the , the Cabinet Office told the party: “To confirm our conversation, these costings will not be published.”A Labour source said: “This is an embarrassing slapdown to Tory ministers who were blatantly trying to use the civil service for political purposes.”The Whitehall intervention comes after McDonnell personally complained to the Treasury’s senior mandarin, Sir Tom Scholar, about the use of the civil service for political ends hours before the planned launch of the costings.The shadow chancellor made the complaint after weekend press reports that said the Conservatives would publish official costings of Labour’s spending plans on Tuesday – the last day before purdah pre-election restrictions on the use of the civil service come into force.Previous governments have used the Treasury machine to criticise opposition party spending plans. George Osborne used a dossier of civil service reports to attack Ed Miliband’s policies in 2015, although its publication was in the January of that year, significantly ahead of the May 2015 election.Labour has ramped up its policy announcements in recent days, including promises to end rough sleeping and a pledge to remove all traces of privatisation from the NHS.Labour’s plans for wide-scale nationalisation came under scrutiny last month from the Confederation of British Industry, which warned the scheme would cost almost £200bn.

A figure above 50 indicates growth.The modest increase from September reflected reports from some firms of optimism about a resolution to the wrangling over Brexit in the new year following the election.But with the manufacturing and construction sectors in recession, the lack of growth in the services sector meant the economy was suffering its worst period since the 2008 financial crash, said IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson.The trade body said the decline was driven by a big drop in private purchases, suggesting that consumers are nervous about making major purchases.The SMMT blamed “a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continued to impact confidence”.“The growth in alternatively fuelled cars is very welcome, showing increasing buyer appetite for these new technologies,” Hawes said.“The overall market remains tough, however, with October now the year’s eighth month of decline and in need of an injection of confidence.”Williamson said private sector output was going through its worst period for a decade: “Contractions have now been recorded in four of the past five months, marking the worst spell since 2009 during the global financial crisis.” The seasonally-adjusted IHS MarkitCIPS all-sector output index rose from 48.8 in September to 49.5 in October. That was a weaker rate of contraction, but the survey also found that the volume of new business fell at a pace similar to that in September.“While official data may indicate more robust growth in the third quarter, the PMI warns that some of this could merely reflect a payback from a steeper decline than signalled by the surveys in the second quarter, and that the underlying business trend remains one of stagnation at best,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f536149f6aece9a9a3bdbc44c7a11814a5dd2b9/0_460_5740_3445/master/5740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5075e56948237596c7789e7328f1870b","title":"green streets which city has the most trees","story":"Urban trees offer huge benefits for climate regulation and personal wellbeing – and cities from Tampa to Frankfurt are intent on boosting their numbersThe Florida city of Tampa claims a number of firsts: the world’s largest pirate festival America’s longest continuous sidewalk (at 4.5 miles) and Babe Ruth’s longest ever home run (587 feet).Tampa won’t be entering the Guinness Book of Records quite yet however. The Treepedia study is not designed to be comprehensive – it only features 27 cities that MIT researchers selected out of curiosity to see how very different places compare (it has since made its code freely available online so others can calculate their own city’s tree coverage).However, it reflects a growing awareness of the value of urban trees. City-dwellers have always appreciated tree cover, a fact recognised in the premium prices for properties on tree-lined streets and those adjacent to leafy parks. As the world becomes both hotter and increasingly urbanised, the importance of trees for both climate regulation and personal wellbeing is increasingly well-recognised.“We are seeing a surge in attention around urban trees around the world … not just because they are beautiful, but because cities realise that trees are an important part of resiliency, health, wellness, happiness, economic benefit – the list goes on,” says Dan Lambe, president at the charity Arbor Day, whose Tree City USA initiative has more than 3,400 registered communities.Last year, the scheme went global.One of the main motivations behind the MIT ranking was to ascertain how trees help mitigate the so-called heat island effect in cities.Ranking cities by tree coverage remains an imprecise science, however. The Treepedia study looks at the amount of green pereceived while walking along roads and the green spaces people interact with on a daily basis, rather than measuring the total number of trees. It draws on visual data from Google’s Street View service, which registers trees visible from the tech giant’s roving, camera-laden vehicles. Meanwhile, a new, as yet unpublished, study takes a completely different approach to measuring tree canopy and arrives at very different conclusions. However, Simone Borelli, an urban forestry expert at the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), cautions against focusing too much on absolute figures. Access to trees, not their quantity, is what really matters, he argues. Can city-dwellers sense, see or, ideally, touch the trees in their city?Germany excels in this respect, with three in four urban residents living within 300 metres of a leafy green space – and in Frankfurt, the average drops to a remarkable 99 metres.Frankfurt was even named European City of Trees in 2014 in recognition of the care it takes of its trees. It has around 200,000 of them in public spaces, as well as Frankfurt City Forest, which covers around 5,800 hectares in the south of the city and is protected from being used for infrastructure projects or buildings. It is part of the city’s so-called Grüngürtel (“green belt”), situated in the middle of the metropolitan area, consists of woodland, agricultural areas, gardens, parks, sports areas, orchards and nature reserves.Mayor of Frankfurt Peter Feldmann said: “The importance of the Grüngürtel for the people of Frankfurt is such that the city council decided unanimously to protect it from building development back in November 1991. We are very proud of that fact. This provision was made possible because the city of Frankfurt owns two thirds of the total 8000 ha surface of the Grüngürtel.”But what makes tree coverage in the these forested cities higher than in others?Clearly, climatic conditions exert a huge influence. All but two of the Forest Services’ top-10 forested cities, for example, are in locations propitious for tree growth. The exceptions are Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Buenos Aires in Argentina, both of which occupy grassland-like geographies.But putting tree planting and management high on a city’s policy agenda is equally important, argues Dr Leong Chee Chiew, commissioner of parks and recreation, National Parks Board (NParks), in Singapore. “Singapore is today well regarded internationally for our clean and green living environment. This is the result of over five decades of conscientious planning and commitment at greening our city-state, starting from the very early years of our nation-building.”Provision for greenery is built into the city’s development plans so the number of trees and green spaces increase in tandem with urbanisation, he adds. For example, when a road is being planned there’s a requirement for verges to be set aside for tree planting.There are about 7 million trees in Singapore, approximately 3 million of which are along streets, in parks, residential and industrial estates. And NParks has stepped up efforts in recent years by planting more than 50,000 trees a year along roadsides, and in parks and gardens.“This sustained effort in greening has made Singapore a biophilic City in a Garden, with an environment that improves the overall physiological and psychological well-being of all Singaporeans,” says Chee Chiew.Even in densely populated or climatically unfavourable locations, prioritising trees can go a long way. The FAO’s Borelli points to the example of Milan, where the city’s main polytechnic is spearheading a drive to plant 3 million trees between now and 2030 – one for each resident of the city’s metropolitan area.Such en masse planting trees comes at a high price. China is ploughing millions of dollars into its Beautiful China reforestation policy. However, urban trees can be sacrificed to other pressures facing city authorities.The US city of Atlanta (still referred to as a “city in a forest”) was stripped of around 560,000 acres of trees between 1973 and 1999 to make way for houses, roads and retail parks, leading to localised spikes in temperature and smog.Another case in point, environmentalists argue, is the proposed £88bn fast-rail HS2 project in Britain. In September, green campaign groups called on the pending clearance of ancient woodlands to be paused until the results of an independent review are published.“HS2 has already destroyed dozens of ancient London plane trees and priceless green spaces,” the broadcaster and campaign spokesperson Chris Packham said. “It’s an insane act of eco-vandalism.”﻿Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3e81d067e7ae6ff3d12a0384c0d86a0bd717ad5/0_337_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd4adef886adf378bc3fcc062f2f97f2","title":"brexit election british politics","story":"The Conservatives have been in government for nine years, but Boris Johnson seems not to feel the weight of that incumbency. He is seeking his first national mandate as prime minister, so doesn’t see himself as a shop-soiled candidate. But he is asking voters to return his party to office for a third time, and it wasn’t much loved to begin with.Labour has the opposite problem. There is plenty of hunger for a new direction in government, but the appetite is dulled by the sight of Jeremy Corbyn asking to be prime minister. It is risky to serve a dish that the electorate has sent back to the kitchen once already.Both of the biggest parties are trying to sell messages of renewal with messengers who are familiar and unpopular. Polls give the Tories a head start, but there is wind behind the opposition in a campaign when even the government admits it is time for a change.Johnson’s claim to be the candidate for a fresh start is contained tenuously in his promise of a swift end to the Brexit saga. He would implement his deal and a burden would thus be lifted from the nation’s shoulders. The prime minister argues that Labour’s policy is to avoid having a policy, deferring the choice, prolonging the pain, which is true enough. The brighter the spotlight on Corbyn’s fence-sitting, the wobblier Labour look.But Johnson has a tricky job selling his plan while also trying to insulate it from scrutiny. He wants people to know there is a deal, but not to care what is in it. There is a flaw in the strategy that makes Brexit the central issue, while running on a platform that appeals to public weariness with the topic. That problem feeds back into the incumbency issue. There is something dissonant in a campaign that says vote for me so we can end this nightmare that I told you would be brilliant vote for the Tories to move on from the only thing Tories seem to care about. Hardline Conservative Eurosceptics have so much pent-up revolutionary frustration, they think they haven’t even started yet. That blinds them to the possibility that the public are tired of having them around.A six-week campaign is long enough for those contradictions to show, especially with Nigel Farage flapping around drawing attention to them. His claim that Johnson’s deal does not effect a clean enough break is ridiculous – it is a severe separation – but the Brexit party had nowhere to go but harder still. And its target audience has been groomed by Tory radicals to feel betrayed by anything that postpones the gratifying instant of rupture. Already Johnson is being tested on post-Brexit transitional arrangements. He says they won’t have to be extended beyond December 2020.They will. A free-trade agreement with Brussels cannot be negotiated by the end of next year. The going rate is more like five years. Under Johnson’s plan, a miserably familiar landscape sweeps into view: Brexiteers pretending something impossible is easy, ruling out compromise and denouncing as traitors any who counsel delay. Meet the new rows over Europe, same as the old ones.The Liberal Democrats have correctly identified article 50 revocation as the efficient way to settle the technical question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it is not something any government likely to be formed after this election could reasonably do, as Jo Swinson must know. The politics of aborting Brexit are as gruesome as the economics of going through with it. There is no good outcome now, only different routes to realising that it was a stupid idea in the first place.With a sustained display of incompetence, cowardice, delusion and ideological mania, British politics has created a situation so monstrous and writhing with venom that the public cannot bear to look at it. Brexit is like the mythical Gorgon that turns to stone all who meet its gaze. It must instead be stalked indirectly, using the monster’s reflection in their polished shield.That is why the election will be only obliquely about Brexit. It will not feature rational evaluation of Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe. These campaigns never do. The referendum drove big red and blue buses down every social fault line in the country without arriving at a functional definition of Brexit. The 2017 election was more animated by fox-hunting and dementia care than customs unions and regulatory alignment. Even when politics appears to be about Brexit, it conspires to be about something else: jostling for position in a Tory leadership race pro-remain guerrilla manoeuvres in the remote hills of Commons procedure.With parliament dissolved, anything relating to the substance of negotiation in Brussels will fall off the agenda because it is a boring subject for most voters and always has been. Meanwhile, neither of the two candidates to be prime minister is going to offer an honest appraisal of why leaving has been so difficult and why it brings no material benefit to the country.There will be ample talk of something called Brexit, but that word will continue to be a proxy for grievances only tangentially connected to EU membership. Or it will be a tint on the lens through which other issues – the NHS, crime, education – will be projected. If British politics was capable of sustaining a focus on the banal reality of continental integration it would have happened by now. And of all the climates in which to cultivate measured debate on the subject, a frenzied, polarised election campaign is the least hospitable. We will get to the end of it and, whatever the result, the monstrous tangle of ugly Brexit choices will still be there. The Gorgon will not be slain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc685fad277b5092f47dad6f1049985fb77c762/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2a794211a9f6d905774bdf23d481713","title":"food bank britain trussell trust report election","story":"A Trussell Trust report details shocking levels of poverty, driven by a benefits system that has tossed large swathes of the public asideDepending on who you listen to, the stakes of this election couldn’t be more different. Believe the panic of the super-rich reportedly preparing to flee the UK if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister, and the vote is a threat to billionaires’ “quality of life”. Read the groundbreaking report from the Trussell Trust released today and it could come down to something altogether more elemental: whether families can afford to eat.The explosion of food banks over the past decade is about more than just hunger – it’s about what sort of society Britain has become. It’s one where 14 million people are living in poverty and workers can earn wages while still facing homelessness. It’s one where more than half of children are growing up below the breadline in some neighbourhoods, and teachers find pupils sleeping rough behind bins. Mass destitution has flourished under a sticking-plaster welfare state. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks. Now it’s 424.The thing about the normalisation of hardship is that it’s only a matter of time before something that once horrified a nation is allowed to get worse. Years after food banks went from a temporary blip to a staple of most towns and cities, it’s now standard practice for some to give out “cold boxes”: tinned groceries that can be eaten without the need for hot water or heating. Volunteers noticed some people would collect a box of pasta and rice only to admit it was useless to them – once they got home, they wouldn’t be able to afford to switch on their cooker or kettle. Other food banks tell me they are now doing a “delivery service” to disabled people who are starving but too ill to leave the house to get an emergency food parcel.If this seems obscene, it’s because it is obscene. But what should be our greatest concern is that in one of the richest nations on earth, such horror is now an accepted part of life. One of the most pervasive myths in modern society has long been that gross inequality is natural – that the best and brightest can quite rightly become billionaires while others, typically due to their own failings, will always go hungry. The Trussell Trust research is a skewer to this fallacy. It shows the biggest driver of food bank use is a benefits system that has undergone such disastrous “reforms” in recent years, from cuts to the value of social security payments and delays in universal credit to people being rejected for disability benefits. Forget families too idle to “manage their finances”, this is a wheelchair user wrongly found “fit for work” or a care worker in crisis because she’s just been evicted.For all the complexities of poverty, the conversation around food banks is quite simple. More and more people are reliant on these services because all avenues of a dignified and secure way to feed themselves have been cut off – whether that’s a competent benefits system, affordable housing or an economy where workers can earn a wage they’re able to live on. These are not unfathomable problems beyond our grasp but ones that have clear enough causes and solutions. There is hope in this, if we wish to find it. Just as hardship has been created by ministers who have been willing to toss large swathes of the public aside, it can be lifted by a political class that decides they matter.As the UK heads into a make-or-break election, rightwing pundits are predictably already out in force with the cliches – spending pledges are too expensive, fair taxes would be disruptive to the wealthy, the safety net is working. But the more they feel the need to defend how things are, the more tangible real change feels. The greatest trick a government can play is convincing the electorate that their suffering is inevitable. It should be the unwritten slogan of the election: Food Bank Britain is not the best we can do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1473ea99027271d3b9edeb6aef037de5c7e81bd5/0_0_5146_3088/master/5146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0b38a7ebf46588e987d136ed830a0d","title":"alarming chinese meddling at uk universities exposed in report","story":"Chinese embassy appears to be coordinating efforts to curb academic freedom, say MPsUniversities are not adequately responding to the growing risk of China and other “autocracies” influencing academic freedom in the UK, the foreign affairs select committee has said.The report, rushed out before parliament is suspended pending the election, finds “alarming evidence” of Chinese interference on UK campuses, adding some of the activity seeking to restrict academic freedom appears to be coordinated by the Chinese embassy in London.The report says: “There is clear evidence that autocracies are seeking to shape the research agenda or curricula of UK universities, as well as limit the activities of researchers on university campuses. Not enough is being done to protect academic freedom from financial, political and diplomatic pressure.”The committee highlighted the role of China-funded Confucius Institutes officials in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference, the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference and evidence that dissidents active while studying in the UK, such as Ayeshagul Nur Ibrahim, an Uighur Muslim, were being monitoring and her family in China being harassed.The committee accuses some academic organisations, such as Million Plus, which represents 20 modern universities, of complacency.Bill Rammell, the chair of Million Plus, told the committee he had “not heard one piece of evidence” that substantiated claims of foreign influence in universities.The committee said the government’s focus was on protecting universities from intellectual property theft and risks arising from joint research projects. “This is not enough to protect academic freedom from other types of interference such as financial, political or diplomatic pressure,” the MPs said.The Foreign Office’s evidence to the committee highlighted the lack of government advice to universities, the report says, adding ministers have not coordinated approaches to the issue, either within Whitehall or with foreign governments such as Australia and the US.The report points out that a 2019 international education strategy white paper mentions China more than 20 times in the context of boosting education expertise to the Chinese market, but with no mention of security or interference.The committee concluded: “The battle for university students or trade deals should not outweigh the international standards which have brought freedom and prosperity to the UK and the wider world. The government should provide any strategic advice to universities and not used its key sanction tools such as ‘Magnitsky powers’ to curb interference on human rights grounds.”Ministers can curb interference through the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act passed 17 months ago, the report said.However, ministers previously told the committee they could not use the so-called Magnitsky amendment, contained in the act, until the UK had left the EU. In June the FCO finally admitted this interpretation was legally incorrect, and the powers could be used independently of the EU while still an EU member.The FCO has still to lay the necessary statutory instrument to introduce the power, 17 months after the act became law. The foreign affairs select committee pointed out that the power, touted by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in pre-Conservative party conference interviews, will be delayed still further by the general election.The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, also asked the FCO to explain its failure to use sanctions in response to repression by state authorities in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.On the question of Hong Kong, where violent protests continue and local elections are due to be held later this month, the committee has urged the government to assess the reputational damage to the UK of British judges continuing to sit on the Hong Kong court of final appeal. The committee warns there is a danger of the UK appearing to be complicit in supporting and participating in a system that is undermining the rule of law.In a bid to support the protesters, the UK should grant residency to Hong Kong citizens who are British national (overseas) passport holders, the report said.Tugendhat said hard-won freedoms were under threat in the UK. The FCO had been “found wanting in three policy areas: autocracies’ influence on academic freedom the use of sanctions against autocratic states and their supporters, and the UK’s cooperation with other democracies in responding to autocracies”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b188bbdba2a6ecafeb58beda379c1cddc9d4e8ab/0_0_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=897ab869cbf269473e3483372f37bd20","title":"restoring jamaicas lost coral reefs photo essay","story":"by Christina Larson. Photographs by David J Phillip and David GoldmanAPEverton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of colour for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. That is where he is heading. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the “coral nursery”. Simpson started working as a “coral gardener” two years ago as part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaica’s coral reefs back from the brink.On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes. Simpson and other ers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners look after a flower bed, painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to inidually transplant on to a reef. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year.A few hours later, at a site called Dickie’s Reef, Simpson es again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral on to rocky outcroppings, a temporary binding until the coral’s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself on to the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And, so far, it is working.With fish and coral, it is a co-dependent relationship. The fish rely on the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and also eat up the coral’s rivals. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers, and vice versa.The delicate labour of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef and for all its intricacy it is actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavours.Slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. “The coral are coming back, the fish are coming back,” says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. “It’s probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs we’ve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself. It’s not too late.”Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead was that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.At White River, which is only about two years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs, as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them.Jamaica’s coral reefs were once among the world’s most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident brightly coloured fish drawing the attention of travellers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island’s northern coast in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The groundbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared.Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points towards the reef crest about 300 metres (985ft) away, a thin brown line splashed with white waves. “Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral,” he says. Then several disasters struck.The first calamity was 1980’s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. “Its 40ft waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef,” Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters but only when given a chance to recover, which it never got.“There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system,” Gayle says. “Scientists call it a ‘phase shift’.”That seemed like the end of the story until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction, with help from residents such as Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey.The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter of a mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step on to a 28ft motorboat called the Interceptor.Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea is not emptied too quickly.In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area, a “fish sanctuary”, for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught.Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent however, to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor.On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked “no fishing”. ‘‘We are looking for violators,” Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. “Sometimes you find spearmen. They think they’re smart. We try to beat them at their game.”Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men, some of them poor and with few options, are the most likely trespassers.The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. “Let them understand this. It’s not a ‘you’ thing or a ‘me’ thing. This isn’t personal,” Bailey says of past encounters with violators.These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel fish sanctuary, ended up in hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally. “He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job, telling him he cannot fish in the protected area,” she says.Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she is not going to stop. “Public mindsets can change,” she says. “If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something.”She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and the confiscation of equipment.One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighbourhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far.Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spear fisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, when many people said they were trying to stop their livelihood.Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. “It’s easier to catch snapper and barracuda,” he says. “At least my great-grandkids will get to see some fish.”When Columbus landed in Jamaica he sailed into Oracabessa Bay, which is today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay fish sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaica’s coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010 and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions.“The fishermen are mostly on board and happy, that’s the distinction. That’s why it’s working,” says the sanctuary manager, Inilek Wilmot.David Murray, the head of the Oracabessa Fishers’ Association, notes that Jamaica‘s 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. “Fishing is like gambling, it’s a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you don’t,” he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbours.“It’s people work, it’s a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary,” he says. “It’s a tough job to tell a man who’s been fishing all his life that he can’t fish here.”But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the inidual fish have grown larger, nearly tripling in length on average, according to annual surveys by Jamaica’s national environment and planning agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice.“We have the data to show success but even more important than data is word of mouth,” says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River.Morrow, a lifelong water sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog, Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers’ meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns.“We all depend on the ocean,” Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. “If we don’t have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea.”This Associated Press feature was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s department of science education.

China and India are cleaning up their energy systems but their surging economies mean emissions will continue to grow for a decade.Only the 28 countries of the European Union and a few others including Norway, Switzerland and Ukraine are on track. Of the 184 national Paris pledges made, 136 are judged insufficient in the report, published by the Universal Ecological Fund.Another problem is many pledges are unlikely to be met, due to the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, reversing environmental policies, or because poorer nations do not get the funding they need – the US and Australia have stopped making such contributions.“The current pledges made under the Paris agreement are totally inadequate to put us on a pathway to meet either the 1.5C or the 2C goal,” said the report’s author, Prof Sir Robert Watson, a former IPCC chair and scientific adviser to the UK and US governments. “With just 1C warming so far, we are already seeing some very significant effects. The effects at 3-4C will be very profound on people around the world.”“When you see a country like Russia not even putting a pledge on the table, it is extremely disturbing,” he said. “Saudi Arabia and Russia rely heavily on their fossil fuels but that is no excuse. Those that have not effectively made any pledges yet really should be shamed into being part of the solution.”Harvard University’s James McCarthy, a co-author of the report, said: “Failing to reduce emissions drastically and rapidly will result in an environmental and economic disaster from human-induced climate change.”Failing to halve emissions by 2030 means the number of hurricanes, severe storms, wildfires and droughts are likely double in number and intensity, the scientists said, costing $2bn (£1,55bn) a day within a decade. To avoid this, the scale of climate change action must double or triple, they said.Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.The Paris agreement does allow for nations to ratchet up their commitments. “This report demonstrates we need to ratchet badly, and as quickly as possible,” said Watson.China and India should be applauded for improving their energy systems, he said, but their emissions must peak. However, Watson said it was difficult to expect leadership from these nations when those with the biggest historical emissions, like the US, were not doing so.“Leaders need to adopt new policies to close coal-fired power plants and promote renewable and carbon-free power sources such as wind, solar and hydropower,” said McCarthy. That means closing 2,400 coal-fired power stations around the world in the next decade and tackling the 250 new coal-powered units that are under construction.Improved energy efficiency is also critical, said co-author Prof Nebojsa Nakicenovic, at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, potentially saving households around the world $500bn a year in energy bills.From cars to homes to industry, he said, the potential of energy efficiency was so great that if implemented no extra energy would be required in 2030, despite the fact that global population was expected to be 1.2bn higher than today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

Italian fashion house Gucci announced it would go fur-free in 2017 and auction off all its remaining animal fur items. In 2018, London fashion week became the first of the big fashion events to commit to banning fur. When Prada announced it would stop using fur in its collections in May, activists hoped the move would reignite a campaign that had taken its foot off the pedal. Most recently, Macy’s announced it would stop selling fur items by February 2021, making it the biggest US retailer to do so, and last month California became the first US state to ban animal fur products.Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society International, called the Queen’s decision to “go faux” from now on “the perfect reflection of the mood of the British public, the vast majority of whom detest cruel fur, and want nothing to do with it”.Her Majesty is no stranger to fur – she wore leopard-skin stoles in the 1950s and attended the opera draped in fur in the 40s.Peta used the news to call on the Queen to rethink the fur worn by members of the Queen’s Guard and “complete the policy by ordering that the fur be replaced by the humane, luxurious faux bearskin that Peta has helped develop alongside faux-furrier Ecopel and designer Stella McCartney”. The Humane Society International called on the government to make the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of fur.Kelly’s book has also brought to light claims that the royal dresser wears in the Queen’s shoes before engagements, “to ensure they are comfortable and that she is always good to go” that the Queen requested to say the line “Good evening, Mr Bond” when she appeared alongside Daniel Craig during the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, and that she was very happy to share a hug  with Michelle Obama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882058cd766c4378125e0e0f30189e01c226c455/0_131_1785_1071/master/1785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02dc5a49ec6fc9bcdb3e337ee21de781","title":"martin scorsese marvel movies the irishman","story":"I didn’t think I could love The Irishman director more after reading his wise words about what is and isn’t cinema, but I’m still a huge fan of superhero films• Scorsese on superhero movies: ‘The situation fills me with terrible sadness’When Martin Scorsese makes a judgment about what is and isn’t cinema, film writers sit up and listen. Or we ought to. And British writers ought to listen to him with special humility and respect. In the 70s, this great American artist and passionate cine connoisseur single-handedly revived and preserved the reputation of the great English director Michael Powell and his great collaborations with Emeric Pressburger when this country had been content to neglect Powell for decades.So whatever your view on what I think of as the false opposition of Scorsese v Marvel, it is invigorating to read his article in today’s New York Times, in which he eloquently, and with inimitable wisdom and good humour, explains and amplifies his personal view (originally expressed in an off-the-cuff remark to Britain’s Empire magazine) that Marvel movies and by implication superhero franchise movies generally are not cinema – though he concedes that many are made by people of “considerable talent and artistry” – because they are closer to theme park rides, soullessly focus-grouped and market tested, lacking the humanising signature of the inidual artist and without “mystery, revelation or genuine emotional danger”.Many would agree with Scorsese and many have agreed, though critics all over the world, aware that their praise for both Scorsese and recent superhero films is on the record, and hitherto unaware that they might be asked to choose, have been charier of commenting. Scorsese’s words certainly come at an interesting time: the huge box-office hit Joker (a DC, not Marvel figure) contains pedantic and self-admiring allusions to Scorsese’s The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver – gifs that for me only reveal that particular film’s bumptious inferiority to Scorsese films.Scorsese’s article is a great piece of writing, especially when he talks about seeing great films for the first time. I didn’t think I could love Scorsese more than I do, but you have to, after reading his words about seeing Hitchcock’s Psycho at a midnight show when it was first released. It’s great to think of the 18-year-old Scorsese – with hair and beard starting to grow long, maybe – vibrating with excitement and wonder in the auditorium.As for his views themselves, only someone very presumptuous is going to say he’s wrong. I myself offer qualifying thoughts. The question of what isn’t cinema and what is an enemy to cinema, is changing all the time. Until very recently, the consensus of opinion was that the great evil was not Marvel (which at least believed in big-screen spectacle and getting crowds of people into cinemas) but Netflix, and how awful to think that people were being encouraged to watch films on their smartphones etc.But it was the streaming giant Netflix that distributed Alfonso Cuarón’s masterpiece Roma and has bankrolled Scorsese’s magnificent new picture and late-period masterpiece The Irishman, though at the expense of limiting a big-screen release. As Scorsese remarks: “Would I like the picture to play on more big screens for longer periods of time? Of course I would.” I have always thought some anti-Netflix, small-screen rhetoric was overplayed, especially as most of us encountered classic movies first on TV – Scorsese himself has written about a regular TV slot called Million Dollar Movie, which introduced him as a kid to cinema – and we all continue to enjoy movies on TV as well as the big screen. For what it’s worth, I think the bigger threat is “motion smoothing” on plasma TVs, recently denounced by Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie, which makes all films look like daytime TV.As for superhero films, I hugely enjoy them as melodrama, spectacle, craziness and fantasy: for me, in these terms, they really are cinema. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the slo-mo sequence in X-Men: Days of Future Past, with Quicksilver dashing around catching bullets, to the melancholy accompaniment of Jim Croce’s Time in a Bottle is pure cinematic inspiration. Thor: Ragnarok is a great comedy and Black Panther is a terrific action drama. Superhero franchises are market-tested, of course, but then audience testing has been a part of Hollywood cinema since the 1920s. And so often, watching yet another middlebrow, sanitised, awards-bait biopic, I feel that it’s this – not Marvel or DC – that is the umpteenth franchise iteration. And we should beware of dismissing genre. Westerns were once looked down on as inferior product that offered the same old personae and plots. Now they are treasured for their mythic potency.And as for superhero movies crowding out other types of movies – well, I’m not sure. Those other films are there, and independent movies have always complained about studio behemoths sucking up the oxygen. No one should make Captain America or Doctor Strange their alibi for failing to know or care about other types of cinema. If we want creative ersity in the movies – that vital proliferation of artistic signature that Scorsese proclaims – then critics have to contribute by discovering and promoting new young film-makers. Scorsese has done his job, by making another outstanding film.

The European champions have given a commitment to the EFL to field a team in the quarter-finals “that is largely consistent with those that have participated in earlier rounds of this season’s competition” and meets the competition’s selection requirements. Regulation 6.5 states: “Each club shall play its full available strength in and during all cup competition matches, unless some satisfactory reason is given.”Klopp handed five youngsters their home debuts in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal in the fourth round but also started players who would be expected to feature in Qatar – James Milner, Divock Origi, Joe Gomez, Naby Keïta, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana. Liverpool could field a similar side at Villa and fly first-team regulars to Qatar afterwards for their second CWC game on 21 December.No final decisions have been made on the composition of Klopp’s squads or on whether the manager will oversee both matches, although that is unlikely.The EFL’s football services director, Dave Cookson, said: “The EFL has long acknowledged this competition provides those clubs with large resources with the opportunity to rotate their squads knowing that teams who wish to be successful have to be prepared to play a large amount of matches over the course of the season.“Therefore, in these exceptional circumstances the decision was taken having received clear assurances from the club that there will be a level of consistency in team selection, a feature which is key to ensuring integrity is maintained. We recognise the challenges Liverpool face in this matter and appreciate the efforts made to find a practical solution.”Liverpool said in a statement : “The club would like to take this opportunity to underline that, while this is not an ideal scenario, it is an outcome which was arrived at with the best interests of the competition, our fellow clubs and ourselves as the sole motivating factor.“We would like to thank the EFL for their efforts to accommodate us and we can confirm alternative dates were discussed but, ultimately, none were considered suitable without compromising the scheduling of the competition itself or placing an undue strain on our playing staff.”Klopp had ruled out the possibility of playing on the 17 and 18 December on the basis he needed a full squad in Qatar. He said on Friday: “It’s not that we can go there with 11 players and say: ‘These 11 guys play the two games in Qatar and the other guys play at home in England against Aston Villa.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16e446097d7211d2c53f37bddce00716b5ccb199/823_964_3310_1986/master/3310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3170c2206409e2a7f1b649a23731d33","title":"chelsea v ajax champions league live","story":"Chelsea will play in their famous blue shirts. Their current patterned tops have a vague retro whiff about them. Hey, any old excuse to whack up a picture of Stamford Bridge back in the day, pitchside car park and all. Here’s everyone celebrating promotion from the old Second Division in 1989. Left to right: Ford Escort, Austin Maxi, Graham Roberts, Kevin Wilson, Peter Nicholas, Micky Hazard, Volkswagen Polo. Two players will miss the next match if they’re booked: Ajax goalkeeper-captain Andre Onana and midfielder Lisandro Martinez. Chelsea can pick up as many yellow cards as they fancy.Marcos Alonso returns to the Chelsea starting XI. He replaces Emerson, the only change made to the side named at Watford three days ago. N’Golo Kante is back from injury and on the bench. Neither Ross Barkley nor Olivier Giroud are in the squad, respectively unfit and unloved.Ajax make two changes to the team sent out in Amsterdam two weeks ago. Noussair Mazraoui replaces Sergino Dest at right back, while David Neres takes Hakim Ziyech’s place in the front three Ziyech shifts back to replace Edson Alvarez in midfield.Welcome to the ’s coverage of the game that could decide who wins Group H. Not that topping the group makes much difference in the long run. Not if you’re any good. Which both of these sides unquestionably are.Chelsea, the reigning Europa League champions, are in fine fettle right now. They’ve won their last seven Premier League and Champions League matches, playing some delightfully open football along the way. At the weekend, they could have won by ten goals at Watford. They also very nearly drew the match 2-2. They’re that sort of team now. Kevin Keegan would approve.Ajax, the reigning Dutch champions who fell two seconds short from last season’s Champions League final, are in rude health too. Erik ten Hag’s team are already well clear at the top of the Ereise, and so far this season they’ve put four or more goals past Emmen, VVV-Venlo, Sparta Rotterdam, Heerenveen, Fortuna Sittard, PEC Zwolle and arch-rivals Feyenoord.Ajax’s only defeat in this campaign to date came against Chelsea in the Amsterdam Arena a fortnight ago. So they’ll be looking to avenge that, and take one giant step towards the Round of 16. But of course young Chelsea have the exact same agenda. So given both teams’ attacking nature, plus Chelsea’s slightly shaky defence, we could have a breezy high-scorer on our hands here. Then again, the match in Amsterdam ended 0-1, so no promises. But it’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a6c5932d3b0e5bdbdd2c4b384cd0643ef9d1907/0_141_4656_2794/master/4656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a89a00ab2479a165d2271c32e83b7d1","title":"liverpool v genk champions league live","story":"Alisson speaks, and says others raise seem to raise their game against Liverpool. “Everyone looks at us as the champions so when we go to the pitch, everyone wants to beat us,” he says. “I always have a big expectation on me all my life, so all of my life I have dealt with that. I just need to show my best on the pitch for my supporters and the team to achieve big things. I think I did really good last season and I want to do that again and, if possible, even better. We gave everything on the pitch last season and will try to do that again. Why not?”Obviously we are only thinking about Genk – but Pep Guardiola did stoke a fire with those comments about Mané and ing. Jürgen Klopp’s riposte? To touch on Manchester City’s tactical fouls and defend his man, of course. “I don’t understand these types of things,” Klopp says. “My brain is not big enough to think about another team as well. I have enough to do to think about us.”Team news news: Jürgen Klopp makes six changes, with James Milner filling in at left-back in the absence of Andy Robertson, who is given a breather ahead of the big one on Sunday. The Scot is on the bench, alongside Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino, though Klopp will hope he does not have to call on any of the trio. Divock Origi gets the nod up front and Fabinho in midfield, while Oxlade-Chamberlain will play out wide and Gomez replaces Lovren. Hopefully no Genk supporters have rocked up in Illinois or New South Wales expecting to watch their team turn over Jürgen Klopp’s side at Anfield. Two Liverpool supporters missed their 4-1 victory in Belgium last month after travelling to Gent, 80 miles away from Genk, by mistake. Surely not. Anyway, this is the easy bit for Klopp. Hours after Liverpool confirmed they will play twice in two days next month – presumably Klopp will not be in both Birmingham and then Qatar for the Carabao Cup and Fifa Club World Cup respectively – it is back to the day job and a competition they truly cherish. Their Premier League showdown against Manchester City is not until Sunday but first they have the chance to brush aside Genk. Fabinho could return after skipping Saturday’s 2-1 win at Aston Villa, while Klopp could start James Milner and hand Jordan Henderson a breather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

Say hello to Worthing: the lesser-known beachside beauty with bucket-and-spades-full of family fun. Lola Davies, aged 13 (with a little help from mum Tracey), gives us the inside scoop on family time in her favourite seaside spot by Lola and Tracey DaviesI’m going to call this guide “The Importance of Being Worthing”, because my English teacher says that Oscar Wilde spent a summer here in 1894 – and wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in Worthing.Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing’s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

But does it help men find their dream mate - or just encourage street harassment?In an upmarket bar near Oxford Circus in London, I am watching two men hit on women with all the desperation of a doomed cavalry charge. But without the heroism.Mike and Raj (not their real names) circle the bar, scanning for women, drinks held at an awkward right angle to their chests. When they identify a target, they approach. The women stiffen, their smiles tightening. They swirl drinks with straws and chit-chat politely before mentioning boyfriends – real or imagined. The men retreat, regroup, identify fresh women. Advance, engage, retreat. On and on it goes.I’m standing with the man coordinating this operation, the British pickup artist Johnny Cassell, as he watches as Mike and Raj – his students – run drills. Tonight is the culmination of Cassell’s intensive, day-long “Impactful Connection” workshop. For £700, Cassell promises to help men “master the art of attracting the women you truly want”. But watching as Mike and Raj hit on women indiscriminately,  it looks as if any women will do.It has been a long and disturbing day. Arriving at the venue, a four-star Mayfair hotel that morning, I had found Cassell, 31, in a black mood: a client had just dropped out. Tall and handsome, with a wolfish air, Cassell switches between being charming and cold. He does not like being contradicted or mocked. At one point during the session, I joke about spreadsheets and GDPR violations. Cassell is visibly displeased.For the uninitiated, pickup artists (PUAs) are typically men – female artists are much rarer – who attempt to coax women into having sex with them through a mixture of flattery, psychological manipulation and coercion. The movement has a surprisingly long pedigree, dating back to Eric Weber’s now almost 50-year-old manual How to Pick Up Girls. Today, this seems relatively sedate stuff. Weber writes, “the most important tenet of a pick up is that it’s mutual … Women are entitled to say ‘no’, plain and simple.” But the community really exploded into the public consciousness with the publication of Neil Strauss’s 2005 international bestseller The Game, which sold 2.5m copies. It introduced a generation of men to the murky, underhand world of pickup artists and their nefarious tactics, such as negging – insulting a woman to undermine her confidence, and make her feel as if she has to seek your approval – or peacocking, where you dress flamboyantly as a talking point to hit on women. I went to university two years after The Game was published, and watched its influence spread like a virus through the men in my year: I don’t think I went on a night out in 2007 without some drunk rugby player trying to “neg” me.What was once an underground community has grown into a seduction industry valued at $100m (£75m). “The basic premise of all seduction teaching and practice is that interactions between men and women are subject to certain underlying principles that, once understood, can be readily manipulated,” explains Dr Rachel O’Neill of Warwick University, the author of Seduction: Men, Masculinity and Mediated Intimacy. “This is an impoverished view of sex and relationships, in which intimacy is less something to be experienced for its own sake and more something to be achieved for other ends.”Attending today’s workshop are Mike, a 31-year-old tech worker, and Raj, 26, who lives in Dubai and works in finance. We sit around a circular table in a panelled conference room. Oil paintings of horses stare down at us. “I’ve been doing this for 14 years,” Cassell says. “It started off as a need for myself. Now I teach other people.”Raj uses PUA terminology abundantly. “I have an issue with approach anxiety,” he says, meaning that he gets nervous hitting on women for the first time. He also refers to “sarging”, the process of picking up women. Both Raj and Mike are (perhaps unsurprisingly) edgy around me. I shunt my chair into a corner and arrange my features into a neutral expression.The workshop begins with Cassell urging Raj and Mike to pick their dream women. Raj favours Kylie Jenner Mike opts for Amber Gill, from Love Island. With the right mindset, Cassell says, they can bring their dream women into existence. He says reassuring if somewhat oblique things such as: “You are not a mass-market product,” and, “If you are getting rejected, you haven’t worked out what you want,” and, “The magic word here is, choose.” (Cassell writes “choose” on the whiteboard.)Pop psychology session over, Cassell teaches them a conversation model. When approaching a woman, they should begin by making an assumption, before using a hook to draw her into conversation. Next they should challenge her, then introduce a time constraint and close the interaction by asking for a phone number. Raj and Mike hunch over their notebooks like dutiful schoolboys.In recent years, Cassell has been describing himself as a dating coach as well as a pickup artist, and avoids the worst excesses of the PUA community, such as sexually coercive tactics. Notorious pickup artist Daryush Valizadeh – known as Roosh V – was accused of advocating legalising rape, on private property, in comments he later said were satirical. The American pickup artist Julien Blanc was banned from entering the UK in 2014, after 157,000 people signed a petition protesting against his visit. Earlier this month, pickup artist Adnan Ahmed – who called himself “Addy A-Game” – was jailed for two years after being convicted of threatening and abusive behaviour. Ahmed would harass women on the streets of Glasgow, causing them distress, and offered tips on his YouTube channel on how to overcome “last-minute resistance to sex”.While his patter is assured, Cassell’s teaching feels to me very similar to the message of Neil Strauss’s seminal pickup bible. At one point, Cassell suggests challenging a woman who is into Crossfit by telling her that Crossfit is for people who aren’t really good at any sport. This appears to be textbook negging.Conversational model learned, it’s now time for what Cassell refers to as fieldwork, but would more accurately be termed street harassment. Thus follow two of the most dispiriting hours of my career, as I walk around central London in the rain, watching as Raj and Mike pester women. They pretend to ask for directions, and after the woman has pointed out the route, say: “Actually I just wanted to talk to you,” or, “You look cute.”At one point, Mike stops two women on Oxford Street and pretends to ask for directions. After they walk on, Cassell sends Mike chasing after them – he is convinced one was being flirtatious, because she crossed her legs while speaking to Mike. (She tells him she has a boyfriend.) Outside Fortnum \u0026amp Mason on Piccadilly, there is a surreal chat about whether the men should approach a young woman shopping with her mother. Cassell decides in favour of it, but by then, thankfully, the women have moved on.As a young woman who has experienced street harassment throughout my life, it is an extraordinarily uncomfortable thing to observe. I know that, on a fundamental level, women do not want to be approached in this way by strangers on the street. Not when they are running errands, or chatting on the phone, or on their way home from work. We want men to leave us alone.But I am here to observe. So I say nothing and we squelch on through the rain. I am struck by the fact that all the women being approached are uniformly young, slim, white – and uniformly polite. They smile and refer to boyfriends, but with the exception of one woman Mike interrupts having a cigarette outside Pret – who looks furious – they do not seem put out. Why don’t any of these women tell Mike and Raj to get lost?“Women are socialised not to challenge men,” explains Dr Bianca Fileborn of the University of Melbourne, an expert in gendered street harassment. “But this response may also be about managing the situation safely.” When you confront a stranger you risk escalating the situation. “You don’t know what’s going to happen next. These are men who’ve already crossed your boundaries … deflecting them, by telling them you have a boyfriend – in effect, saying, ‘I’m the property of another man, please leave me alone’ – can be a strategy for managing the situation.”As we walk, Mike is having an internal tussle. “You do wonder, am I bothering people?” he admits. “Especially with things like #MeToo. But then I think, you’re being nice. You’ve gone up to someone and said they’re attractive.” This message – that the men are doing a good thing, and that women enjoy being hit on in the street – is continually reinforced by Cassell. He urges them on, an officer rallying his troops. “I want you to take that shot. You’re just making someone feel better about themselves.”After Raj is rejected outside Topshop (who knew so many women in central London had boyfriends?), Cassell reassures him he has done nothing wrong. “She’s going to call her friend and say: ‘Oh my God, this guy just hit on me!’ You made her day.” Outside Piccadilly Circus tube station, the cold rain whipping my face, Cassell repeats: “You’re just making someone feel better about themselves. It would be selfish not to.”That’s not true. I think I am witnessing street harassment – something Fileborn makes emphatically clear. “This behaviour has a profoundly negative impact on women. It’s often excused as flirting, or seen as good-natured. And on the inidual incident level, I can understand why you might think that: someone came and spoke to you in the street, what’s the big deal? But for many women, these aren’t one-off experiences, but are repeated constantly, often from childhood. They add up.” She sighs. “I don’t think men live with this experience of being intruded upon and having people feel entitled to your time.”On we walk. I think about the smartly dressed man who said something crude as I was having lunch at a former job. I told him not to talk to me like that. His fury was sudden and total. “Fuck you,” he snarled, as I recoiled in terror. I always remember how quickly the rage came, like it had been there all along. Eventually, we head back to the hotel. As the men write down their aspirations for the future, Cassell, surreally, puts on the score to Inception.We decamp to the hotel restaurant and eat while making stilted conversation. It is not an easy meal for anyone. The men feel that I am judging them. Mike says he thinks men should be physically stronger, so they can protect women, and waits for a response. I chew my food. Cassell tells me about a girlfriend who would prefer to pay a handyman rather than ask him for help. He didn’t like that, he says. It made him feel redundant. “What do you think about that?” Cassell says, fixing me with a cold look. I make a feeble joke.And so, to the bar where the staff know Cassell and don’t seem to mind that he is bringing men into the venue expressly to pester women. For the next three hours, Cassell identifies groups of women. The men trot over obediently. “Try that blonde at the bar,” he tells Raj. “You’d only be adding to her night. She looks bored.” Cassell suggests going up to a woman, saying “Trick or Treat?”, and then holding her wrist. At one point, Cassell sends Mike to sit with two women who are having a quiet drink. “What should I say?” Mike pleads. He is vibrating with nerves.In that moment, I feel sorry for Mike. It is easy to judge these men, but they are painfully introverted and shy – even childlike in the way they look to Cassell for answers. I don’t think they are bad people. But they are denying women the chance to exist in public spaces without being treated as objects of desire. Just to be free, without an imaginary boyfriend or a place you need to be.The night wears on. “I’m not sleazy,” Cassell says, apropos of nothing. My feet hurt and my chest feels tight with emotion. I say goodnight. Raj and Mike look relieved I’m leaving. On and on they circle, men on the prowl."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b36751615c8bc3b22ca0fdd3ae64e71f6e821389/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e628a1913427d59623335872d3827f2","title":"the attachment secret are you a secure avoidant or anxious partner","story":"It’s difficult to find lasting love, but by recognising your attachment type you can be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotagingIt was the breakup that changed Amir Levine’s life. Fifteen years ago, he told his partner that he was falling in love with him and wanted them to move forward as a couple. His partner fled, moving across the country. The end of the relationship was especially painful for Levine. At the time he was a student at Columbia University in New York, where he is now assistant professor of clinical psychiatry. He was working in a therapeutic nursery programme, helping mothers with post-traumatic stress bond with their children. Through it, he became fascinated by the science of adult attachment.In the 1950s, the influential British psychologist and psychiatrist John Bowlby observed the lifelong impact of the earliest bonds formed in life, between children and parents, or primary caregivers: attachment theory, which has been widely researched and drawn upon since then. There are three major styles of attachment: secure, anxious and avoidant.When Levine came across attachment theory as a student, no one seemed to have applied it to adult romantic relationships but he immediately saw the relevance to his own heartbreak. His boyfriend had an avoidant attachment style.It was a revelation to Levine now he knew why their relationship hadn’t worked. “It didn’t make it less painful, but I could understand it better. I was surprised that no one had taken those concepts and translated them into something that people could use.”For 15 years, he has been doing just that, at Columbia, in private practice, and as an author. With his friend and fellow psychologist Rachel Heller, Levine wrote Attached, a practical guide to harnessing adult attachment theory to find lasting love, described by its authors as “the manual we wish we’d had when we were dating”. The idea is that by recognising your type you can identify a suitable partner, be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotaging.“It’s not you, it’s my attachment style,” may sound like a gift for commitment-phobes, but the response to Attached suggests it has really helped people, says Levine. First published in 2010, the book has been updated to include stories from readers who found it “a profound relief to discover that their needs for closeness are valid”.There is an assumption that everyone has the “capacity to love in the same way”, says Levine, but our attachment styles act like programming: “It goes much deeper than communication – it affects our perception of the world, without us really knowing it.”Anxiously attached people tend to be overly preoccupied with their partners and whether they love them back, while avoidants equate intimacy with a loss of independence and deploy distancing strategies. (You can find out your type by doing the quiz at AttachedTheBook – if it is not immediately obvious.)Learning about which style they are can change people’s lives, says Levine: “They are stopped from doing the same thing that hasn’t worked for them.”You are not necessarily stuck with your style: according to a four-year study, one in four people do change over time – often as a result of a relationship with someone who has a secure attachment style.Anxious and avoidant types are drawn to each other, despite their incompatible styles: as the person seeking closeness works harder to get it, their avoidant partner pulls away, thus reaffirming their separate beliefs that relationships are unfulfilling or restrictive. Levine’s pop culture example is the film 500 Days of Summer, with Zooey Deschanel’s Manic Pixie Dream Girl character a textbook avoidant.People in anxious-avoidant relationships can change their behaviour with introspection and, often, therapy. Cate Mackenzie, a London-based psychosexual therapist, cites American couples therapist Hedy Schleifer’s turtle-and-octopus theory, in which one is inclined to retreat, the other to reach out. Mackenzie says anxious octopuses can be overly critical of avoidant turtles, who may have internalised shame about avoidance. Her aim is to soften their exchange, by encouraging both partners to open up and better understand each other, “to build a new paradigm”.But, she adds: “Even if one person was more of a turtle in another relationship, it can change – the person with the higher desire becomes the octopus.” Dr Rob Weisskirch, professor of human development at California State University, says attachment theory is a useful tool for understanding nuance in relationships, but it’s also possible to overestimate its importance. It doesn’t necessarily mean you are destined to have bad relationships.“There are plenty of external experiences that can be additive for healthy relationships,” he says. In other words, nothing is set in stone.Attached is mostly geared towards helping people who are still floundering in the dating pool – particularly anxious types, who are more vulnerable. Avoidants are relatively glossed over, Levine admits. “We never thought they were going to read this,” he says. Nevertheless, this avoidant found it an illuminating read.Levine’s dating advice is to be upfront about your needs as predetermined by your type, and to try to identify your potential partner’s type. For example, if you recognise that your anxious attachment style means it is important to you that your partner texts back quickly, make it clear early on. How they respond to a relatively low-stakes request will give you a clue to their own triggers.People tend to go with the flow and find out over time, but that initial stage is crucial, says Levine. “When it’s left up to chance, you’re lucky if you find someone who is nourishing and helpful – if you’re unlucky, you don’t. It’s important to be able to ask for what you need.”The “spark” that guides many people’s decisions doesn’t necessarily indicate long-term compatibility, he says. “And once you start to like the person, and make them special and unique to you, it’s hard to undo it.”The premium placed on a securely attached partner can create its own pressures. Avoidants often distract from promising romantic prospects by fantasising about “the one”, while Mackenzie warns that “high-achieving octopuses”, in particular, can become overly preoccupied with a checklist of traits.Levine is sympathetic to anyone who is struggling to find a partner. “When we are in a relationship we tend to forget how hard it is to be alone, to hope to find someone, to go out on yet another date. Even if you’re the one who is rejecting, dating is a very stressful time.”He and Heller make it clear that our choice of partner powerfully affects our ability to thrive in the world – and that being clear-eyed about your needs in a relationship, and what would make you happy, is the first step towards success.Attached: How the Science of Adult Attachment Can Help You Find – and Keep – Love, by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, is published by Bluebird, £9.99.

If you’d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can catch our latest Brexit Means … podcast here, and for daily updates head to Andrew Sparrow’s politics live blog.After reluctantly accepting the EU’s offer of a 31 January Brexit extension and falling short of a two-thirds majority for an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, Boris Johnson abandoned all attempts to get his Brexit deal through the Commons.Instead, the prime minister tabled a short bill to change the law in order to hold a poll on 12 December – a move that would require only a simple majority and so could be passed with the backing of the Liberal Democrats or the Scottish National party.In the event, both abstained after their preferred date of 9 December was rejected – but the Labour party, declaring the opportunity a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”, backed it and it sailed through by 438 votes to 20.At the fourth time of asking – and rather than granting MPs more time to scrutinise an agreement that they had passed with a majority of 30 at second reading – Johnson had the election he wanted, Britain’s first December poll since 1923.The prime minister warned his forces it was going to be a hard campaign, however, and got an early reminder of just how hard when Nigel Farage gave him a two-week deadline to drop his Brexit deal or face a Brexit party candidate in every seat.With Farage’s party plainly set to challenge the Conservatives for every leave vote it can, Johnson felt the need to apologise to Tory members for not taking Britain out of the EU on 31 October – as he had promised to do “come what may”.He also is unlikely to have welcomed the public interventions in the UK campaign of Donald Trump, who has twice said he hopes the prime minister, a “wonderful guy”, and Farage should come together on a united political platform.Labour, which is promising to negotiate a new deal with Brussels within three months if it wins and put it to a referendum in six, is determined for once to show unity: “The debate on Brexit is over,” Jeremy Corbyn told his fractious shadow cabinet.Polls, meanwhile, put the Conservatives well ahead (although they did so, too, of course, in 2017). But tactical voting could be a game-changer, with the People’s Vote campaign preparing to start spending a £1m war chest despite a continuing conflict within the organisation.Most serious analysts and commentators warn strenuously that voter volatility, the revival of the anti-Brexit Lib Dems, the emergence of the pro-no-deal Brexit party and – as ever – the unpredictable effects of Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system mean this will be an election of quite exceptional complexity.It would take a fool, therefore, to predict the result. But it is worth bearing in mind that victory for Johnson can only be an absolute majority in the Commons, since there is no reliable alliance he can build for his deal. Victory for the rest could mean simply getting enough seats between them to deny him that majority.Looking further forward, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator who has just been appointed to lead the bloc’s taskforce on future relations with the UK, issued a timely reminder that ratification of the exit deal was only the start of Brexit.That future relationship still has to be hammered out – in 11 months unless the transition period is extended, which experts consider inevitable – and Barnier warned British companies could expect barriers to trade with the EU if the government seeks to abandon EU social, environmental and consumer standards.His new watchword: the EU will be happy with an agreement that features “zero tariffs, zero quotas … and zero dumping”.’s editorial said the election would be all about Brexit, whose future now rests on the result of the general election in six weeks’ time:A political scientist explains why it would be foolish for anyone to predict the election outcome:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eaffc772b4fe904663767f61f7768cc155a793a/0_87_2021_1213/master/2021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb1ada4c35fb2bf9865a9a43889591e5","title":"have you received any general election leaflets share your photos","story":"With campaigning officially underway, we would like to see what kind of claims your local candidates are makingAs the main parties ramp up their election campaigns, letterboxes across the country will begin to clog with leaflets vying to attract voters’ attention.We want to hear the most outlandish claims your local candidates from the main political parties or independents have made to try to win your vote.If you’ve spotted claims you think should be challenged, unverified bar charts, or facts you think need checking: send them over to us.If you’ve received an eyebrow-raising leaflet, letter or other printed material from a political party or candidate ahead of December’s general election, send us a photo.To share it with us, fill out the encrypted form below.

I have to say - that is reckless.”Another rebel who has left the Tories, the former education secretary Justine Greening, said on Tuesday she would find it difficult to vote for the party under Johnson.“I certainly don’t want to see us getting on with what I think would be a very damaging deal for Britain. So it would be very hard for me to vote for the Conservatives, if I’m looking at what they stand for on Brexit,” she told Radio 5 Live.Anne Milton, another of the 21 MPs, announced on Tuesday that she would stand as an independent candidate in her Surrey seat of Guildford, where she has a 17,000 majority.“I wrote to the PM yesterday to tell him I felt unable to be a Conservative candidate,” she said.Several of the still-whipless MPs say they do not plan to stand again in the election, including Ken Clarke, who will step down after just short of 50 years in the Commons, and Rory Stewart, who has launched a bid to become mayor of London as an independent.In a separate development, the Conservatives have come under fire for misleadingly editing a video of Labour’s Keir Starmer, to make him appear unable to answer a question on Brexit.﻿On Wednesday, Johnson is expected to head to Buckingham Palace for an audience with the Queen before returning to parliament to announce the formal start of the general election.Later, he will appear at the Conservatives’ first official election rally at which he will repeat his slogan that the party must “get Brexit done” by changing “this blockading parliament”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b4473fd43a9022964a7a2455fece8fa6ed941f/0_0_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566ec81d7f987850e0c6695957458c68","title":"voyager 2 story of mission so far in pictures","story":"Since launching in 1977, the Nasa probe has captured never-before-seen images of the solar system"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d010df81c370f4372f5ba16d2572e66521c6302/0_41_3429_2058/master/3429.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e9e44ca6a3aa3273578a6895e371c6a8 2280w","title":"ticket sales revamped davis cup tennis tournament struggling","story":"Davis Cup organisers admit selling tickets for the revamped competition is proving a challenge with less than two weeks to go.Eighteen national teams will head to Madrid for the first edition of the week-long, World Cup-style event, which begins on 18 November. The new format, which has largely replaced the traditional home-and-away fixtures, was controversially approved at last year’s International Tennis Federation AGM despite vociferous opposition from a number of current and former players, officials and fans.The Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique’s Kosmos company is the financial muscle behind the event having pledged to invest £2.3bn over 25 years, but efforts to recoup some of that money through strong ticket sales are proving problematic.A spokeswoman for Kosmos said: “We are happy with ticket sales for the afternoon sessions and from Friday until Sunday (quarter-finals, semi-finals and final) but it’s much more difficult to sell tickets for morning sessions, as happens in all tournaments.”The disappointing sales come despite countries naming strong teams, which was the main objective of the change of format. Six of the men’s world top 10 will be in Madrid, including Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, with Germany’s Alexander Zverev the only eligible player to opt against making the trip.There are also six players ranked between 10 and 20 and eight between 21 and 30, while Great Britain’s team includes the former world No 1 Andy Murray.Meanwhile, Djokovic and Roger Federer have been drawn in the same group for the ATP Finals in London. The pair will do battle in the Bjorn Borg group at the O2 Arena and are joined by the French Open finalist Dominic Thiem and Italian debutant Matteo Berrettini.• Matches take place at the O2 in London (10-17 Nov)The top seed, Nadal, avoided Federer but finds himself alongside US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and defending champion Zverev at the season-ending tournament, which begins on Sunday.Doubts remain about Nadal’s fitness but he is hopeful of being able to compete. The Spaniard suffered an abdominal injury at the Paris Masters last week and had to pull out prior to his scheduled semi-final against Denis Shapovalov, prompting concerns he may again miss the ATP Finals.Writing on Twitter, Nadal said: “Despite having a small strain, I will travel to London. Thursday or Friday I will start serving. The idea is to be able to play the ATP Finals in London.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dc3c158998049baae806053d44fd625230ffee/243_114_1346_808/master/1346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ec1be536183123d0810500f645f775","title":"facebook rebrands as facebook can capital letters save a toxic brand","story":"The company’s new logo is designed to bring a ‘sense of optimism’ to the brand that brought us the Cambridge Analytica scandalAmid antitrust investigations, Capitol Hill hearings, and a generally poor reputation, the company announced on Monday it is rebranding itself. In the coming weeks, a new multicolored, all-caps logo will begin appearing across its services. Instagram and Whatsapp, owned by the company, will proudly tell users that they are services “from FACEBOOK”.Facebook is the social network you hate FACEBOOK is the company you didn’t know you loved.But why FACEBOOK? The upper-case logo proves the company’s worthiness. It’s designed with “clarity and openness” in mind, a blogpost explains, with “harmonized capital letters”. All checks out: after all, what is FACEBOOK if not a place of openness and harmony?And that’s not all. FACEBOOK uses “dynamic” colors, with the logo “taking on the color of its environment”. The company calls this “an empathetic color palette”, which makes sense. Blue is just mean, but bright green understands me. On top of that, “the subtle softening of corners and diagonals adds a sense of optimism”. Who could look at the new FACEBOOK and not feel renewed hope coursing through their veins?The rebrand has prompted general eye-rolling – the AV Club’s Allison Shoemaker points out that even peppering the logo with unicorns would not save the company’s image. But that won’t stop marketing teams from trying.Just last month, Yahoo went the opposite direction, opting for a lowercase yahoo! in an effort, as Chaim Gartenberg noted at the Verge, to remind people of its existence. Given the need for attention, you’d think think the company might have stuck with the capital letters. But it did, according to design notes, opt for the font Centra No 2 Extrabold – which, of course, screams “I’m relevant!”Another fallen internet giant, AOL, did the same a decade earlier. It shifted to Aol., with the full stop, presumably to suggest that its life was coming to a close. This came at a time when, with the economy in the tank, the guidance in the New York Times was that “bold, block capital letters are out”, in favor of a softer, friendlier lowercase approach. Perhaps it’s a sign of a strong economy, then, that FACEBOOK has turned on caps lock.Meanwhile, unlike media companies such as VICE and POLITICO, FACEBOOK does not appear to be using all caps in its copy – just in images. This is good news for copy editors who would prefer not to help companies rebrand. It’s especially good news for the ’s copy desk, which puts a premium on lowercase – unlike FACEBOOK, we’re not yelling at you.Still, you might wonder whether pasting the new logo on other services is a smart move: why tarnish Instagram and Whatsapp with an enlarged logo of the evil empire? (The services had already been rebranded with a lowercase acknowledgment of their parent company.) Won’t it backfire to remind people that their trusty, end-to-end- encrypted WhatsApp descends from the company that brought us the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Won’t Instagram’s hipness be damaged by a reminder that its boss is King Zuck, Lord of the Nerds?In other words, the company is distancing itself from the hated service it actually created by propping itself up on the beloved social networks it bought. So when foreign powers interfere with the 2020 election, Mark Zuckerberg can tell Congress: sure, Facebook has its problems. But FACEBOOK is doing just fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a41b8e567940356eac6eb5623657e8d895a418/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=366302880961dc1e6308c0d586a52c38","title":"teens are making historical events go viral on tiktok what does a history teacher think","story":"‘I’d use them in class,’ says Izzy Jones, a London-based vice-principal, while marveling at their range and ingenuity There is a long-held stereotype that teenagers spend a lot of time online, uninterested in real life events.People who say that clearly haven’t seen them on TikTok, where they are engaging in the unexpected: teaching history lessons.Nadia Jaferey, a former staffer for Kirsten Gillibrand, drew attention to the phenomenon in October, when she tweeted out a thread of her favorite TikTok history re-enactments. She linked to several short videos where teenagers played out key points in history, with special effects and audio to boot.I asked a history expert to watch the videos and comment: my old history teacher, Izzy Jones, who is now vice-principal at my old high school in London.She is delighted to see teenagers use the platform this way. “The ones that I really liked were the ones on the international relations in the 20th century,” says Jones, adding: “I’d use some of those videos in class.”She explains how the most powerful videos use human beings to personify world actors – such as countries – in major historical events.In one video, a TikTok user called @Dontkickphilip personifies the German empire in 1914, aggressively telling Belgium: “I didn’t push you, I moved you out of the way because you wouldn’t move when I asked you to move three times. So I walked through you.” It sums up the military invasion of Belgium by Germany, after Belgium refused Germany passage through the country.In another, a user called @frontierland re-enacts the European expansion into the Americas through a video showing her as a native woman, plaiting her hair and minding her own business. Then all of a sudden, thousands of European settlers are muscling their way in, to the lyrics: “Walking through your neighborhood, spreading all my fleas.”Jones explains that the personification of countries in historical events is helpful in understanding intention and gives a boring textbook subject some personality.Crucially, these videos are providing an interpretation of the past. Both are making an implicit comment on the behavior of those actors.The teens “have used technology really effectively but they’ve also used it appropriately … Sometimes, someone will write an essay which is really lyrical and uses really complex grammar and high-level vocabulary but actually they are talking nonsense. This is not that,” says Jones.The videos are, of course, incomplete – it would be hard to expect more from a 15-second clip. Take a clip by @slaviccaesar, who sums up the American role in the creation of the League of Nations and its retreat from the organization. In the video, she dances towards the camera and then backs away when France and Britain expect the US to join the League.America didn’t just suddenly make a U-turn out of the League of Nations: Woodrow Wilson met with congressional resistance and his successor, Warren Harding, opposed the organization. But as long as we understand that the videos are just a snapshot of a moment in time, they are effective.“A 15-second video is probably most effective in getting across one key point. Of course it’s not the whole story – but I thought that was a pretty good summation of what happened in 1929 and 1920,” says Jones.She says that the videos are largely historically accurate, but even if they weren’t, they work as a useful historical tool.To make this point, she takes a video about the plague. In it, @youalreadyknowbb portrays the plague as a plot between rats and the plague to kill half of Europe and become superstars in history.If interpreted literally, it doesn’t explain the whole story: if rats were the only reason for the plague, London would be full of plague victims right now. Lack of hospitals and bad hygiene practices were also likely contributors to its spread.But if you taught students about the different factors that contributed to the plague, showed them the video, and then got them to critique it, you would be helping them to understand one of the most important skills in history: how to understand the limitations of any account of a historical event.“Everything you interact with that’s written after an event – whether it’s five minutes after or 500 years after the event – is an interpretation of the past. This is a great way to help people appreciate that,” says Jones.She says that if the students were in her history class, they would be getting an A+ for their history TikToks.Asked how she’d feel if she found out this is what her students were getting up to while her head was turned, she says: “I would be absolutely ecstatic. There are few things that would excite me more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ae28aeedac919414655996726c1d012b54a64f/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f925c056a72651eef6babdc510430714","title":"tips vintage shopping europe uk win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Into 50s clothing , 80 mags or 70s soul on vinyl?

They talk disturbing cover-ups and their decades-long fight against sexual harassment“What a wonderful sweater!” gasps Reese Witherspoon, pointing at my old green jumper.“Wait, I’m sorry, look at those cool shoes,” adds Jennifer Aniston, with a comedy emphasis that verges on Chandler Bing-esque, and all eyes turn to my muddy, five-year-old trainers.“And the bag, oh my gosh,” Witherspoon continues appraising my outfit.Neither of them mentions my trousers, so I make a mental note to burn them when I get home.The three of us are meeting in a central London hotel and although outside it is dark and rainy, the two of them, in little black dresses and black high heels, are as golden and glossy as a pair of show ponies on a summer’s day. I, on the other hand, have rain-soaked hair and at least one surplus stone in post-partum weight. But Aniston and Witherspoon will not be swayed from their lovebombing (“I love the !” – Witherspoon).It is a supremely girly way of easing into an interview, engaging in the female lingua franca of insistently complimenting another woman. If it weren’t for the fact there are three PRs in the room with us – one next to Aniston, two next to Witherspoon – I could almost believe that we were just three gals, hanging out for giggles on a Friday afternoon.The actual reason we are hanging out today is to discuss Aniston and Witherspoon’s extremely shiny new television series, The Morning Show, in which they both star, and produce – it’s very much the showpiece of the new streaming service, Apple TV+. It is the first time the women have worked together since playing sisters on Friends, and, as all the press releases excitedly emphasise, it is the first TV show Aniston has committed to since the sitcom that made her a star. The two women have stayed friends since playing Rachel and Jill Greene – “Jen throws an amazing Christmas party!” “I do love entertaining!” “And you’re so good at it, you need to teach me!” – and stress keenly that they are hands on “from top to bottom, from script, to casting, to the tone” of The Morning Show.“It’s a great partnership because I’m a morning person and she’s a night person,” says Witherspoon.“We literally share the responsibility together, and there’s something so refreshing about that,” finishes Witherspoon.Watching and listening to them talk gives a sense of their working dynamic. Witherspoon takes the conversational lead, Aniston gamely backs her up, Witherspoon makes the concluding statement. Bish bash done.Both women are experienced producers with their own production companies. I’ve met many male producers and Aniston and Witherspoon definitely have a less macho, more personable energy than, say, Jerry Bruckheimer, and let’s not even mention the Weinstein brothers (at least, not yet).Why it’s necessary for these power structures to change, and how that started to happen, is precisely what The Morning Show is about. The series was originally envisioned as a TV drama about breakfast TV, but just as they were starting to work on it in 2017, Matt Lauer, the much-loved presenter of NBC’s hugely popular breakfast programme, Today, was accused of sexual misconduct. Instead of dumping their planned programme, Aniston and Witherspoon helped to rejig the story. It now opens with the male newscaster, Mitch (Steve Carell), being accused of sexual harassment, to the horror of his long-term co-host, Alex (Aniston). “So now, instead of dancing around that subject, we were like, OK, episode one – there it is,” says Witherspoon, who plays Bradley, the newscaster brought in to replace Mitch.For two decades, Lauer was one of the biggest television stars in the US. Imagine Phillip Schofield combined with Gary Lineker and Ant and Dec and you have some sense of Lauer’s ubiquity and seemingly clean-cut appeal. Although Carell isn’t explicitly playing Lauer on The Morning Show, he absolutely nails his onscreen all-American-dad charm and the creepy darkness beneath it.The allegations against Lauer were shocking from the start – it was said that he had a button on his desk that enabled him to lock his office door as soon as a woman entered the room – and they have only become more gothic.He has been accused of anal rape and, in his new book, Catch and Kill, the former NBC journalist Ronan Farrow says not only did network management know about Lauer’s behaviour, but they killed Farrow’s investigations into Harvey Weinstein out of fear that the movie producer would retaliate by exposing the truth about Lauer. NBC and Lauer – and Weinstein – deny all allegations against them. When I ask if they have read Farrow’s book, Aniston points to Witherspoon and says, “She has,” in a “she’s the reader” tone of voice.Lauer was not the only US breakfast TV host to be accused of sexual misconduct in 2017: CBS’s Charlie Rose also stepped down after multiple women accused him of harassment. (Rose apologised for his “inappropriate behaviour” but said he did not believe all the allegations made against him were accurate.)Aniston and Witherspoon spoke to Rose’s former colleague Gayle King about what the revelations felt like for her, given they sat next to each other for years.“He was a friend. And they were on air for so long and you didn’t know this about your colleague’s personality,” says Witherspoon.The show isn’t perfect. Aniston is great as the brittle TV anchor seemingly on the verge of losing her mind. But the plot is clunky and the characters’ motivations are so baffling that even they seem confused by them: “Why are you doing this?” “I don’t know!” they shout at one another.Given that the series is ostensibly about the #MeToo movement, its stakes are bewilderingly low: the show’s main concern is whether a wealthy female presenter’s career will suffer because of her male colleague’s behaviour. Is that really the worst thing those involved can imagine happening to a woman – losing a highly paid job?Yet the show deserves credit for touching on some of the ambiguities within the #MeToo movement, such as whether a man sleazing on younger subordinates should be discussed in the same breath as an accused rapist, and how we unpick the complexities of consent when a sexual experience can be interpreted totally differently by the involved parties.“There’s this absolute denial – ‘It was consensual, it was consensual’ – if you’re a narcissist to the degree a lot of these guys are. They think, of course every woman wants to sleep with me,” says Aniston.“This is not an echo chamber of women talking about #MeToo,” says Witherspoon. “It’s actually a very gender-balanced conversation because we need men watching the show. Real change doesn’t happen unless the incumbent power structure accepts it.”That seems a somewhat debatable point – has the patriarchy ever really accepted feminism? – but I want to talk to Witherspoon about her character in particular. One of the key moments in the series is when she realises that almost everyone knew about Mitch and she sets out to expose this culture of corporate silence.In 2017, Witherspoon revealed that she had been sexually assaulted by a director when she was 16, and was instructed by agents and producers to keep quiet about it. “I wish I could tell you that was an isolated incident in my career but, sadly, it wasn’t. I’ve had multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault,” she said.She felt, she added, “guilt for not speaking up earlier”.How does she think her experiences affected her personally?“It makes me determined not to let this happen to other young women. I’m so grateful to the women who spoke out about things in their past because I’m in a different position, obviously, but those women had nothing to gain, and some lost their jobs over it. They are the real heroes in my mind.”So does she wish she could have spoken out sooner?The temperature in the room drops palpably.“Ummm no. It was a culture of silence and silence was a condition of my employment. That’s what I was told,” she says.I wouldn’t normally press a woman about her experiences of sexual harassment and assault. But given that for the past 20 minutes we have been talking about the importance of talking about sexual assault allegations and cover-ups, and the courage of women who speak up, I am surprised that Witherspoon is shutting down any discussion of her experiences with aphorisms about art.Perhaps I’m asking the wrong questions. I try again: are the people who harassed her or told her to stay silent still working in the entertainment industry?“Ummmmm no,” Witherspoon eventually says. She shoots a frowny-smiley face towards her PRs.“I think we’ll move on now, OK?” one of them says firmly to me.Aniston is looking at me dazed, as if shocked that I’ve broken some code. I feel a little as if I am about to be ejected from the cool girls’ table.But it’s fine. We’re all professionals, so we move on to Harvey Weinstein, a less controversial subject, given that everyone agrees he is Bad. He distributed Witherspoon’s 2002 film The Importance of Being Earnest and produced Aniston’s 2005 film Derailed.“I was never alone in a room with him,” says Aniston.“I was never alone with him either. But I didn’t know why,” adds Witherspoon.“Me neither. But always someone would stand in the room,” Aniston echoes.“Now I look back and I’m very grateful to those people who stayed in the room with me. What they knew, I don’t know,” says Witherspoon.Witherspoon, 43, and Aniston, 50, have been hugely famous for more than half their lives, with the former shooting to fame in the 90s teen film Cruel Intentions when she was 23, and the latter becoming a TV icon at 25 in Friends.Probably the most fun part of The Morning Show is watching Aniston show, through her character, how being in the spotlight can drive a woman to near breaking point. “There is something very interesting about being a public person and playing a public person and incorporating those challenges and bringing them out into the open,” she agrees.Few modern celebrities have been more in the white-hot light of public fascination than Aniston. Ever since the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt in 2005, she has been treated by the media and public as more of a soap opera character than an actual person, one whose life (will she have children? Will she marry again?) we can all follow breathlessly. When she joined Instagram last month, posting a photo of herself and her Friends co-stars, she caused the site to crash. Is she comfortable with the amount of exposure she has?“I find it very odd,” she says, leaning forward earnestly. “I don’t understand it – it doesn’t make sense to me. I’d love for someone to break it down, but there it is and now it has to keep going.”Does it control her life?“No! No, no, no,” she scoffs.She admits she joined Instagram mainly to promote the show.“But also, I think I had this idea … I don’t want to be the only person … Let’s see, what do I want to say here?” she says, with the wariness of one accustomed to having their most casual comments blown up into headlines. “I thought, ‘Why would I do this? People are already in my panty drawers all the time.’“And I want them out of my panty drawers. But now I can decide which pair to show them.”“That’s the best thing you ever said!” hoots Witherspoon.On that note, our time is up.“Thank you for your thoughtful questions,” says Witherspoon, as if thanking me for a kidney.And I leave them fighting for the #MeToo movement, within their limits.The Morning Show is on Apple TV+."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840d4a9cd327e30c48b228050e30df4aee2ad2a3/488_245_2980_1789/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d7886508bd83a3a3080083e7a9c613","title":"david attenborough the making of a british icon","story":"Patrick Barkham joins Anushka Asthana to chart the rise of one of Britain’s best-loved personalities: the natural history broadcaster David Attenborough.

However, Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran’s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, later said Iran had informed the IAEA over “the start of injecting UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) into centrifuges at Fordow”.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.In the nuclear deal, which has been unravelling since Donald Trump pulled the US out last year, Iran agreed to refashion its Fordow plant as a centre for the production of stable isotopes, which have applications in industry, agriculture and medicine.Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes, but the move will add to existing US Congress pressure to remove US waivers for research at the Fordow site.The US has always seen Fordow as a covert and highly fortified facility intended for the production of enough uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year.Iran, confirming a plan first announced in September, also said on Monday it was going ahead with a tenfold increase in its enriched uranium production at its Natanz facility.Rouhani said the steps taken so far – including going beyond the deal’s enrichment and stockpile limitations – could be reversed if Europe offered a way to avoid US sanctions choking off its crude oil sales abroad.“All of the steps Iran has taken to reduce its commitments to the nuclear deal are reversible and Iran will uphold all of its commitments under the deal when the remaining signatories – France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China – do the same.” He said the United Nations nuclear agency would still be allowed to inspect Iran’s activities, including work at Fordow.Rouhani added: “We know their sensitivity with regards to Fordow. With regard to these centrifuges, we know. But at the same time when they uphold their commitments we will cut off the gas again ... So it is possible to reverse this step.”He said Iran would continue to negotiate with European powers behind the scenes to reach an agreement on how Europe could build trade with Iran and circumvent US secondary sanctions. “We can’t unilaterally accept that we completely fulfil our commitments and they don’t follow up on their commitments,” he said.In an attempt to further calm European reaction, Rouhani’s chief of staff told the Iranian Mehr news agency that the nuclear deal was still in place and that “there’s a long way before our complete withdrawal”.Centrifuges are machines that spin at supersonic speeds to separate atomic elements. They can be used to enrich uranium as well as other elements, such as xenon and iridium, for medical and industrial purposes.Feeding uranium gas into spinning centrifuges allows for the separation of a highly radioactive form of uranium, U-235, which can be split to produce power in nuclear reactors.Ilan Goldenberg, Middle east security director at Centre for a New American Security, said: “Rouhani’s announcement that Iran will start spinning 1,000 centrifuges at Fordow is by far the most significant step Iran has taken outside the JCPOA, and another sign that Trump’s maximum pressure campaign is failing.”Iran has gradually shelved its commitments made under the deal with world powers in response to the US maximum economic sanctions programme imposed last year. That programme has blocked Iran’s oil exports, damaged its currency and interfered with the flow of medicines.Reactions to the Iranian decision from JCPOA signatories were initially hostile. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was concerned by Iran’s intention to further scale back its commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal, and that Moscow would like the deal to remain in place. The French government said the announcement was a breach of the JCPOA, but would await the formal report from the International Atomic Energy Authority on the decision’s implications. JCPOA’s collapse coincided with a tense summer of attacks on oil tankers and Saudi oil facilities that the US blamed on Iran. Tehran denied the allegation, though it did seize oil tankers and shoot down a US military surveillance drone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee150dce748cf7dfe7da27122e7884a2e5439856/0_179_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a370e89c54d3f9a16135f4067123415","title":"she had one sweet left woman survives three days lost in aegean greece","story":"Officer Giorgios Marietakis describes sailor Kushila Stein’s rescue after she lost an oarOn a rescue mission, Capt Giorgos Marietakis only ever has one rule: to tune into his senses and envision the person he is out to save. On Sunday, he put himself into what he imagined would be the mindset of Kushila Stein, a 45-year-old New Zealand woman lost at sea for close to three days.“I had an image of her being hungry and thirsty,” he said. “I tried to get into her head and think of what she would do. I imagined her beginning to despair and I thought of her doing whatever she could to survive.”Although an accomplished seafarer, the Warkworth native had not been seen since 1 November when, driven by the desire to “stretch her legs”, she had left the yacht she was helping to sail from Turkey to Athens and rowed in a dinghy to the nearby island of Folegandros.A text message from the Aegean isle was the last anyone had heard of her. Sent to Mike, the Englishman she was travelling with, it stated she was on her way back to the yacht. But that was before she had lost control of the inflatable dinghy after an oar had fallen overboard and then been driven off course by strong winds.Marietakis, 46, knew she might be preparing for the worse. “We were brought in after seven vessels, a combat helicopter and military plane had failed to find her,” he said from his base in Heraklion, the Cretan capital, on Tuesday. “All my thoughts were trained on finding this one human being. I knew that if we didn’t, she would probably not survive.”In 19 years of heading search-and rescue-operations on the high seas, the coastguard officer says he has learned to train himself to “focus solely on the senses where nothing else exists and you can almost see better and hear better”.“We were looking for this little speck of a grey dinghy that in the ocean was so indistinguishable and so hard to see,” he said. “A plane and a helicopter had flown over the same area. She had spotted both and each time tried to catch their attention and they had missed her.”It took Marietakis and his two-man crew more than four hours to reach the waters between Folegandros and Crete, 60 nautical miles north-west of Heraklion, where the dinghy was eventually found.Stein, wearing a waterproof jacket, gym trousers and trainers, waved frantically. “She was clearly exhausted but very level-headed, very composed,” he said. “She had gone without fresh water and I think had begun to despair. She had survived on boiled sweets, which she had kept in a tiny pouch. By the time we found her, she said she had one left.”The hardy New Zealander was wet, cold and dehydrated when the Greek rescuers lifted her to safety. Plainly fearing the worst, she had taken the precautionary measure of writing her mother’s name and contact details on the side of the dinghy.But, as an experienced sailor, she had also done everything she possibly could to survive – wrapping herself in the few plastic bags she had with her, rationing the boiled sweets, her only source of sustenance, and regularly drying out her socks – her mother, Wendy, told media outlets in New Zealand.When search aircraft flew overhead, she tried to catch their attention by waving the one oar she still had.“She had drifted a very long way, over 40 nautical miles south of Folegandros,” said Marietakis, adding that the crew gave her water, coffee and croissant as soon as she was on board. “She was so happy. She hugged and kissed us but, if truth be told, I don’t know who was more overjoyed, us or her. We had saved a human being and she had survived to tell the tale.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad8ec55df7b51719982ed8e7f035bb5d6ff12fa/259_280_2804_1682/master/2804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840c16d4816c16e966566915d1263d03","title":"teenagers sentenced for of irish 14 year old ana kriegel","story":"Boys, now 15, are youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder Two teenage boys have been sentenced to life and 15 years respectively for murdering a schoolgirl who was lured to an abandoned house, savagely beaten and sexually assaulted in a case that has horrified Ireland.A judge in the central criminal court in Dublin on Tuesday sentenced one boy to life in detention, with the sentence to be reviewed after 12 years. The other received 15 years, with the sentence to be reviewed after eight years.They were 13 when they killed Ana Kriégel, 14, in a derelict house in the Dublin suburb of Lucan in May 2018. Because of their age they were not named and were referred to as Boy A and Boy B.Now 15, they became the youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder when the jury returned unanimous verdicts in June after a harrowing seven-week trial that evoked comparisons to the 1993 James Bulger atrocity.Mr Justice Paul McDermott deferred sentencing until this week to take into account probation and psychological reports.He said the killers could gain freedom while they were still relatively young men. “When that will be is not yet determined but much is based on your behaviour and attitude during your detention.”Addressing both boys, he said: “You will have to carry the guilt and shame of your involvement for the rest of your lives … at least you will have the opportunity to reconstruct yours in a positive way. Will you take it? You have the opportunity for a future and second chance, something you so wrongfully and cruelly denied to Ana.”He said Ana’s life was of “supreme importance” and that she had lived it “with energy, fun, imagination, love, dancing and music”.Prosecutors said Boy B called at Ana’s house and led her to a nearby derelict house where Boy A, whom she had a crush on, was waiting. He had assembled a “murder kit”: zombie mask, black gloves, shin guards, knee pads. His weapons were a long stick and a concrete block.Boy A received an eight-year sentence for sexual assault, to run concurrently with the murder sentence.During the trial, Boy A denied murder but the court heard he now appears to have accepted he killed Ana. He still denies sexual assault. Boy B admitted watching his friend attack Ana but still maintains his innocence in the murder.The boys will remain in Oberstown, Ireland’s only child detention campus, until they turn 18, when they will be moved to an adult prison to serve the balance of their sentence.The judge said there was little guidance relating to sentencing children for murder because “thankfully” there were so few cases. He had the power to impose a life term but that was not mandatory in the case of minors.In a victim impact statement, Ana’s mother, Geraldine, eulogised her daughter, who was adopted from Russia as a toddler, and spoke of the anguish of losing her.“She was wild and wonderful, electric, so full of fun, madness and laughter … she was the love of our lives.”She said there was no way to describe the pain and nightmares that followed the murder. “We brought Ana to live in a ‘safe’ place, a quiet country village, a leafy suburb, where the only sounds in the morning are doves cooing. No one could suspect the evil that lay in waiting for her. No one could anticipate the darkness that swirled in the souls of those that murdered and violated her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf2f040f4980bda5261bd52a93df4e86023b4a/0_0_4526_2715/master/4526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1f0323d696f7dd2266f5275f9ae5b1","title":"vladimir putin calls for reliable russian version of wikipedia","story":"President says user-edited site should be replaced with Big Russian EncyclopaediaVladimir Putin has called for the creation of a more “reliable” Russian version of Wikipedia.The president told a Kremlin meeting on the future of the Russian language: “As for Wikipedia … it’s better to replace it with the new Big Russian Encyclopaedia in electronic form,” RIA Novosti news agency reported. “At least that will be reliable information, presented in a good, modern way.”Putin was referring to a Russian encyclopaedia published between 2007 and 2014 in paper form.The government plans to allocate nearly 1.7bn rubles (£20.7m) to developing a Russian online reference resource similar to Wikipedia in the next three years, according to government documents published in September.Putin was responding to a comment by a university rector who complained about the use of Wikipedia by courts to reach verdicts.The widely used Russian-language Wikipedia, known as Vikipedia, says it has more than 1.5m articles.In 2015, Russia briefly banned Wikipedia over an entry on a form of cannabis.

It also exposed a rift between normal Gulf allies, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.In August, the separatists took control of Aden, which has served as the beleaguered government’s base since it was ousted from Sana’a by Houthi rebels in 2014.The agreement, formally sealed at a signing ceremonyin Riyadh on Tuesday, is short on specifics but is expected to share out ministries equally between the UN-backed government led by Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the backers of the president of the Southern Transitional Council, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi.Speaking at the signing ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described the deal as “a joyful day in Saudi as the two sides come together”.Donald Trump, who rarely comments on the civil war in Yemen, hailed the agreement as “a very good start”, adding “please all work hard to get a final deal”.Elements of the deal include the return of the UN-backed government to Aden within seven days to reactivate state institutions. The separatists also agreed to disband their militias, which would be integrated into Hadi’s forces within three months.The STC will have a right to be represented fully in any talks on the future of Yemen overseen by the UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths.Griffiths said the agreement was “an important step for our collective efforts to advance a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Yemen. Listening to southern stakeholders is important to the political efforts to achieve peace in the country.”Griffiths had been anxious to avoid excluding the southern forces, since any agreement reached without their inclusion was likely to fall apart. But observers will be anxious to see if the alliance, assuming it holds, simply leads to a reinvigorated militarily assault on Houthi positions, or instead leads to substantive talks on Yemen’s future.In a sign of the tensions over the agreement, an assassination attempt was made last week on Yemen’s ministers of interior and transport in the southern province of Shabwah, just hours after an initial deal between the two sides was agreed.In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has increased its military presence in southern Yemen, airlifting in additional troops, armoured vehicles, tanks and other military equipment. And since July, the UAE has been pulling troops out of Yemen, leaving the coalition with a weakened ground presence and fewer tactical options."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4073202.1572972106!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"forever is not long enough kriegel family speak after sentencing","story":"Patrick and Geraldine Kriegel  made an brief statement outside the Central Criminal Court after the sentencing of two boys for the murder of their daughter Ana. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Geraldine and Patric Kriégel at the Criminal Courts of Justice after the sentencing hearing.

It remains prone to sudden swings in price, which some attribute to market manipulation by so-called bitcoin whales that are able to influence the price through a single trade.A flash crash that wiped $1,000 from bitcoin\u0027s value in less than an hour was triggered by the sale of 5,000 bitcoins - worth around $40 million at the time of the trade.It remains a long way off its 2017 highs, though some market analysts believe its upward trajectory will likely continue in the long term.CoinMarketCap)Other cryptocurrency experts claim that despite the historical turmoil, bitcoin will continue to rise in price and could eventually recover to 2017 levels.Some advocates even believe bitcoin is still a long way from reaching its full price potential, with figures like John McAfee and Tim Draper arguing that its scarcity means it could grow more than 25-fold in value over the next few years.Russian nuclear scientist caught mining bitcoin in top-secret lab“$250,000 means that bitcoin would then have about a 5 per cent market share of the currency world and I think that may be understating the power of bitcoin,” Mr Draper said in September.Mr McAfee, who founded the eponymous antivirus firm, is even more bullish in his forecast, having recently stood by his notorious prediction\u0026nbspthat bitcoin would hit $1 million by the end of 2020.A website set up to track his prediction shows that it is currently more than 90 per cent behind being on track.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

plans to prepare for Brexit, and just under three in 10 have put plans in place specifically for a no-deal scenario. Almost a quarter (22 per cent) have specific plans which prepare them for a Brexit extension.Rosie Bailey of CitySprint, said: “SMEs sit right at the heart of our economy. While it’s great to see that they feel upbeat and resilient, thanks to many years spent flexing their business to suit the times, it’s clear that they also need some extra support to help navigate the specific complexities of Brexit.“With time running out, business owners should take immediate steps to seek out the information they need to understand the potential impact of Brexit in whatever form it takes and put clear plans in place to help their organisation mitigate these.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New research provides an answer, one that experts say could change the scientific understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and inspire new ideas about how to prevent and treat it.In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers say the woman, whose name they withheld to protect her privacy, has another mutation that has protected her from dementia even though her brain has developed a major neurological feature of Alzheimer’s disease.This ultra-rare mutation appears to help stave off the disease by minimising the binding of a particular sugar compound to an important gene. That finding suggests that treatments could be developed to give other people that same protective mechanism.Created with Sketch.Health news in pictures Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A vaping-related lung disease has claimed the lives of 11 people in the US in recent weeks.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.“I’m very excited to see this new study come out – the impact is dramatic,” said Dr Yadong Huang, a senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes, who was not involved in the research. “For both research and therapeutic development, this new finding is very important.”A drug or gene therapy would not be available any time soon because scientists first need to replicate the protective mechanism found in this one patient by testing it in laboratory animals and human brain cells.Still, this case comes at a time when the Alzheimer’s field is craving new approaches after billions of dollars have been spent on developing and testing treatments and some 200 drug trials have failed. It has been more than 15 years since the last treatment for dementia was approved, and the few drugs available do not work very well for very long.The woman is entering her late 70s now and lives in Medellin, the epicentre for the world’s largest family to experience Alzheimer’s. It is an extended Colombian family of about 6,000 people whose members have been plagued with dementia for centuries, a condition they called “La Bobera” – “the foolishness” – and attributed to superstitious causes.What to do if you suspect a loved one is developing dementiaDecades ago\u0026nbspa Colombian neurologist, Dr Francisco Lopera, began painstakingly collecting the family’s birth and death records in Medellin and remote Andes mountain villages. He documented the sprawling family tree and took dangerous risks in guerrilla and drug-trafficking territory to cajole relatives of people who died with dementia into giving him their brains for analysis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So Dr\u0026nbspLopera and a team of American scientists have spent years studying the family, searching for answers both to help the Colombians and to address the mounting epidemic of the more typical old-age Alzheimer’s disease.When they found that the woman had the Presenilin 1 mutation, but had not yet even developed a pre-Alzheimer’s condition called mild cognitive impairment, the scientists were mystified.“We have a single person who is resilient to Alzheimer’s disease when she should be at high risk,” said Dr Eric Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix and a leader of the research team.The woman was flown to Boston, where some of the researchers are based, for brain scans and other tests. Those results were puzzling, said Yakeel Quiroz, a Colombian neuropsychologist who directs the familial dementia neuroimaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital.She has a secret in her biology ... This case is a big window to discover new approachesThe woman’s brain was laden with the foremost hallmark of Alzheimer’s: plaques of amyloid protein.“The highest levels of amyloid that we have seen so far,” said Ms Quiroz, adding that the excessive amyloid probably accumulated because the woman has lived much longer than other family members with the Alzheimer’s-causing mutation.But the woman had few other neurological signs of the disease – not much of a protein called tau, which forms tangles in Alzheimer’s brains, and little neurodegeneration or brain atrophy.“Her brain was functioning really well,” said Ms Quiroz, who, like Dr Reiman, is a senior author of the study. “Compared to people who are 45 or 50, she’s actually better.”She said the woman, who raised four children, had only one year of formal education and could barely read or write, so it was unlikely her cognitive protection came from educational stimulation.New Alzheimer’s blood test could diagnose disease before symptoms show“She has a secret in her biology,” Dr\u0026nbspLopera said. “This case is a big window to discover new approaches.”Ms Quiroz consulted Dr\u0026nbspJoseph Arboleda-Velasquez, who, like her, is an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School (he is also Ms\u0026nbspQuiroz’s husband). Dr Arboleda-Velasquez, a cell biologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, conducted extensive genetic testing and sequencing, determining that the woman has an extremely rare mutation on a gene called APOE.The Colombian woman has two copies of APOE3, the variant that most people are born with – but both copies have a mutation called Christchurch (for the New Zealand city where it was discovered). The Christchurch mutation is extremely rare, but several years ago, Dr\u0026nbspReiman’s daughter Rebecca, a technologist, helped determine that a handful of Colombian family members have that mutation on one of their APOE genes. They developed Alzheimer’s as early as their family members typically did.“The fact that she had two copies, not just one, really kind of sealed the deal,” Dr Arboleda-Velasquez said.Dr\u0026nbspGuojun Bu, who studies APOE, said that while the findings involved a single case and more research is needed, the implications could be profound.“When you have delayed onset of Alzheimer’s by three decades, you say wow,” said Dr Bu, chairman of the neuroscience department at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, who was not involved in the study.He said the research suggests that instead of drugs attacking amyloid or tau, which have failed in many clinical trials, a medication or gene therapy targeting APOE could be promising.First drug to slow Alzheimer’s disease could soon be on the marketDr Reiman, who led another newly published study showing that APOE has a bigger impact on a person’s risk of getting Alzheimer’s than previously thought, said potential treatments could try to reduce or even silence APOE activity in the brain. People born without APOE appear to have no cognitive problems, but they do have very high cholesterol that requires treatment.Dr Huang, who co-wrote a commentary about the study and is affiliated with two companies focusing on potential APOE-related treatments, said the findings also challenge a leading Alzheimer’s theory about the role of amyloid.Since the woman had huge amounts of amyloid but few other Alzheimer’s indicators, “it actually illustrates, to my knowledge for the first time, a very clear dissociation of amyloid accumulation from tau pathology, neurodegeneration and even cognitive decline,” he said.Dr Lopera said the woman is just beginning to develop dementia, and he recently disclosed her genetic profile to her four adult children, who each have only one copy of the Christchurch mutation.The researchers are also evaluating a few other members of the Colombian family, who appear to also have some resistance to Alzheimer’s. They are not as old as the woman, and they do not have the Christchurch mutation, but the team hopes to find other genetic factors from studying them and examine whether those factors operate along the same or different biological pathways, Dr Reiman said.“We’ve learned that at least one inidual can live for very long having the cause of Alzheimer’s, and she’s resistant to it,” Dr Arboleda-Velasquez said. “What this patient is teaching is there could be a pathway for correcting the disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame. The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings.

The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace.

When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.There will also be projects in partnership\u0026nbspwith National Museums Liverpool, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle and the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.Director of the National Portrait Gallery Dr Nicholas Cullinan said: This is a unique and important chapter in our history as we embark on our journey to deliver a transformed National Portrait Gallery, which will enable us to become more welcoming and engaging to all and fulfil our role as the nation\u0027s family album.“We are delighted to be able to partner with organisations across the UK and internationally to share our Collection to new and existing audiences.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The resident initially thought Wandi was a stray dog or a fox and soon took him to Bec Day, a local veterinarian.Wandi\u0027s original journey may have ended with him being dinner for an eagle or other bird of prey. Instead, the young pup was likely dropped from its captors’ talons, Ms Day told ABC, noting what appeared to be claw marks on Wandi\u0027s back.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job. But their job deserves our unequivocal respect and gratitude.PRESENTER Samira Ahmed is suing her employers at the BBC for £, in pay because she received a fraction of what Jeremy Vine was paid for allegedly “similar” work.I like Samira Ahmed on Newswatch and wish her well.But Jeremy Vine is far more of a household name. And when it comes to getting paid, star power matters more than gender.I would like to be banking the same royalty cheques for my books as JK Rowling. But best not to hold my breath.IN the Eighties I did a story on the politan Police’s Vice Squad, which logged the contents of the pornographic videos they seized while watching the raunchy action in fast-forward.I can still recall the bored, joyless expressions of the young Vice Squad coppers as they yawned through all that fast-forwarded filth.Now Netflix is offering the same sort of thing – aallowing viewers to watch shows at up to one-and-a-half times the normal speed. Don’t bother.If it’s not worth watching in real time, it’s not worth watching at all.THERE are million dog owners in the UK and I can’t have been the only one who cringed to hear President Trump boasting that IS monster Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had “died like a dog”. And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President. But there is really no need to talk like one.THE traditional Guy Fawkes Night celebrations of my childhood have largely been replaced by Halloween.This makes me incredibly sad, although my we says Halloween is far less dangerous than all the bonfires and bangers of my boyhood.But did you see this outfit Craig Revel Horwood sported on Halloween ROBBIE WILLIAMS, , has challenged Liam Gallagher, , to a boxing match.Really not recommended at their age. How long is it since Britpop   years Stick to a game of draughts, Robbie.I WAS forced to play rugby at school and always hated it.But I have fallen in love with the sport at this glorious World Cup in Japan.But North kept running – or hobbling – and STILL made the tackle.I do hope our soft Premier League footballers have been watching.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Happily, though, most of us know that, these days, coercion and force in the bedroom are not only ­unromantic but unacceptable.The offending lyrics in the song, which is a duet, are uttered by the female voice, which sings: “I simply must go, the answer is no” . . . only for the man she is singing to to hand her a drink — and for her to question what is in it. Obviously not good on any level. But this song was written in  .It was a hit during a time when sex was for marriage, and women weren’t actually allowed to express any active interest in men so had to feign modesty at all times. In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches. Witness Heidi Klum’s Frankenstein costume at her annual Halloween party in New York this week.The dress code seems to be wear what you like as long as it’s thigh-high, PVC or a bikini – with some fake blood. Dressing up should be banned – I haven’t done it since I was seven.ENGLAND’S poor rugby team. Yesterday they lost in the final of the World Cup after being fined for their response to the Kiwi pre-match Haka in the semi-final.Owen Farrell and Co stood in a “V” formation while the Haka went on. But it turns out they were supposed to remain in their own half, and some players didn’t.New Zealand’s Haka is all about intimidating the opposition. But the opposition are not allowed to respond The Haka is a dance about cutting off people’s heads.But it was England’s harmless response of standing still and forming a V for Victory – which I thought was brilliant – that was reprimanded.MY goodness, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley looks utterly gorgeous in her underwear.MS using her as a model is possibly its best marketing decision ever.You only have to look at her wearing nothing but white lace to think thatyou buy the same set, some of her beauty might rub off on you.I loved the comment from Cheryl Tweedy in response to Rosie’s Insta post: “And where do we get that body ”Nowonly that, too, was available to buy from MS.LOVED reading the stories this week from Angela Kelly, who dressed the Queen for  years.I particularly liked how she helped to avoid disaster at the  Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur after the Queen’s hat arrived at the last minute. Her Majesty had been due to wear the hat as she officially closed the games but was distraught to find that it was unsuitable.I wouldn’t normally bother reading tittle-tattle stories about the Queen, but knowing that she has consented for them to be told I am really enjoying them.Also, the closest this great lady has got to making a mistake in  years is to wear her hat the wrong way round . . . which speaks volumes about her, doesn’t it Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma. But the blighter Bercow has gone at last.Long live the new Speaker, whoever he or she may be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang. Go figure.Seven Worlds, One Planet cutting and pasting that horrendous old footage of the sky-ing walruses.A BBC continuity woman deciding His Dark Materials is our “new Sunday night obsession”. .The slyly partisan One Show featuring a film with Corbynista Ken Loach calling for “real change”, on the day the election was called.And arch-luvvie David Tennant describing the responsibility of murdering one Proclaimers song for Children In Need: Got It Covered as: “A bit like National Service.”For you or the viewers, David THE guessing games begin as soon as the opening credits for BBC’s big new Sunday night drama kick in and reveal it’s set in a parallel universe.A place where relationships between humans and their animal soul-mates are unusually close.Swindon “Oxford.”Oooh, close, but no cigar at the start of His Dark Materials, an epic, eight-part adaptation of author Philip Pullman’s trilogy that’ll probably go down well with anyone who’s read the books and loves fantasy adventure.Unfortunately, I haven’t read the books and hate fantasy adventure.My loss, I realise. It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Access to books at any age is the key to loving to read and loving to learn.“Most of us have a clear memory of reading that one book that opened the door to seek more knowledge.“The right book at the right time alters a le.”Her beloved dad died in  aged . Last year she gave away her hundred millionth book.Dolly says: “My Daddy told me he was more proud of the Imagination Library than anything I’d ever done. I feel the same way because I truly believe this effort will last many years after I am gone.”Dolly’s ambitious book scheme has expanded all across the US, Canada, Australia and the UK, with Rotherham the first British town to sign up in .So she jumped at the chance to support our initiative, which has seen us team up with publisher HarperCollins to give away up to £million-worth of brilliant books to schools.New figures from the National Literacy Trust show a drop of more than five per cent in the number of primary-aged children who read every day compared to last year. And only  per cent of primary children read outside of school.We want to reverse these trends. Each primary school that successfully registers and collects enough tokens will receive a case of Collins Big Cat reading books containing more than  titles, worth more than £.Dolly’s Imagination Library sees children whose families sign up posted free books, funded via charitable giving.The singer says: “We’re trying to bring this gt to all children, whether they are from Scotland or Mississippi. Whether they are rich or poor. Or whether they live in towns or live in the country.“I am all about the values we all share in this world — love, respect, acceptance, integrity and commitment.”Born in The Great Smoky Mountains, Dolly was the fourth of  children to parents Avie and Lee.She says she is incredibly proud that her dad lived long enough to hear kids call her “The Book Lady”.Dolly adds: “This all starts with my daddy. He was a smart, smart man but he could not read or write. He never had the chance to go to school because he was a working man from day one. I could see how his inability to read or write held him back.“So I thought, ‘One day I am going to try to do something so all kids would at least have the opportunity to love books and to love reading’.”Children from big mountain families like Dolly’s dad often didn’t get the chance to go to school, and Dolly believes he could have done so much morehe wasn’t illiterate.Her loving parents encouraged Dolly to escape her “dirt poor existence” — largely thanks to her love of music and books. By six she was performing in her local church and at eight she had started to write songs.But she didn’t like school — with other kids picking on her because of her ragged clothes. She recalled once: “A lot of the parents didn’t want their kids running with me because I looked so cheap and tacky.”Books, however, offered an escape from her harsh youth.After the Bible, Dolly remembers the first book she read was The Little Engine That Could, a s American fairytale used to teach children the value of optimism and hard work. She says: “I have always loved its message of ‘I think I can’. What a wonderful way to encourage children to dream and to believe in themselves.“When I was growing up in the hills of East Tennessee, I knew my dreams would come true. I know there are children everywhere with their own dreams. They dream of becoming a doctor or an inventor or a minister.“Who knows, maybe there is a little girl whose dream is to be a writer and singer. But the seeds of these dreams are often found in books — and the seeds you help plant in your community can grow across the world.”Reading, according to Dolly, is the bedrock you need to write. She has written more than , songs, including Whitney Houston’s  global smash I Will Always Love You, has won a Grammy and has been nominated for two Oscars for her songwriting.Dolly, who in  read Louise Yates’ Dog Loves Books on CBeebies’ Bedtime Stories, says reading keeps her mind sharp as well as underpinning her music. She reads at least one book a week.Her favourites include Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen and The Count Of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. She has said previously: “I’ve just always been a reader. There’s a part of my brain that can kind of think of other things while I am reading. It does relax my body, and I’ve always just loved to read.“I think, with kids, too, with the books that they read, it kind of inspires you to dream. If you can dream, that’ll lead you to success and to other things.”Dolly’s achievements outstrip even her wildest dreams. As well as her musical accolades, she has also appeared in box office hits including  To  in  and Steel Magnolias in , while her US theme park Dollywood attracts .million visitors a year.But she reckons the best accolade is the delight experienced by children she gives books to from the age of five.She says: “Nothing beats the child’s excitement about receiving their very own book in the mail with their name on it.”“And, ‘Dang, she looks good for her age!’”TCs apply.

I knew something must be bad because they’re normally quite tough.By the morning they were blistering and I knew something was seriously wrong.They are readily available abroad and are sometimes offered in the UK at festivals and fairs.However, the NHS warns these tattoos can contain high levels of toxic chemical dye, which it is normally illegal to use on the skin.The paste contains an ingredient called paraphenylenediamine . In the EU, this chemcial can legally be used in hair dyes - but not for tattoos.Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explained: When applied to the skin in the form of a black henna temporary tattoo, PPD can cause chemical burns and lead to allergic reactions.In extreme cases, black henna tattoos can lead to swelling, blistering and permanent scarring of the skin.Black henna tattoos can also increase sensitivity to PPD, meaning you could have a serious allergic reaction to legal hair dyes.The boys were rushed to AE where medics confirmed they had a skin reaction caused by chemical burns.Doctors scraped the skin from their arms and have been applying moisturiser over the past week - with the twins having to repeat the process over the next  months.Vicki said: I’m living in hope it won’t scar them for le and that their skin will grow into it.If by sharing what happened to us we can stop someone ’s children being scarred then it will be worth it.On The Beach, who organised the two-week package holiday for the family, have confirmed the salon has been closed while they investigate.In June, we told how a five-year-old boy suffered nasty chemical burns from a black henna tattoo on while on holiday in Bali.And in May, a seven-year-old boy was left with horric scars after getting a temporary inking done on a family trip to Spain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the meantime, it’s important to take whatever diabetes medication helps you to manage your blood sugar levels properly to prevent long term complications.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are lots of things he could be angry about with the people currently sitting above you – electoral fraud, using the NHS as a weapon, Brexiters campaigning against Brexit, Remainers who canapost agree on remaining – but the thing he is livid about is the Armed Forces Covenant. Not the idea of it, which is to ensure military personnel suffer no disadvantage due to their service, and sometimes get preferential treatment because of it. Nor the way it was enshrined in law in  with much fanfare, and the then-Prime Minister promising to “treat people with the dignity they deserve”.    No, he’s angry about the fact that within a year of it being made law, Parliament pissed on it.

He knows that everyone suffered in the past decade of cuts to public services. But he points out that those who are more in need of them always suffer most, and that only half of veterans who need that help ever ask for it. Heaposs particularly angry about the current governmentaposs commitment to the covenant, and the debt of honour it represents. He remarks bitterly that theyaposve finally signed it,  years on, and all that means is that the Tory party is now eligible for an employer recognition award. Oh, and theyaposve updated the the website.    Heaposs angry at the state of military housing,  years after the government said selling it off was a grand idea. Heaposs furious at the way his family had to go on a council waiting list. At how,they rent privately, a grasping landlord will rack up the rent for a building unfit for human habitation while their benefit is slashed. At how politicians call people who have to live in those homes scroungers, and say they should be put down. Heaposs angry at a Defence Select Committee report which said the Ministry of Defence was immoral and incompetent, and at a minimum income requirement for immigrants which blocks Commonwealth soldiers settling in the country they shed blood for. He quotes the committee chairman, who said: Every year we take evidence on the implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant, and every year we report similar complaints. The Government is failing in its moral obligation towards those who serve or have served in our armed forces. Heaposs angry about his mates killed for want of proper equipment, at a private defence industry quite literally make a killing with state-funded trips to dictatorial regimes, and heaposs angry at mealy-mouthed letters from politicians thanking him for his service and telling him thereaposs nothing they can do. He says politicians stand with the armed forces when it suits them, but turn their backs when it costs.    As he talks you realise youaposre angry, too. Youaposre angry about a Parliament that stopped governing in the nationaposs interest, and spent  years arguing over a thing that could not be done, purely because theyaposd staked their careers on it. Youaposre angry about allies who behave like enemies, knighthoods for men who hit women, a vice-admiral who consorted with a paedophile rapist yet keeps his pension, and his rank. Youaposre angry that because the people who took it upon themselves to run the country are unable to do so, youaposve been asked to re-elect Islamophobes, anti-Semites, incompetents and rabble-rousers so they can have another go at cocking things up, on a starting salary of £, a year.    You donapost like politicians pitting you against your neighbours because of how they pray or the colour of their skin. Youaposre perplexed about schools that have to shut down one day a week, about a NHS winter crisis that lasts all year, about a minimum wage which isnapost enough to live on. You thought all that crap was supposed to be over, by now. You remember how you were promised electoral reform in  and it never materialised. You wonder about the worth of a system that tells the critically ill to get up and work. You wonder how disabled people can have a better le without the allowances they need to pay for independent living.You realise that many veterans are disabled. And they are given the same crappy treatment as everyone , and often have to fight harder to be compensated by the employer who put them in harmaposs way.    You think about at your local postmaster, corner shop owner, launderette, binman, cabbie, cleaner, nurse, teaching assistant, council operative and heaven knows who  and wonder how, precisely, we’ll manage without migrants, and whoaposll be coming up with the points-based system youaposre told is such a great idea. Perhaps you look at your own bloodline. Perhaps you look at the history books. Perhaps, in the words of those who talk of sedition, treachery and surrender, you hear the echoes of bad people from bad times. You think about the fact .million people who could vote last time didn’t bother. You remind yourself thereaposs more than a million people missing from the electoral register - who should be on it, could be on it, but donapost see the point. You stand there, feeling angry, and think about how  years ago a war veteran with  yearsapos fighting behind him, who worshipped the same God in a dferent way, who felt oppressed and angry about promises his rulers had made and broken, stood in the undercroft of the Houses of Parliament with  barrels of gunpowder, some coal and firewood, and matches in his pocket.    You think about how that veteran was seized and dragged before the king, how he and his fellow plotters were tortured with the rack and other instruments for  weeks to produce confessions, and how after a show trial they were taken to the yard outside Parliament so the politicians could watch as they were hung by the neck, cut down while still alive, castrated, disembowelled, and cut into pieces. Perhaps you know enough to remember that despite injuries so bad he could barely sign his own confession, Guy Fawkes was brave and quick enough to jump from the scaffold before the executioner could stop him, breaking his own neck and saving himself the extra agonies the state wanted to inflict. You wonder why we still celebrate the capture, torture and death of that man with a bonfire and fireworks, why we have forgotten that it was once laid down in law we had to do so whether we agreed or not, and that for centuries his desperation was used to persecute others who shared his faith.    You wonder how we all forgot why he was so angry, or that after he was gone the oppression for people like him simply got worse, and lasted for more than  years. You remind yourself we live in a country where Catholics were banned from marrying senior Royals until , all because Henry VIII took against them. Perhaps youaposd also wonder what the authorities would do to that Afghanistan veteranhe was caught red-handed with his bomb under Parliament, and how it would compare to what they would dohe was Muslim. You look over your shoulder at the door, and youaposre glad no-oneaposs come along yet. Maybe you wish him luck, and tell him that as Fawkes said on the rack a desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy. First photos of how temporary House of Commons will look in £BILLION refurb   Maybe you will try to talk him out of it, or go to find a policeman in the hope heaposll get help and the people who put themselves above will finally listen to those left below. Perhaps youaposre prepared to be optimistic about his chances of getting the help he was promised, and that he needs. Me  I think Iaposd quietly turn around, close the door, stick my elbow in the fire alarm and then let him get on with it.

Mr Rees-Mogg “profoundly” apologised for suggesting Grenfell victims should have used common sense and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block. Mr Rees-Mogg’s apology came after an LBC appearance on Monday, during which the Commons leader had discussed London Fire Brigadeapossaposstay-putapos policy and said: If you just ignore what youaposre told and leave you are so much safer. I thinkeither of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didnapost happen. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen defended the Commons leaderaposs comments, suggesting he would have made a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.    And he said: We want very clever people running the country, donapost we  He told BBC Radio ’s PM programme: He is an extremely intelligent and compassionate human being and his comments regarding Grenfell were uncharacteristically clumsy but we have to put them into the context of Jacob. Jacob is a leader, he is an authority figure and what he has failed to realise is that in a le-threatening and stressful situation most people, most of the public, will probably defer to the advice of an authority figure – be that someone from the fire authority or the police – and not come to their own conclusions. As we know with regard to Grenfell, that advice was flawed. Host Evan Davies told Mr Bridgen people had taken issue with the suggestion that Mr Rees-Mogg would not have died because he was cleverer than the people who took the fire brigadeaposs advice, Mr Bridgen said: But we want very clever people running the country, don’t we, Evan  That is a by-product of what Jacob is and that is why he is in a position of authority. What he’s actually saying is that he would have given a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.   Labour MP David Lammy called on Mr Rees-Mogg to resign.He said: “I’m disgusted, shocked. I’m thinking about those poor people who lost their lives, including my friend Khadija. When you look through the report, it’s clear that many of them stayed put because they were advised to do so. To describe them as lacking common sense is not just insensitive, it’s unforgiveable. These are people who had been complaining - about the building, the renovation, the conditions they were living in. It’s clear that there was flammable cladding. We find out that there were firemen who could have knocked on doors, who didn’t. All the rest of it. And they lacked common sense  It’s such a sort of arrogant and superior point of view: ‘those poor people in council houses’  Of course he should resign. It’s a scandal.”“Today you see what people like Jacob Rees-Mogg really think. And they basically think it was their fault. And I think that’s just ugly, and slightly sinister really.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf it had been successful, British history could have looked VERY dferent. On November , , Guy Fawkes was caught with just minutes to spare before the plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament reached its completion. The failed Gunpowder Plot is celebrated every Bonfire Night across the UK with huge blazes and fireworks. But had it not been for a single, cryptic letter, the plan could have been a success and the anti-Catholic government, along with King James I, would have been blown sky high. The gunpowder plot was the brainchild of a group of British Catholics led by Robert Catesby.    The man tasked with lighting the gunpowder that would have set off the huge explosion fell to Guido Fawkes, better known as Guy. He was specially enlisted by the group, who travelled to Spain, where he was serving in the military, to secure his services. A committed Catholic, Fawkes didnapost need much persuasion toto England and become central to the murderous plot. As the group feverishly planned, Baron Monteagle William Parker, was sent a hard to decipher letter from a mystery writer. He had been raised a Catholic and had even been involved in previous plots to unseat the government, organised by those of his faith.    Catholics had hoped King James would be more tolerant of their religion than the previous monarch, Queen Elizabeth I, but were still being persecuted. By the time the plot to blow up parliament was being spun, however, Baron Monteagle was a firm friend of the crown. As a member of the House of Lords, he would have been required to attend the opening of parliament on the day it was due to be blown up. He received the cryptic correspondence while eating his supper at his home on Hoxton, London. Despite the message being unclear what was apparent was that it warned of a plot to blow up the king and parliament. My lord, out of the love I have for some of your friends, I want to make sure you are safe. Because of this I would advise you to not attend this sitting of parliament because God and man have agreed to punish the wickedness of this time. Do not think this is a joke, go to your estate in the country where you will be safe, because although there is no sign of any problem yet, this parliament will receive a terrible blow, but they will not see who it is that hurts them. This advice should not be ignored as it may do you some good, and it can do you no harm because the danger will have passed as soon as you have burned this letter. I hope God grants you the grace to make good use of it, and that he protects you.   To this day it is still not clear who penned the missive. One rumour is the Baron Monteagle wrote it himself to earn brownie points with the king. But others insist it was sent to him to protect him, possible by his sister or one of the conspirators who remembered how he had once helped them. Initially, Baron Monteagle dismissed the letter as nonsense but its dire warning, urging him to stay away from parliament on November  kept eating away at his worries. Eventually, he decoded the meaning - that something horric would happen on the night the king opened parliament - and he handed it into the government. It was shown to the king and a search of the houses of parliament was order, with Baron Monteagle among those involved in the hunt.

Appearing in the dock at Carlisle Crown Court the defendant was jailed for  years.    Judge Jeremy Lasker, sentencing, said: You subjected her to a sustained and wholly gratuitous assault You are, in my view, a very dangerous man indeed.

It took Holly Atkinson, , eight years to have a baby after initially suffering a miscarriage at .She and husband Mark, , then had their first round of IVF through the NHS but sadly two embryos did not develop after being transferred into her womb. But they went through a second cycle of IVF just months later and amazingly fell pregnant following a positive test in March . Holly gave birth to Holly gave birth to daughter Mia who weighed a healthy lbs and ozs on October ,  - coincidentally during National Fertility Week.    The couple decided they wanted a sibling for Mia while still in the maternity unit following her birth but knew they would need to go through a third round of IVF. They decided to undergo further fertility treatment through an egg sharing scheme at private clinic CARE fertility in Manchester last year. Through the treatment, Holly produced  eggs and selflessly donated  frozen eggs to enable another couple to have their own dream family. It proved to be a success but the couple, from Charnock Richard near Chorley, Lancashire, have not been given any other details other than gender and year of birth due to patient confidentiality. Holly, who works for Gallowayaposs Society for the Blind, said: Iaposm over the moon. Looking at my little girl and knowing I was able to do it for someone  makes me really proud.  We wanted to donate some of my eggs to another couple as a way of giving something back to someone who has not been as lucky as us. I did battle with it a little bit in my head at first but the feeling of happiness and pride quickly took over because I know what it means to have a baby. You canapost pick and choose but for us, it didnapost matter. For somebody to go through this process and the dficulties of infertility we know the baby will be going to a fantastic, deserving home. Sadly for Holly and Mark, their own third round of IVF didnapost work but the couple have one remaining frozen embryo left to try again for Miaaposs sibling. Of my , only two developed and I had one put back. I now have one frozen embryo left so we are hopeful for the future,she added.  I am desperate to be pregnant again and go through the entire experience all over because it was amazing, I loved it. Even though we have our little girl and had already experienced a negative test result in our first round, getting a negative more recently was still really hard. Holly says she would love to one day meet the child knows the decision is completely out of her hands. From my point of view, I would love to see a family unit that we have been able to create and see a child who was happy, she added. I would love to one day meet them but itaposs not my choice, itaposs completely out of my hands andit did happen I would want it to be for the right reasons for the other family and the child. Holly and Mark, a showroom fitter, first became an item after leaving school and quickly knew they wanted children because they wanted to share something which was just ours.  She came off the pill when the couple had an offer accepted on a house aged  and around  months later she fell pregnant, which sadly ended in a miscarriage. However, the couple were worried about theof time it took Holly to fall pregnant but say they were practically laughed at by doctors after airing their concerns given her young age.

The -year-old suffers from chronic pain caused by conditions affecting her spine, nerves and muscles, and suffers with mental health problems including anxiety and depression.Her debilitating illnesses eventually become too much and she resigned from her job, Hull Live reports.The last two years have been an absolute nightmare, she said.    I came out of a good job into no income, not knowing how to claim benefits She said she had been living in a property paying rent of £ per month, but contacted the landlord after she left work to say she would soon be unable to pay. I just didnapost know how to go from £, per year to less than £, per month, she said. But the landlord took legal action and by the time East Riding Council had offered to cover the rent, Miss Fowler had already been formally evicted. She was rehoused by the council three days before her eviction in . They said itaposd need decorating and offered me a £ decorating grant, she said. So I thought, aposWell thereaposs people in far worse situations, being homeless and things like thatapos. I went into the bedroom and it smelt like faeces. But they said I had no other option but to take it.    Miss Fowler said she spent the next nine months living with candles on and the windows open, regularly complaining to the council about the stench. I had officers from housing come round and say it just needed stripping and decorating, she said. But the smell just wouldnapost go and people kept commenting on it. She said she was hospitalised four times in that period because of vomiting and constant retching. I couldnapost keep my food down, I dropped to st lb, she said. I once retched for eight hours straight and couldnapost keep my meds down. I know that I ingested fecal spores. Then soon as the repairs were done and I moved back in, it stopped. It was not until December, nine months after she moved into the property, that the council placed her in alternative accommodation while they carried out the work.

Dan Sparrow, , leaped into action when we Vicki, , went into labour early in their living room, and gave birth before paramedics arrived. She had been booked in for a c-section due to a suspected placenta infection, and call handlers warned Dan on the phone he had to act quickly following the birth. After unravelling the cord which was twice wrapped around baby Kaydenaposs neck, he lay the newborn on his mumaposs tummy, and ran into the hallway in search of a tool. Half-dressed Dan grabbed his work trainers, pulled out a lace, and used it to clamp the umbilical cord. It took another  minutes for paramedics to arrive, and when the family got to hospital, nurses praised Dan for his actions. Guidance around cord-cutting is ied, but it has long been believed delaying cutting the cord can increase birth complications, especiallythere is risk of infection.    Dan, a building and landscape company owner, from Pontypridd, south Wales, said: The doctors were all saying Kayden wouldnapost survive a natural birth in hospital as it would be too traumatic for him to go through. So when I realised it was going to be a home birth I started to panic. Then when I realised it was all down to me I was absolutely terried. When Vickiaposs waters broke he just shot out. She was just silent and I was scared I would see my son die in my arms. The operator was telling me to grab anything I could cut the umbilical cord with. Thataposs when I caught sight of my work shoes in the hallway. I grabbed one them, balanced Kayden on Vickiaposs stomach and pulled the lace out. I was just making sure I had tied it up tight enough.    He cried for a few seconds but then he was quiet. He was still breathing but I was so scared. I didnapost want to see him die in my arms and for it to be something I did or didnapost do. Turns out I managed to do the right thing. When we got to the hospital I had the doctors and the nurses patting me on the back. Iaposve always been told Iaposm a fast learner but this is up there with one of the most impressive things Iaposve taken to! Vicki, a former hairdresser added: Iaposm just such a proud mum and we. For Kayden to defy the odds and for Dan to step up and save the day was one of the happiest days of my le. Vicki and Dan found out they were expecting their second baby last October - just weeks after booking their wedding venue.    But at their  week scan the couple were told their baby was too small and would need to be monitored with weekly scans and regular doppler monitoring. Vicki said: He was a twin but unfortunately his twin didnapost make it. The doctors ran some tests but they werenapost entire sure what the problem was. Only that he wasnapost developing. They said his lungs wouldnapost have developed properly so would have trouble breathing. The couple still sent forward with the wedding - six days before the birth - and size eight Vickiaposs bump was so little she didnapost even need to have her dress refitted. She was suffering with a suspected placenta infection, so was booked in for a planned c-section in  weeks, due to doctors fears over a natural labour. But Kayden had other ideas - and  days early Vicki woke up in the middle of the night with shooting stomach pains which she mistook for Braxton hicks. Vicki, who also has son Castiel, two, said: Iaposve had another baby so I know what labour feels like. But when Kayden was on the way I just shrugged them off as fake contractions. I donapost really remember too much. I just went into shock.    This just wasnapost meant to be happening. Dan added: We had been in and out of hospital every other day for the past however many months so the pregnancy was closely monitored. If he didnapost have all the complications I would have jumped at the chance at delivering him. But I suppose youaposve got to be careful what you wish for. It was the middle of the night when Vicki woke up and said she had pains. I was saying, aposright, Iaposm taking you to the hospital nowapos but she was brushing it off as trapped wind or braxton hicks. We went back to sleep but she woke up again and thataposs when we started rushing around. I carried her downstairs and put her on the sofa. Then her waters broke there. Thataposs when I started to worry. The doctors said he wouldnapost survive a natural birth in hospital. After I grabbed the towels and called  I could already see his head. It was sheer panic but I couldnapost freak out as I had to be there for Vicki and Kayden.    But I was genuinely worried I was going to see my son dead. He phoned  and a call handler gave him advice, and  minutes their baby was born - with paramedics still to arrive. The woman on the end of the phone was amazing and she did help steer me in the right direction, he said. When he came out the umbilical cord had wrapped itself around his neck twice. Not only did I not know what I was doing, I didnapost want to unravel it because he was so tiny. I literally had his le in my hands. Then the woman was saying I had to find something to cut the cord. The thing is I was still in my boxers. I was in the middle of getting dressed when Vickiaposs waters broke. So it wasnapost asI just bent down and pulled the lace out of my shoes. The umbilical cord wasnapost long enough to pass Kayden to Vicki. She was just silent and I was scared I would see my son die in my arms.

He believes the pair didnapost meet at a bus stop in  as is widely told - and they concocted and rehearsed that story to hide the dark truth. Mr Goatley says he thinks that the couple actually met two years earlier, in a caravan less than a mile from the then -year-old Roseaposs house in Bishopaposs Cleeve, Glos.    Wayward teenagers would regularly visit Fredaposs caravan around that time and suggests it is likely that Rose would have known her future husband much earlier.

But after overcoming her addition with hard spirits Nicola replaced it with another - caloric food. Nicola, , from Larkfield, Kent, said: The first year was very hard, in fact it was hell on earth, but Iaposve been clean ever since. I moved back in with my parents and that was it - the next chapter in my le. But Nicolaaposs addictive urges were not completely cured, as she ed to comfort eating to feel better about herself. With junk meals from McDonalds and KFC becoming a staple of her diet, over just four years, between the age of  and , she saw her weight balloon to  stone.    Gorging on up to , calories on a good day, she said: Iaposd eat huge portions of food at home or scoff unhealthy takeaways, before snacking on bars and bars of chocolate. I could easily eat three bars of Green and Blacks in one sitting. She soon realised she had been battling an unhealthy relationship with food since she was about five-years-old. I swapped one addiction for another. I stopped drinking and started eating for Britain. It got worse and worse and worse until I found myself squeezing into a size . Iaposve had an addiction to food for as long as I can remember. Iaposd even go as far to call it an eating disorder. One of my earliest memories is of sneaking crisp packets up to my room and hiding them there.    I think I was trying to change the way I felt. I wasnapost a very happy girl and I wasnapost very happy for a lot of my le. Itaposs no oneaposs fault, itaposs just the way I think I was born.

I knew surgery was the only way for me to lose the weight, she explained. Iaposve tried all the fad diets and they just donapost work. I did see my doctor, but I wasnapost eligible for the procedure on the NHS, because I didnapost have any illnesses related to my weight. In a way Iaposm glad I ended up paying myself though, as it helped change my mindset. So, less than two months after her holiday, Nicola was booked in for a gastric bypass, which entails having the top part of the stomach joined to the small intestine, making people feel full more quickly. Borrowing £, from her parents for the procedure on July , , at the Streamline Surgical clinic, in Harrow, north west London, which she has subsequently repaid, Nicola recalled: I was discharged after two days and I wasnapost even in that much pain. I thinkyou want something that bad it helps you put all of that aside. Kept on a liquid diet of smoothies and soup for the first week, within a couple of months she saw the pounds flying off, losing seven stone in less than a year.  It really was amazing - the food addiction had been lted straight away, she added. Eating a more moderate , calories a day, by swapping junk food and chocolate for chicken salads and fresh fruit, it was not just Nicolaaposs diet that was transformed - she went from a couch potato to developing an impressive exercise regime, too. I knew I wanted to live a healthy lestyle and maintain the weight loss, so I started seeing a personal trainer once a week, she said.

After losing  stone and completely overhauling her le, in October last year, with the encouragement of her gym instructor, Nicola trained to be a qualied personal trainer and is now working part-time at her local gym. The fitness industry can be quite savage and I wanted to give people inspiration, she said.

Three American mothers and six gunmen from a Mormon community were ambushed by gang members. The victims, who belonged to the LeBaron family, were attacked roughly eight miles apart in the Mexican border state of Sonora on Monday while traveling in a convoy of three SUVs. Nine of the LeBaron family members, who have ties to Utah, were slaughtered in the massacre and one child was still missing.  On social media one family member said that gunmen opened fire on one child running away while others burned to death inside a car that was torched. Six children were wounded in the attack and five have since been transferred to hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona. Other young children managed to escape and hide by the roadside while one of the mothers was shot in the chest as she put her hands up to surrender. Relatives fear some of the victims may have been raped.    A boy managed to hide his wounded siblings in bushes while he ran to a nearby town to get help ater his mum was gunned down, according to one family member. The exact motive of the brutal killings on a dirt road between the Chihuahua and Sonora states is not clear. Some family members believe it was an attempted kidnapping. One relative said they received a phone call hearing screams before they were executed.  The relatives say her car had broken down when gunmen opened fire. They set her car ablaze which caused the petrol tank to explode. A video posted on social media showed the charred and smoking remains of the vehicle riddled with bullet holes. A male voice can be heard in the clip sayng: This is for the record. Nita and four of my grandchildren are burnt and shot up. Eight miles away in dferent attacks, several other family members were gunned down.  Christina Langford Johnson, , Dawna Ray Langford, , and two of Dawnaaposs children, Trevor, , and Rogan, , also died while traveling in two other SUVs. Family members say Christina saved her seven-month-old baby Faithaposs le by throwing the infant to the floor of their SUV as bullets tore through the vehicle.  Relatives say the baby had been in the back of the car all day before rescuers found her.   Seven of Dawnaaposs children survived but suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to relatives. Alex LeBaron, who says he lost family members in the attack, said three vehicles were targeted, taking the lives of three women, four small children and two infants.  Women and children were massacred, burnt alive. Mothers were screaming for the fire to stop, he said. We are a very tight-knit community, we share everything thataposs happening. “Weaposve been dealing with this tragedy since early yesterday. We share all information within our family groups.

One -year-old woman only found out she was pregnant when she went to hospital complaining of stomach pains. The other woman, a mother superior, was working with fallen women and their children when she discovered her own pregnancy. A Catholic church source in Rome told The Sun: There is consternation at this news.    It appears that both women were back in their home nations and obviously had some form of sexual encounter. “An investigation has been launched they both breached strict rules of chastity but the welfare of their children is uppermost. It is thought the women are likely to leave their religious work when their children are born.Earlier this year Pope Francis, who has million followers on Twitter , said that some nuns had been sexually abused by priests and bishops, even using them as sex slaves.He also acknowledged that sexual abuse of nuns was still taking place.

Seventeen members of the prominent Lebaron Mormon community were apparently travelling to a wedding in a convoy of SUVs when they were ambushed about  miles south of the US border. Local media said the family may have been mistaken for a rival cartel, while Donald Trump claimed the victims were caught in the crossfire of a gun battle and urged Mexico to wage war on the gangs. Mum Rhonita Maria LeBaron, , was slaughtered along with her six-month-old twin babies, Titus and Tiana, and two other children - Crystal, eight, and Howard,  - and the others were allegedly taken hostage eight miles up the road. Relatives feared Rhonita and her children were alive and trapped when their bullet-riddled SUV was allegedly set on fire and exploded. Another mum, Christina Johnson, , is said to have saved her seven-month-old baby girl, Faith, as she was shot dead.    The other three who died were named as mum Dawna Langford and two of her children - three-year-old Rogan and -year-old Trevor. Seven children who were in her car survived, including a teenage son who ran for miles to get help, a seven-year-old boy who was shot in the face, and a -month-old baby who was grazed by at least one bullet. One of the mums was shot at point-blank range in the chest when she got out of her car and put her hands up to surrender, and a nine-year-old girl that survived was shot in the back as she ran away, it is claimed. The victims - dual American-Mexican citizens with ties to Utah - belonged to the LeBaron family from a breakaway Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico decades ago.    The Mormons are well-known in the region and have had previous run-ins with criminals while speaking out about organised crime, but a member says there were no recent threats or warnings. Local media said the convoy could have been mistaken for that of a rival cartel. Relative and local anti-crime activist Julian LeBaron was left distraught after visiting the scene, just a few miles from the Mormon settlement, and seeing the charred bodies inside the burned-out SUV on Monday. He said the victims were innocent and were caught up in a war involving rival drug cartels, suggesting it was a case of mistaken identity. He told Milenio TV: This was a mistake. We do not know why.  They are innocent women and children.  They were going to see relatives. It is terrible. The massacre happened as the family members travelled in three SUVs from Bavispe, in the state of Sonora, to the Mormon community of LaBaron, in the neighbouring state of Chihuahua, it was reported. Some family members said the victims were on their way to a wedding, while Julian LeBaron told the New York Times that his cousin Rhonita was heading to Phoenix, Arizona, to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was ing home to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Rhonitaaposs car broke down and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car, he added.  He said one of the women got out of her car and put up her hands, but they shot her point blank in the chest. There were no recent threats against the family, he added. Grief-stricken relative Leah Staddon, who grew up in the Mormon community, said the three mothers and children were travelling in three vehicles to a wedding. She said her nephewaposs we, Rhonita, and four of the womanaposs children - twin babies Tiana and Titus, and older siblings Crystal and Howard - died when their vehicle was attacked. Ms Staddon, who lives in Queen Creek, Arizona, said her brother found the bullet-riddled vehicle still smouldering with the mum and childrenaposs charred bodies inside and he recorded video as evidence.  Ms Staddon said her sister-in-law Dawna Langford, , and cousin Christina Johnson , , were travelling in separate SUVs and were also killed. She told the Arizona Republic newspaper: Itaposs devastating. Itaposs incomprehensible, the evil. I don’t understand how someone could do that. Ms Langford was travelling in a second vehicle with nine children, she said. After gunmen killed Ms Langford and two of her kids - Trevor, , and Rogan, three - they opened a door and saw more children inside and let them go, said Ms Staddon. Ms Johnson was travelling in a third car with her seven-month-old daughter, Faith, who was found alive in the back of the vehicle.  The mum was hailed a hero in the aftermath, with family members saying she saved Faith, who was thrown on the floor. Ms Langfordaposs -year-old son hid the younger children - some of whom were wounded and bleeding - under a tree or in bushes and then ran about five miles to the familyaposs ranch to raise the alarm after his mum and some of his siblings were murdered, according to family. Ms Staddon pleaded for help from US authorities, writing in a Facebook post: They are doing all they can in Mexico and we need America’s help. Please help get the word out. We need to get them all back home safe also do not travel to Mexico!  The mafia over Sonora and the mafia over chihuahua are in all out war right now!!! US President Donald Trump said the victims were caught in the crossfire as warring drug cartels shot at each other. He said now is the time for Mexico and the US to wage war on cartels. He tweeted: A wonderful family and friends from Utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other, with the result being many great American people killed, including young children, and some missing. If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these..... ....monsters, the United States stands ready, willing  able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army! This is the time for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president! The FBI has opened an investigation, according to the family. The surviving children were taken to hospital. Family members posted photos showing an injured girl wearing blood-stained jeans, and injured boys in their hospital beds. Kenny LeBaron, a cousin of the mums who was killed, told the New York Times: “When you know there are babies tied in a car seat that are burning because of some twisted evil that’s in this world. It’s just hard to cope with that.” Heavily-armed soldiers and national police officers were deployed to secure the area and hunt for the gunmen. Initially, there were conflicting reports about the number of dead and the number of relatives who were abducted and missing.  El Universal, a national newspaper in Mexico, said  members of the family were killed in the attack, but family members and Mexican officials later said nine were dead. Julian LeBaron shared a post on Facebook identying one of the victims as Rhonita Maria LeBaron, also known as Rhonita Miller. The post said she died with her twin babies - a  boy and a girl - and two other children aged eight and . Family members said Ms Langford and Ms Johnson and their children were missing when the charred vehicle was discovered, but they were later found. Lafe Langford Jnr, another relative, wrote on Facebook: “It is with heavy hearts and unspeakable sadness we inform you that the  missing Mothers… along with many of their precious INNOCENT children have been slaughtered and gone to their Rest. “We need this to be shared and the whole world to witness the atrocious inhumane and barbaric acts that were committed against us today.  He told the Salt Lake Tribune that the victims got caught in the crossfire of two cartels. He said one of the mum called a relative, who heard a woman screaming and other loud male voices in the background, before she was killed. Relative Nefi LeBaron wrote: They were ambushed. All  families were driving together in a caravan through Northern Mexico. We assume that they got in a mafia cross fire. The families are thinking that the mafia mistook Rhonita’s vehicle for a rivals, then proceeded to attack. They eventually realized they killed an innocent family. To cover their tracks they burnt the vehicle with all of the passengers inside.

Ms Tang and her boyfriend were staying at a hotel in Jiangjin district of Chongqing, south-west China, in October when they realised a shadow moving outside their room door in the middle of the night.They alerted the police the next morning and officers reviewed the CCTV footage at the hotel to find a man crawling at the corridor, according to KuaiBao .Footage also captures the man taking his mobile phone out and placing it close to the door, seemingly to audio-record sounds coming from the room.    He checks his phone before moving to the next room. Shuangfu Police traced the footage and arrested a -year-old man, known by the surname He, on suspicion of invasion of privacy last Tuesday.    Mr He, from Xishui, Guizhou province, claimed he stayed a night at the same hotel and heard his neighbour romping in the room next door.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”A string of wins has seen Dundee rise to third in the table, behind Morton and league leaders United."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/KCes_Flooding_Aftermath_Ravensby_Road_Carnoustie_05.11.19-12.jpg ","title":"drying out today but more weather misery on the way for tayside","story":"Drier and calmer conditions are expected today after Tayside endured a day of severe rain, wind and flooding.However the wet weather is expected tolater in the week which could lead to a repeat of yesterday’s downpours.The deluge caused major disruption for motorists, with the A between Ethiebeaton and Arbroath closed after large sections of the surface became submerged in water.One reader shared a video with the Tele showing motorists struggling to negotiate the road near the Carnoustie junction.The driver said that a number of motorists had become stuck in the water, adding that he had been forced to use a high gear to make his way through the flood.Another motorist said on Facebook: “We passed it about an hour ago and the water was up to the car bonnets.”The road was soon closed and remained shut overnight with traffic erted through Monieth.The route was reopened this morning ensuring morning commuters didn’t face further disruption. vw, px\"  Ravensby Road in Carnoustie was also closed due to flooding.High winds forced the closure of the Tay Road Bridge to double-decker buses, while a speed restriction of mph was also imposed on other traffic crossing the bridge.Following the Met Office lting its yellow weather warning, forecasters have said rainfall will largely be confined to coastal areas today.However the Scottish Environmental Protection Agencyhas a flood alert still in place for Dundee and Angus after river levels rose due to the prolonged periods of heavy rain.Frost and fog is expected to come in overnight with temperatures dropping to -C. vw, px\"  Widespread showers are predicted totomorrow in the late afternoon, with temperatures at about C.On Thursday there will be downpours throughout the day with heavy winds also expected alongside colder temperatures.However, conditions are forecast to improve on Friday with sunny spells and light winds for much of the day.The weather is expected to worsen again on Saturday with showers ing.A spokeswoman said: “The weather will get better, however it will still be very cloudy and cold.“It should improve throughout the week.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072235-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072235-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072235-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48072235-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united sell out of tickets for fridays derby","story":"Dundee United have sold out their ticket allocation for Friday#s derby at Dens Park.The Tangerines are currently sitting at the top of the Championship after Saturday’s win at Inverness.Tickets are still available for the Hegarty Suite event, priced at £ per person.There are also a few places available at hospitality still, priced at £ per person."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/19144368-1-859x564.jpg ","title":"forster aiming to keep momentum going as morton check in at dens","story":"Jordon Forster says Dundee showed both sides of their game in two away wins this week and wants to see the Dark Blues carry on that momentum tonight at home to Morton.The Dens men host their Greenock opponents aiming to move level with second-placed Ayr United before the rest of the ision play tomorrow.And Forster saysthey play like they did in back-to-back victories over the Honest Men and Alloa in the past seven days, they’ll set themselves up for the derby at home to Dundee United next week.He told the Tele: “It’s been a good week so far.“We set ourselves a challenge of three wins in a week and we are on track to achieve that.“So far it’s been good but another three points tonight will make it a really good week.“We have a big game next week but first and foremost it’s about Morton tonight to set us up nicely.”He added: “We had two hard away games over the past week and it was nice to come away with six points by battling hard in one and getting a clean sheet in the other.“In previous games we have played well in large spells and dominated games for - minutes but let teams back into games like the Partick game where we conceded three late goals.“There were question marks over whether we could hold onto a lead and I think we proved we can last Friday night at Ayr.“We shut the back door and battled to victory on a cold night down there.“Then Tuesday against an Alloa side that have proved they can play and beat teams, we put in our most complete performance of the season.“We scored three goals, kept a clean sheet and dominated the majority of the game.“We’ll look to take both sides of those two games into the match tonight.”There is also the chance to put right the - defeat suffered at Cappielow five weeks ago where Forster feels the Dark Blues let a result slip through their grip.The big centre-back reckons the squad has come a long way since then but knows Dundee must be wary of David Hopkin’s men.He added: “If you look at the last game you can see we limited Morton to very few chances and they scored from a set-piece.“They are a big strong team so credit to them for that because they must work on set-pieces and they put the ball in the box at every opportunity.“That’s their style and it worked that day. But I think we had more than enough chances to win the game comfortably.“Since then we have been a lot more clinical so we’re looking forward to tonight and we’re confident we will come away with three points.”Playing tonight also gives Dundee the chance to get a headstart on their rivals at the top end of the Championship table.Three points would put them above Inverness ahead of Caley Thistle’s home match with Dundee United and level with Ayr.With top and third playing each other it is a chance to make up some ground on at least one of them but onlythey can pick up the victory.Forster added: “It can be a good thing and a bad thing playing first, depending on which side of the fence you are looking from. For us, we are looking to go and win the game, get three points and try to put a bit of pressure on the other teams who are playing tomorrow.“We obviously had the game on Tuesday but we’ve recovered well and worked a bit on what we are planning to do on the pitch tonight through the week.“We are looking forward to it, we have a bit of momentum and we are looking to try to keep that going.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.47621431-240x180.jpg

before an accident at work changed his le in .Fast-forward four years – and the former road worker contemplates taking his own le every single day.A visibly distressed Scott today revealed he has dealt with a tumultuous few years that have transformed his le.The death of his sister Jennie Cameron was among a number of family losses in a short period of time.Her brave battle against cancer was documented in the Eveningbefore she died on the day she was due to be married in September .Scott was admitted to Carseview the following month after attempting to take his own le.Now the former St Saviour’s High pupil is urging for greater aftercare support for those struggling with mental health issues.He said: “Since I had an accident at work it has sort of spiralled from there.“From being a man who used to work to support his family to being like this is incredibly hard to take.“I was in Carseview on two separate occasions the month that I attempted to take my own le.“I still have suicidal thoughts daily.”His fiancée, Cheryl, had to become his carer as the family attempted to rebuild their le in Brechin.An unfortunate brush with the law had seen Scott appear in court earlier this year.The police found a haul of antique knives in his car on Fairbairn Street.Dundee Sherf Court heard Scott was encouraged to start collecting knives by his mental health nurses when he was staying at the Carseview Centre.Scott added: “I had just bought the antique knives that day.“It was a case of wrong place, wrong time, after dropping off a family friend.“That pending court case didn’t help with my on-going issues.”Scott had hoped with the support of the community mental health team he could get his le back on track in Angus.He admitted a lack of regular support had seen his progress “stall”.He added: “Whether its a lack of funding or overworked staff, I believe there are failings in the system.“I know of others who are in a similar position to me who feel they can’t get the help they need.“There are massive gaps in the system.”Scott said he wanted to tell his story so that people could be more aware that mental health issues “don’t just go away”.He added: “Despite leaving Carseview my mental health issues didn’t stop the day I left that door.“It is an ongoing struggle and you need those support measures in place.“I want to get the help to turn this around.“Although we have things like Mental Health Awareness Week I believe there is still a lack of understanding of the struggles people face.”A spokeswoman for Angus Health and Social Care Partnership said, “Multidisciplinary community mental health teams are available in every town in Angus.These teams include nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists and allied health professionals.“Community Mental Health Teams also commission third sector services to deliver care in the home and the community

months in fridays dundee derby","story":"Dundee United centre-back Mark Connolly could be in line for his first start in over two months in Friday’s derby at Dens Park.However, the -year-old will have his work cut out to displace the backline that defended so solidly in Saturday’s - win at Inverness .At the weekend, Connolly made histo first-team duties from the bench since tearing his hamstring in the last derby, a - win over rivals Dundee, on August .And boss Robbie Neilson says he could be ready for a starting spot at Dens on Friday.He said: “Mark has a reserve game tomorrow but we felt it was a good opportunity with a few minutes to go to get him out there and get him some first-team game time.“If he comes back in again, he’s had that bit of a test on his hamstring.“He’s trained magnicently and I think he’s in the best condition I’ve ever seen him, even when he was a kid at Kilmarnock. He’s really looking after himself and has been a great example to everyone so we just wanted to get him back on the pitch.”Goals from strikers Nicky Clark and Lawrence Shankland added to a first-half own goal by Caley Thistle defender Shaun Rooney as United racked up an impressive - victory in the Highlands.The goalscorers may get the plaudits but the Tannadice gaffer was delighted with the work done by his backline, giving Connolly some work to do to earn back his starting spot.Robbie added: “When you go to a place like Inverness, the backline is the most important thing for you.“Inverness put the ball up to Jordan White right on top of your back four and it can be easy to drop off. But I thought our two centre-backs and full-backs kept the game nice and tight which allowed us to get pressure on the midfield. That allowed us to push on.”Caley Thistle boss John Robertson felt Shankland could have been red-carded in the first half for an elbow on Jamie McCart.He said: “The assistant is standing  yards away and should have seen a clear elbow. It’s a tangle and maybe Lawrence is trying to free himself but, accidental or not, he has caught him with his elbow.”Robbie said: “Shanks has just tried to barge him back out of the way. The linesman was  yards away and the ref  yards away. The swarming of the referee blows everything out of proportion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"tell-us-old-steamie-memories-win-tickets-classic-show","story":"GLASGOWS old steamies prompt many a memory for those, like Mary McCusker, who remember when they were found in all of the city neighbourhoods."},{"url":null,"title":"notre-dames-pupils-speak-keep-us-unique-keep-us-all-girls","story":"PUPILS from Notre Dame High School will hold a peaceful protest outside Glasgow City Chambers to tell councillors to \"Keep us all-girls\"."},{"url":null,"title":"new-cap-agreed-glasgow-primary-secondary-school-intake","story":"THE MAXIMUM intake for primary and secondary pupils in Glasgow schools will be amended in line with the catchment area for each school next year."},{"url":null,"title":"first-glasgow-offering-free-bus-travel-armed-forces-veterans-remembrance-sunday","story":"First Bus is to provide free travel toall armed forces personnel, veterans and cadets travelling to Remembrance Sunday events across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"generous-glasgow-girl-8-gives-birthday-fundraise-disability-charity","story":"A generousyoung Glasgow girl is planning to celebrate her birthday with a twist ndash by raising money for a charity that has supports her disabled cousin."},{"url":null,"title":"thief-forcibly-drags-girl-15-seat-carjacking","story":"A THIEF forcibly dragged a teenage girl from a passenger seat during a broad-daylight carjacking."},{"url":null,"title":"marks-spencer-hiring-christmas-staff-glasgow---apply","story":"Marks  Spencer are on the lookout for  seasonal staff in Glasgow to help get busy families ready for the festive season."},{"url":null,"title":"south-lanarkshire-council-leader-apologises-ram-yer-union-yer-hoop-tweet","story":"A Scottish council leader has been slammed for a controversial tweet featuring a banner with the message ldquoRam yer union up yer hoop."},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/19303383.jpg ","title":"main aims for lethal strike duo alongside cosgrove","story":"Buoyed by his first competitive Aberdeen goal, Curtis Main is confident he can forge a lethal strike partnership with Sam Cosgrove.Summer signing Main admits to frustration at both his lack of goaland game time since moving to Pittodrie.Chances have been limited and he was also hit by setbacks such as the dismissal last month against Hibs which he maintains was not a red card.Aberdeen opted not to appeal that sending-off and any momentum Main hoped to build was subsequently derailed by a two-game ban.However, the -year-old was given another opportunity when pitched in alongside prolic striker Cosgrove in a -- against Kilmarnock.It paid off as Main ended his competitive scoring drought and Cosgrove hit his th goal of the season.Main reckons they can become a dangerous duo in attack.He said: “I have no doubt Sam and myself can play together.“We showed against Kilmarnock there were spells in the game when we linked up really well.“I think everyone will be pleased with how we played attacking wise.“It is nice to play up there with another striker and you can build a relationship and work off each other’s game.“We are both imposing players but both link up well on the floor. It is not just one-dimensional.”His goalscoring performance against Kilmarnock was only the fourth start for the former Motherwell striker this season.Dons boss Derek McInnes has understandably opted to primarily use prolic striker Cosgrove to lead his attack.Cosgrove scored  times last season and is already closing in on that landmark again.Main said: “Absolutely, I have been frustrated. I just want to be on the park, playing minutes and scoring goals.“That is what I came here to do.“Behind the scenes I am working as hard as possible every day to put myself in a good position so that when the opportunities do come I am able to take them.“I have just had to keep my head down, work hard and wait for opportunities.“A few weeks ago I felt good in that gamebut unfortunately that didn’t go to plan.“I had to stay patient, stay ready and stay fit.“I am more than confident in my own ability. It is just about being on the park and showing everyone what I can do.”Main admits he has had discussions with manager McInnes about his lack of game time since signing on at Pittodrie.He said: “The manager is open and honest and I have had conversations with him through the season so far.“It is a competitive squad and it is about putting myself in a position to be in the squad and be in the team.”McInnes handed Main the opportunity to impress in the - draw with Hibs in his last appearance for the Dons on October .His strong performance was derailed when referee Don Robertson handed Main a straight red for a challenge on Stevie Mallan in the th minute.Main was shocked by the decision then and the red still rankles.He said: “It was disbelief. Absolute disbelief. I still maintain it was a good tackle. I think the boy made way too much of it.“I might have grazed his foot but there were a couple of incidents in the game where he was rolling round, which is totally unnecessary.“Unfortunately that is sometimes the way the game is played.“It was disheartening because I was in the team and had an opportunity. I felt I was playing well but I just had to forget it, put it to the back of my mind and wait for the next opportunity.“Thankfully that has come around very quickly and I managed to do something with it.”Main netted in the - pre-season friendly draw with Inverness Caley Thistle in July as part of the build-up to the Europa League campaign.He was delighted to finally score in a competitive match for Aberdeen and hopes it will be a catalyst for many more.He said: “ It was overdue and I am pleased that I have that goal.“Now I just have to move on and try to build on that.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/SNS-19607994-Aberdeen-v-Kilmarnock.jpg ","title":"mcinnes hails dons for bouncing back","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes today praised his under-pressure squad for bouncing back from their Celtic humiliation.The Reds were slaughtered by supporters and critics for the recent - loss where all Celtic’s goals came in the first half.McInnes demanded an immediate reaction and set a target of maximum points from the remaining three games before the international break.Aberdeen have delivered six with back-to-back wins against Hamilton and Kilmarnock.They travel to Ross County on Saturday before the Premiership goes into a week’s shutdown for the Euro  qualiers.McInnes said: “There was a bit of scrutiny on us after Celtic and I think the players have done extremely well to win both games with both clean sheets.“It is just a start for us and hopefully we can go on and get a third win in a row against Ross County next week. And go into the international break feeling a bit better about ourselves.”McInnes opted to partner strikers Sam Cosgrove and Curtis Main in a -- system against a Kilmarnock side struggling to field recognised centre-backs due to injury and suspension.It paid off with Main netting his first competitive goal for the Dons since his summer move.Cosgrove also scored to take his tally for the season to  goals.McInnes believes the score-line should have been more emphatic as Aberdeen were denied a penalty claim by referee Kevin Clancy.Cosgrove was brought down by a clumsy tackle from Stephen Hendrie in the box in the second half but the whistler waved play on.McInnes said: “We should have had a penalty with Cosgrove in the second half when he got wiped out in the bottom corner.“We also hit the post so it was good to get the third goal to add a bit of polish to the result.“Kilmarnock don’t normally lose too many goals so I am pleased with that scoreline against them.”The international break will give McInnes and his first-team squad the time to move into the new £ million training facility at Kingsford.Although the youth academy officially moved into Cormack Park yesterday, the first team squad have delayed it.Following the official opening by Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday, they used the facilities for the first time the following day.McInnes said: “Cormack Park is a huge step forward for the club. It is brilliant facility for us all to enjoy.“We trained there on Friday with the team and it was the first chance the players had really got to see it.“We will train there again on Friday because we are not moving in full-time yet.“The academy kids and coaches started there on Monday and we will move in the following week.”Cormack Park is phase one of a £m plus development at Kingsford with phase two the delivery of a ,-capacity stadium.That was initially scheduled to be opened in summer  but that date is likely to be moved back a year until summer .McInnes said: “The players getting that first sense of Cormack Park and enjoying our own environment is fantastic for the professional side of the club.“However, it is great for the whole region. For the development of our players and coaches it is going to be a godsend.“It is what we should have had as we have been way behind other clubs in facilities.“Now we have a facility to be rightly proud of.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/5dc11ec7dce7f8.71124333-131x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inclusive basketball session to take place in aberdeen","story":"An inclusive basketball festival for young people is scheduled to take place in Aberdeen this week.Premium club and registered charity Grampian Flyers will host the event, which is aimed at both primary and secondary school pupils, on Friday.It introduces youngsters to both running and wheelchair basketball and is inclusive for pupils in schools with physical, sensory or intellectual impairments.They will have the opportunity to try out a range of dferent basketball drills, friendly competitive matches, inclusive zone basketball and take part in the sport for wheelchair users.It runs from am until noon at the Beach Leisure Centre in Aberdeen on Friday.For more information on the event, and to register a school to take part, contact kirsty.smith@gmail"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48123097-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48123097-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48123097-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48123097-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east nursery praised by inspectors0511","story":"A north-east nursery has been praised by inspectors.The Care Inspectorate visited the Magic Roundabout Childcare Centre in Elgin on September .The facility’s quality of care and environment were both rated as “very good” following the unannounced inspection."},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5db7e86fa27226.39970583-383x564.jpg ","title":"costume drama for halloween","story":"Masks and costumes have been worn to festivals and masquerade balls for centuries.Nowadays, Halloween is the most popular fancy-dress event of the year.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

forward include allowing the countyrsquos schools to switch their scheduled May holiday from May  to May  and either ldquolook sympathetically on any requests from non-school staff who want to take the day off to mark the occasion or move the September bank holiday to May  for other workers.The option of changing the school holiday would benefit the council as the Scottish Qualications Authority has scheduled exams for May  next year, which would mean some staff having to work that day.But while those options have been supported by teaching union the EIS, Unison has said it prefers another option which would see the date given as an additional holiday.A report due to be considered by councillors next week warns that adding an extra dayrsquos holiday could cost up to pound, in additional

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh. However, at this time we have not been invited to join any group."},{"url":null,"title":"80-year-old-port-seton-pensioner-admits-breaching-asbo","story":"Thomas Hamilton, , broke the rules of the ASBO imposed in April which had barred him from using aggressive, abusive or intimidating language or causing distress to neighbours at his Long Craigs home.He breached the order on August  when he was found to have used abusive language during an incident where he obstructed a parking bay during an argument with a neighbour.Hamilton also damaged a vehicle during the row near to his home.The OAP also assaulted neighbour Ian Hirst by struggling with him during a separate incident at Long Craigs on August .The pensioner was back in the dock at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to the two offences.Sherf John Cook was told that Hamilton had a review of a previous case with another sherf in March next year and he was content to defer all matters to that date.No narration of the August events were read out in court and all matters were deferred to March .Hamilton admitted breaching his ASBO on August .

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though itrsquos not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thatrsquos only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labourrsquos policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage and retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  target reduced to % net zero.In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonrsquosand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Corbyn wants to reintroduce the customs union and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also wants close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure.But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnrsquot be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workersrsquo rights and environmental standards, and got it through Parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labourrsquos government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnrsquot know it to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsonrsquos deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the General Election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbynrsquos enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as anti-Semitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit.The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn possess it "},{"url":null,"title":"70-000-trees-take-root-scottish-schools","story":"East Lothian nursery Alba Trees, is providing a range of packs to suit dferent needs on behalf of the Woodland Trust on a first come first served basis to any groups that will use them to help green public spaces.Nearly , schools and other groups will receive , saplings this month, thanks to the initiative which is funded by Sainsburyrsquos, Peoplersquos Postcode Lottery, Yorkshire Tea and Selfridges.In Scotland alone, , trees are being sent out to  dferent organisations.Woodland Trust Scotland Director Carol Evans said tree planting had never been higher on the social and political agenda, amid increasing public awareness that we are in a climate crisis.ldquoPeople are waking up to the message that trees are a big part of the solution to tackling climate change, she said.ldquoWe need more of them so it is fantastic that we are able to provide these free trees for schools and communities across the country.Woodland Trustsrsquos Big Climate Fightback aims to get more than a million people to pledge to plant a tree on the run up to a mass day of planting across the UK on November .ldquoReducing our carbon emissions will never be enough.

Bruce also appeared to confuse Vote Leave with the Leave.EU campaign.The young woman defended her position, but was told by Bruce ldquono criminal charges were brought.The right-wing journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was a list, then jumped in to say: ldquoThe vast majority of allegations about both Leave campaigns were found to be completely untrue. This was propaganda.The audience member was correct, however ndash Vote Leave broke the law. Yet, any viewer would have left the programme believing the opposite.This is a critical failure by the BBC. The national broadcaster is meant to provide unbiased, accurate reporting. It did the opposite on Question Time.This General Election is one that will be fought on lies, deceit and manipulation. Thatrsquos why facts, truth and trust are the most vital issues for the electorate.Herersquos a reminder of what the BBC should have told viewers. Vote Leave was fined pound, for breaking electoral law over spending limits. In March this year, it dropped its appeal against the fine. Vote Leave was fronted by Boris Johnson. Cummings was campaign director.The Electoral Commission said: ldquoSerious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital, therefore, that they are properly investigated and sanctioned.A day after Question Time aired, it emerged evidence relating to overspending, which could lead to criminal charges against Vote Leave, had been passed by police to the Crown Prosecution Service.The House of Commonrsquos Privileges Committee said Cummings had committed a contempt of Parliament by not appearing to give evidence when ordered as part of an inquiry into fake news.The fact that Question Time acted as a distributor for lies on an issue which is right at the very heart of Brexit and the forthcoming General Election makes the broadcasterrsquos failings ever more egregious.I donrsquot see bias at every turn with the BBC. Irsquove mostly great respect for the broadcaster in terms of its journalism and also its cultural output. When I see it attacked by both right and left, Leave and Remain, unionists and Yes voters, Irsquom pretty confident itrsquos doing its job and holding all sides of the political spectrum to account. Demonstrations against the BBC and hate campaigns against reporters run contrary to every democratic bone in my body. I see them as the first steps on the path to authoritarianism and populism.However, the BBC as a whole suffers from a fatal weakness: its automatic default position is to defend the status quo. When authority speaks, it accepts and parrots, it doesnrsquot question and interrogate. Radical voices are subjected to withering scrutiny, reactionary voices are treated with respect and dignity. This skews debate and immediately sets up imbalance.We saw the same problem here in Scotland during the independence referendum. The knee-jerk position was to subject the Yes campaign to forensic investigation, while broadly accepting most of what the No campaign said on face value. Both sides should have been put under the same pressure.There are also flaws built in to Question Time, which are now becoming damaging to democracy.

It shouldnrsquot be amplying hoods. Perhaps, one starting solution would be to change the format of Question Time by adding in a fact-checker service. While the  debate, a team of journalists could sit behind them double-checkingwhat they are saying is true. If they lie, fact-checkers should interrupt the show and tell viewers the truth.

Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: ldquoFood safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland ndash which wants to maintain alignment with the EU ndash and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.ldquoNegotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.ldquoIf one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.ldquoThis raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.The report also suggests EU safeguards on food standards will be weakened as soon as the UK leaves, with the Government planning to scrap the requirement for independent scientic assessments on the safety of pesticides and allowing minister to lower thresholds for labelling when genetically-modied crops are used.Professor Erik Millstone, emeritus professor in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, said: ldquoOur analysis suggests Brexit SIs will allow ministers to exercise considerable powers of discretion when authorising ingredients in pesticide products, amending GMO authorisations and thresholds for labelling, authorising food additives and approving substances for animal carcass washes.ldquoMinisters may issue guidance impacting substantive policy content or make new rules governing food safety by secondary legislation, without proper parliamentary scrutiny and using powers that exceed those vested by the EU in the European Commission.ldquoThose considerable powers could be a way to overcoming parliamentary resistance and public opposition to aspects of a UK-US trade deal.Recommending that devolved nations have ldquostrong oversight over UK external trade negotiations, the study also calls for primary legislation to be required where there could be major policy changes on food safety."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-working-post-office-dumfries-galloway-goes-sale","story":"Sanquhar Post Office

appropriated by mindful Millennials , then Flora Shedden is arguably a standard-bearer of the generations she spans. Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

Music, the sound psychology of emotion and feeling##.what can be stronger Bobis Johnson is music to the country#s ears.David,you areabsolutely correct. To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief. Was it #Arty subjects# you taught perchance  It is#bizarre and idiotic# to use battery cars when your power source is diesel generated. You actually increase your carbon footprint! Simples. Now ask any well-educated youngster and they will explain the science to you.#Simples# Well that is a scientic proof Popper would have been proud of!I think the personal attacks on Peter and his educationonly make your point stronger.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191028_101405.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":null,"title":"book of condolence for gay byrne opens in dublin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for Void gallery said: Jarman’s apocalyptic, postcolonial depictions of the ‘fall of England’ - reflecting the country’s desire toto its ‘Imperial days’ - are ever present in the current political landscape, from Brexit, parliamentary suspensions and the absence of a government at Stormont, to the rise of nationalism, fascism and state surveillance. We are at an impasse in Northern Ireland and are once again at the mercy of Westminster decision-making. googletag.cmd.push The film references the AIDS epidemic and the collective trauma that was experienced at that time. It was originally going to be titledGBH The Last Of England,reflecting the destruction of the landscape and culture of England, and more personally the body through AIDS. Jarman said the GBH could stand for “whatever you want it to: grievous bodily harm, great British horror, gargantuan bloody H-bomb”. Instead, he used the GBH title for his painting series, depicting the map of England in ious stages of being inflamed.In exhibiting these works,it punctuates this particular moment in Britians political history, to show the parallels in the political struggle from then and now. The legacy of Jarman’s work and gay rights activists both past and present are demonstrated in recent societal and legislative changes with the legalisation of gay marriage in the North.

He set up the #lovemakesaway movement and the First Home Project.Cathleen Falsani is a writer who has just released an acclaimed new book End Of Hunger. In the past she has interviewed the likes of Barack Obama and Bono.Jonny Clark is the producer of s Of The Flame and is the leader of Youth With A Mission in Ireland and runs a Reconciliation centre in Rostrevor, County Down called An Cuan.Jonny, Jarrod and Cathleen have been walking the Border since the supposed Brexit Day of st October to be a presence of peace and reconciliation in the communities along the route.Also speaking at the Bellaghy event will be Eugene Reavey.Two of Eugene’s brothers, John Martin , Brianwere shot dead by UVF gunmen who burst into their Co Armagh home on  January .His brother Anthonywas also shot and died later in hospital. The UVF also shot  members of another Catholic family on the same night. Elements in the security forces claimed the Reaveys were an IRA family – the Historical Enquiries Team later apologised to Mrs Reavey for this  allegation. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under a ‘totting-up’ system, a driver who accumulates  or more penalty points within a three year period is liable to be disqualied from driving for six months. If they are disqualied a second time, they cannot drive for a year.However, the Driver and Vehicle Agency say that it “does not have the power to disqualy a person from driving” and that “a disqualication can only be ordered by the court.” This means that motorists can remain on the road despite having a large number of penalty points.In response to an Freedom of Informationrequest from the County Derry Post, the Driver and Vehicle Agencyrevealed that ten drivers in the county have  penalty points on their licence, one motorist have  and two drivers have  points. The DVA has not revealedall  drivers have been disqualied. Recent figures have shown that more than , motorists in the UK continue to drive with  or more penalty points. This includes a -year-old Burnley woman who has  points on her licence, a -year-old Kent man with  points and a Bradford manwho has the worst record in the UK with  penalty points. Road safety charity IAM RoadSmart says that it has been calling for the government to take action on this issue for six years and is “highly concerned” at the number of motorists that remain on the road with so many penalty points.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart director of policy and research, said that action must be taken “to get irresponsible and dangerous drivers off our roads.” “Licences need to be removed and drivers who have committed repeat offences encouraged to take remedial courses to bring home the impact of the impact of their behaviour and promote safer, more responsible driving behaviour in future,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since  a no show Sinn Fein MP has held the seat, rendering the Foyle constituency voiceless. The SDLP now appear to be endorsing abstentionism and are falling-in behind Sinn Fein. “At this election, I am standing to seek a mandate for genuine representation at Westminster and continued delivery for the Foyle constituency.

Funding was also secured for sure start and Literacy and Numeracy projects. “The Foyle constituency will also benefit signicantly from the pound million ultra-fast broadband rollout, bringing connectivity to some of our most rural and isolated areas. “This was all achieved through the DUP Confidence and Supply agreement and whilst the Sinn Fein MP for this constituency stood on the sidelines delivering nothing.

I have served for almost a decade as an elected representative for Foyle assisting my constituents at every level with their issues.” Mr Middleton concluded: “For a strong Pro Union, Pro Le and Pro Foyle candidate, vote Middleton on th December.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The spokesperson added: “Shaun has a proven track record of standing up for ordinary people and wont let you down.” Cllr Harkin said every vote for People Before Profit is a vote for a socialist Ireland, for an alternative to unionism and nationalism and for an end to “elitist Westminster rule. He added: The Tories have ruled the roost for the last decade with contempt for ordinary people. The DUP shamefully propped them up to continue the attack on public services, welfare, workers rights, the environment and threaten a hard border. googletag.cmd.push “Boris Johnson embodies Westminsters failed democracy and the elitism of the rich and powerful. He needs to go. We want to bring Tory DUP rule to an end for good. “People Before Profit can be trusted to vote to scrap welfare reform, undo anti-trade union laws, reverse privatisation of public services and resist any attempt to reimpose a hard border here. !Well vote to increase taxes on billionaires. Well vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. “They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUPs effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. “Establishment parties here cant be trusted to end Tory rule. They cant be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They cant be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. Cllr Harkin concluded: “On December  Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.” Councillor Harkin contested the constituency at the last General Election in  and polled , votes. His selection brings to three the total of confirmed candidates for the Foyle constituency, joining sitting MP Elisha McCallion and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn. Also Lady Pym who was representing the local senior citizensrsquo Friendship Club.BALLYGALGET mdash A request from the school management committee of St Patrickrsquos Primary School at Ballygalget to provide transport for  pupils has been turned down by the local Education Board.The school management committee had explained to the Board that the  infants end their school day officially at .pm, but there is no transport to take them home until .pm.The school committee requested action because there was no teacher available to supervise the infants who had to remain in the school building.The transport officer of the Board, Mr Milligan, stressed that seven of the children were below compulsory school attendance age and as such were not eligible for school transport.Outlining the background to transport facilities provided at the school, Mr Milligan pointed out that an Ulsterbus had carried the children to and from the school for over  years.It had not generally been the practice of the Board to provide buses to take the children home before the end of the normal school day and there were no Board vehicles free to provide transport.Despite a y debate, the Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee said they could not suggest a solution to the problem.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick priest Dr Joseph Maguire has been re-elected chairman of the finance committee of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Maguire told members of the committee that he considered it an hour to be re-elected and he promised to serve the interests of the committee and the Board in every way that he could.COMBER mdash Proposals by Comber traders to prevent moves which they say could threaten their businesses, may well be turned down.The threat is in the shape of the Department of Environment who have announced that they intend introducing parking restrictions in the main shopping areas of the town.The confrontation between the Department and Comber Traders Association has been long running, but on Thursday it seemed that a solution could be found.The Traders Association had an on-the-spot meeting on Thursday morning with a representative from the Roads Division, who listened to the tradersrsquo complaints and suggestions for the siting of the yellow lines in the town. Also present was a representative from the RUC traffic branch.However, there are fears that the tradersrsquo suggestions will be dismissed and the Department will push ahead with their proposals to restrict parking in Comber.The Traders Association feel that the proposals are a very real threat to their livelihood and are inconvenient mdash a view shared by many residents in the town who have backed the Association in their fight with the Department..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Greenkeeper.jpg","title":"Greenkeeper gets revenge at sunny Spa  ","story":"SPA golfers faced a novel end-of-season challenge on Saturday when head groundsman Lee Cartmill set up the -hole course for his Greenkeeperrsquos Revenge competition.It was essentially a fun event which attracted a large number of both ladies and gents and proved to be so popular it is likely to feature again on the Spa calendar.But the devilishly dficult pin placings did not deter Alan Carson who topped the leaderboard with a magnicent score of  points while Catherine McEvoy won the ladies -hole competition with  points.Spa PGA professional Gary Wardlow warned competitors that the pins were in ldquorather unusual positions but after a number of impressive scores were ed he reckoned it had not been sufficiently challenging.Stuart Alexander had his best start for many months with eight straight pars followed by a birdie at the par four th, but unfortunately his great run did not continue.At least two other competitors mdash Sam Boyd and William McAnally mdash also had birdies at the th where the pin was placed in the left-hand green side bunker.Menrsquos results: st Alan Carson , nd George Wilson , rd Chris Chittick , th Stephen Adams , th Brian Graham .Ladiesrsquo results: st Catherine McEvoy , nd Vivienne Abernethy , rd Carol Shields ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Hat-trick.jpg","title":"Hat trick of titles  ","story":"IT was a case of trebles all round recently for a highly-talented teenager from Kilmore.Eighteen year-old Conor Mullan, a son of well-known Crossgar garage owner James Mullan, was in seventh heaven after adding the Ulstermotocross semi-expert title to the Irish and Ulster Youth crowns won earlier in the the year.Conor blazed his way to victory in all three competitions and crowned a sensational year at Desertmartin last week when he clinched the Ulster title, despite riding with a few niggling injuries, including a troublesome shoulder.To clinch Ulster and Irish titles in the same year is some achievement and Conor has done it in style.The Year  pupil at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, now has his focus on sitting his A-Levels next year ldquoI am in Upper Sixth at the minute, taking A-Levels in geography, technology and business studies, he said.ldquoNext year the plan is to go to university, where Irsquod like to study business, or economics.

Together, we want to deliver inclusive, transformative regional regeneration, strengthen our economy and boost our prosperity.Ambitious plans to revolutionise tourist facilities in Newcastle are part

the project.An economist is also to be appointed to help with the delivery of the business case which is expected to be completed in early spring or summer.The Gateway proposal is one of the key projects included in the local councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.The world class tourist attraction proposals include the gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain with the proposals expected to be delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the ious projects through a series of key

would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days old.ldquoThe torture wasnrsquot that he had CF, it was that there was something that could help him but there was a company out there that was pricing the drug so highly, it was unobtainable.Jen

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of . Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything. Declan, of course, wanted to tell the world but we didnrsquot want to say until Mark knew for definite it was  per cent.ldquoWe are hoping to travel over for his first show as this will be a great stepping stone for him.While the opportunity may have alluded the talented  year-old until now, Mark said he is ready for the challenge.ldquoIrsquom not nervous about performing as Irsquom definitely ready for this but Irsquom a bit nervous about the other performers who have played the role and feel an obligation to be good and do everyone proud.Mark has already appeared in a youth production of Joseph as the Pharaoh, having performed with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society from the age of  to .He said that while he grew up in a musical family, it was his grandfather, Seamus Mullan, and mother, Brenda, who really encouraged him.ldquoI knew I could sing from an early age as Irsquom from a musical family, said Mark. ldquoBut it wasnrsquot really until I joined the choral society and sang publicly for the first time a few months later in Calamity Jane that people began to tell me I was really good.ldquoPeople told me that I could make a career of singing and it began to occur to me that maybe I could do this.ldquoMy granda was a member of St Patrickrsquos Choral Society and sang in the choir of Mary Mother of the Church in Saintfield. The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

It will be followed by a QA with the producer and live performances.Across the four day festival audiences will have the chance to hear Northern Ireland’s finest talent, including over  of the  Music Prize nominees, in unique, intimate venues.

Although Alliance may not win seats in December, it may be the biggest long-term winner from the new political landscape.IRA and INLA left out of paramilitary ’s report Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance has already been growing rapidly in recent years and made a signicant breakthrough earlier this year when for the first time its leader Noami Long took one of the two unionist MEP seats in an election which saw Northern Ireland elect one unionist, one nationalist and one who is constitutionally unaligned.SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon defended her party’s decision to stand aside in favour of Sinn Fein.She said: “This election is all about stopping Brexit and stopping Boris. It’s about Leave versus Remain. We have taken a very dficult and uncomfortable decision but a very pragmatic one in this election because we need to elect as many Remain MPs as possible who are going to take their seats and vote against Brexit.“But the reality is that we need to also do what we can to remove the very toxic influence of pro-Brexit, pro-Boris DUP MPs.”She insisted that “honestly, this is not a pact” and that “no party will have been aware of us taking this decision”. However, former high-profile SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill rejected that explanation and resigned from the SDLP in response to what she described as “a grubby sectarian pact dressed up as a remain one”.In announcing Sinn Fein’s decision, party leader Mary Lou McDonald urged the electorate to vote for “the pro-Remain candidates best placed to win the seats”.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
