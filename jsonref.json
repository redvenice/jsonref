[{"url":null,"title":"British photographer Adrian Bradshaw capture bygone street scenes 1980s China","story":"Share this article Adrian Bradshaw, a British photographer who moved to the Far East in 1984 to study Mandarin, is one of the few Westerners who were able to witness and document the country\u0027s recent transformation first hand.Few Chinese people owned cameras at the time, so Mr Bradshaw\u0027s unique archive of nearly two million pictures provides many intriguing insights into the lives of China\u0027s populace before the country\u0027s economic boom.\u0027Life was simpler and less stressed in many ways,\u0027 Mr Bradshaw recalled of his days in China during the early \u002780s.\u0027There seemed to be a greater sense of community, stemming perhaps from a sense of shared deprivation, and less privacy,\u0027 reflected the photographer, born in Cambridge and grew up in Wells, Somerset.From muddy street markets in the city, to workers painting over Chairman Mao\u0027s slogans, people seemed to welcome the changing times. Young men sporting tight jeans and big hair and cheeky children mocking foreigners, the China captured by his lens would be unrecognisable to the modern eye.         China was billed as \u0027the kingdom of bicycle\u0027 in the 1980s and private cars and taxis were hard to find. Dozens of cyclists try to cross a junction in Beijing in 1985 in the picture above. Nowadays, the nation\u0027s roads were filled with expensive private cars              The era heralded changing times in China when Communist images and slogans would soon be replaced by commercial billboards. Pictured left, a worker dusts off a portrait of Joseph Stalin in preparation for the National Day in Beijing in 1985. Pictured right, a slogan reading \u0027Long Live Mao Zedong Thought\u0027 is painted over to welcome new ideas in Beijing in 1985         Shoppers walk past counters selling winter clothing as saleswomen chat to each other at a department store in Beijing in 1985Mr Bradshaw arrived in China at the age of 20, unaware then that he would remain in the country for 30 years.From an ageing Norwegian ferry, his first sight of the mysterious land was the colonial-style waterfront of Shanghai - without the towering skyline it is famous for today.The Mandarin student was supposed to spend one year in the Beijing Languages Institute as part of his course with the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. Instead he found himself landing in the midst of a unique and rapid social transformation. He was enchanted. So much so he made the decision to halt his studies and stay.He said the people he met were \u0027young, optimistic, open to new experiences but bizarre\u0027.\u0027That suited my character at the time.\u0027The young Briton moved from Beijing to Shanghai in 1985, bought himself an old bike and began to explore the city with a small Leica camera in hand.         Welders work at a factory building cars to be used in the fast growing wedding photography sector in Changsha in 1990         A little boy smiles as he drives a toy car shaped like a tank in a playground outside the Workers Gymnasium in Beijing in 1989              People embraced new ways of life and thinking after Chinese leaders had vowed to develop economy and open up the nation to the West a few years earlier. Pictured left, pedestrians walk past a billboard advertising women\u0027s footwear from Hong Kong fashion label Daphne in Shanghai in 1986. Pictured right, a man prepares to e into a canal to cool off in Beijing in 1985He documented everything around him in black-and-white film.He snapped the pictures mostly to satisfy his own curiosity, along with work as a freelance photojournalist for international news agencies.\u0027My motives were not complicated,\u0027 said Mr Bradshaw, now 55 and based in Oxford.\u0027These pictures were mainly taken for my own record of people I met and places I visited for no other reason than curiosity.\u0027Nothing seemed to be impossible in those 10 years when the Chinese were met by new fashion, new equipment and new visitors.One of Mr Bradshaw\u0027s favourite pictures from his collection captures five young men on Shanghai\u0027s riverside with their bouffant hairdos and flared trousers.Mr Bradshaw said he was impressed by their sense of humour and confidence as well as their \u0027appetite for risk\u0027.         Five young men sporting cutting-edge fashion pose for a photo during a walk along Shanghai\u0027s waterfront in 1985. This is one of Mr Bradshaw\u0027s hand-picked favourites. \u0027The clothes and hair would have been shocking to older generations,\u0027 he said         Four young Cantonese hairdressers wait for customers at one of the first privately run hair salons in Beijing in 1987         A Pierre Cardin fashion show takes place in Beijing in 1985 at the newly opened Maxim\u0027s, a replica of his glamorous restaurant in Paris. The brand staged the first catwalk show in Communist China in 1979 at the Cultural Palace of Nationalities in Beijing         French fashion legend Yves Saint Laurent opens a retrospective exhibition of his work to bemused audience in Beijing in 1985\u0027The clothes and hair would have been shocking to older generations in a way we can barely imagine in the west, where breaching social norms was not the life-or-death matter it had been in China for so many until very shortly before this picture was taken.\u0027The other image he hand-picked shows Muhammad Ali, the late American boxing legend, practising moves with a Chinese cook in 1985.Ali, known as \u0027the king of boxing\u0027 in China and revered by its people, was visiting the country to promote the sport, which had been banned by the Communist Party for 27 years.His trip proved to be so well-received by Chinese leaders they decided to call off the ban a year later, allowing its athletes to compete internationally.\u0027I spent a week with Ali and his entourage. The experience was one that helped me make my decision to interrupt my studies and stay on in China,\u0027 Mr Bradshaw said.\u0027He was such a positive, strong character who brought out the best in people.\u0027         \u0027One of the first visitors to China I was asked to photograph was the great Muhammad Ali who was being sounded out as an advisor for Beijing\u0027s desire to host the Olympic Games in the future,\u0027 said Mr Bradshaw who snapped the picture in 1985              As recent as 30 years ago, residents of Shanghai lived in cramped rooms without flush toilets. Pictured left, two children riding tricycles enjoy the rare sight of a \u0027big nosed\u0027 foreigner in Shanghai in 1985. This is one of Mr Bradshaw\u0027s favourite pictures from the collection. Pictured right, people queue up under a new raised highway in Shanghai in 1990         This picture taken in 1986 shows a family taking a meal break during a shopping trip in Dali. Menus were basic, meat was scarce and food was rationed, but fresh ingredient were guaranteed in the days before widespread refrigerationChina was young then. The average age of its population was not yet 25, and families were raising the country\u0027s first generation of the \u0027single child\u0027.Little boys and girls seemed to be everywhere: on the street, in parks, outside schools and in the nooks and crannies of alleyways playing with their neighbours or simply running around.\u0027The picture of the two tricyclists making fun of me, the foreigner with the big nose, always makes me smile,\u0027 Mr Bradshaw referred to the photograph of a mischievous girl gesturing his Caucasian feature to her playmate in a residential lane in Shanghai.\u0027Children were even more confident than adults in that time and I felt their enthusiasm and sense of humour augured well for the future.\u0027         Children and adults watch on as thrill-seekers take a space-themed ride in Shanghai in 1985. \u0027Who knows, one of these children may have grown up to be a real astronaut? No-one imagined this could be possible at that time,\u0027 Mr Bradshaw said         A toddler learns to walk while a granny with bound feet watches on with a smile at a traditional lane in Chengdu in 1985         A little boy plays in an alleyway alone with a snack, a hat and a big stick to complement his confident pose in Taiyuan in 1985         A shop in Shanghai shows walkie-talkies made by a brand called Meile next to a figurine of an astronaut in its window in 1985         Father Christmas and Donald Duck, icons of Western culture, meet with welcoming crowds at a funfair in Beijing in 1986Mr Bradshaw brought his photo archive to Britain when he moved back in 2014.The large file of images - one million on film and another million digital - surprised his Chinese friends who came to England to visit him.That inspired him to organise the snapshots and bring them to a wider audience.Last year, he selected nearly 190 pictures and published them in a book called \u0027The Door Opened: 1980s China\u0027. \u0027As a photographer I have been privileged to bear witness to a country that never fails to amaze,\u0027 said Mr Bradshaw who continues to document his life as a photographer.         A young man in Shanghai hitches a free ride on a tricycle, a highly popular means of transport, on a busy street in 1985              Mr Bradshaw (pictured in the 1980s, left) arrived in China in 1984 as a language student. He was meant to learn Mandarin in Beijing for a year, but he soon decided to halt his studies and worked as a photographer. \u0027I have been privileged to bear witness to a country that never fails to amaze,\u0027 said the Briton (pictured recently, right), who is now 55 and based in Oxford         Street markets tended to be dominated by large quantities of the same produce and all prices were negotiable. The picture above shows a street market in Hefei in 1986. The provincial capital of Anhui is now a modern city with 800,000 residents         Courtiers take up position in the centre of the Forbidden City during a scene in the filming of The Last Emperor directed by Bernardo Bertolucci in Beijing in 1985. Mr Bradshaw helped negotiate access to the Forbidden City to make this film              Chinese people were more relaxed and less material-driven in the 1980s, which saw the end of collective economy. A middle-aged man is seen stretching his leg on the Bund in Shanghai in 1985 in the picture on the left above. A young woman is seen cycling through a bustling hutong, the traditional residential alleyway in Beijing in 1985 in the picture on the right \u0027Nowadays both China and myself are a bit older,\u0027 he added. \u0027Also there is a degree of cynicism that barely registered in the 1980s when everyone was so keen to try new things and felt increasing confidence about the future.\u0027He said if there was one thing he could do to make today\u0027s China better, that would be to \u0027break down the Great Firewall\u0027 which Beijing built to restrict people\u0027s access to Western websites.\u0027The opening of communications with the rest of the world is the single greatest achievement of the reform era and it should not be reversed, \u0027 he said, adding the benefits of the act would work in both directions.The streets, cities and people in Mr Bradshaw\u0027s works might not have the glitz of today\u0027s China, which has the world\u0027s second largest economy, boasts the world\u0027s largest bullet train system and built more skyscrapers last year than ever before.Nevertheless, they radiate an irresistible charm and innocence, which remains little known to the outside world, and fails to be defined by economic figures alone."},{"url":null,"title":"Michael Jordan lists little mountainside Utah mansion 6m","story":"Share this articleBasketball legend Michael Jordan lists modern Utah retreat for $7.5 million - Los Angeles Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman tells Men Black writer not mansplain offering clear film question","story":"Share this article          The alien comedy was a hit worldwide, grossing $250.6million in the United States and Canada"},{"url":null,"title":"Teacher sacked joking Jewish pupils ship gas chambers","story":"Share this article However, pupils informed their parents and the news soon spread on school WhatsApp groups.Many parents telephoned and emailed the head teacher to complain, with some even threatening to withdraw their children unless the staff member was dismissed.On Thursday evening, the board of governors held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue, and dismissed the teacher the next day. The action was instant because the woman was an agency worker, and therefore had no permanent employment contract with Newberries, it is understood.          On Thursday evening, the board of governors held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue, and dismissed the teacher the next dayThe school, which has 203 pupils aged four to 11, is in Radlett, Hertfordshire, a commuter village where around a quarter of the 8,000 residents identify as Jewish.One parent, who did not want to be named, said: ‘To the credit of the school they made it clear they wanted to deal with the situation without delay.‘They did not seek to dispute the suggestion that the teacher had made the reference to “gas chambers”. The fact that the woman was sacked the following day says everything you need to know.’ Yesterday, a spokesman for the school said: ‘We can confirm that last week we were made aware that an alleged racist comment had been made by an agency teacher working within the school.‘We acted on this immediately and our governors and leadership team are undertaking a full investigation. The agency teacher will not be returning.’After the dismissal, the school issued a newsletter reassuring parents that despite ‘recent events’, it was doing all it could to ‘embrace and celebrate ersity’.It said it would be inviting religious leaders from different faith groups in to speak to the children, as it had done in previous years.

It said the spread of incidents throughout the year – more than 100 a month – indicated a general atmosphere of intolerance and prejudice.The Daily Mail was not able to contact the sacked teacher. "},{"url":null,"title":"Home security camera saved womans life vanished camping South Australia","story":"Share this article \u0027He alerted police who went to the property and commenced a new search.\u0027Ms Pilgrim said she went for a walk before becoming lost.\u0027Went out for a walk in the bush and before I knew it, I didn\u0027t know where I was... simple as that,\u0027 she told 7News.\u0027I walked through the daytime and then slept at night, found little shanty places - properties - that people weren\u0027t living in.\u0027         Ms Pilgrim managed to leave an SOS signal on a dirt track, which was discovered by Neil and Betty Marriott\u0027s son through their CCTVMs Pilgrim said she tried to leave a trace of herself when she arrived at a new location, in the hope someone was looking for her.\u0027Each place I went to I hung around there and left signs, calling cards, waved to cameras,\u0027 she said.But Ms Pilgrim said she \u0027didn\u0027t think\u0027 anyone would be looking for her.  It was only when she heard police calling her name that she realised it wasn\u0027t the case.  The widespread search for Ms Pilgrim included a police helicopter, SAPOL\u0027s STAR Group, State Tactical Response Group, Murray Mallee police, Mounted Operations and SES volunteers and drones.          Ms Pilgrim said she went for a walk before becoming lost. \u0027Went out for a walk in the bush and before I knew it, I didn\u0027t know where I was... simple as that,\u0027 she told 7NewsThere were plans for the search to enter its fourth day on Wednesday, before Ms Pilgrim was found overnight.  South Australian police confirmed Ms Pilgrim was taken to Angaston Hospital for a routine check up after the ordeal.

Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo both deserved to winWas deciding on a winner for the Booker prize, a friend asked at the awards ceremony, a bit like giving birth? She then relayed the story of how, after carefully nurturing her pregnancy for months, the doctors became increasingly desperate to get her baby out before something went wrong. And there was the happiest of endings, when her child was born safely, in good health.Yes, I said, it was a lot like that. Only at that point, we discovered it was twins.Much like the mysteries of conception, I can’t tell you why we judges were given the books we were given this year. Nor can I explain how the precise configuration of our life stories, professional experience, personalities and behavioural tendencies led us to a marathon meeting, with just barely hours to go until the ceremony itself, still arguing over how to choose a winner. On the details of those deliberations I am sworn to secrecy. But all of these factors mattered.It was a shock to us all to discover how dramatic the final decision would be. But choosing a winner for the Booker is a curious thing. You read, read and read. Each month you meet your fellow judges and look back, in awe, at the distance covered. Until one day, you have to somehow condense all of this to a single book.It’s an inevitably problematic task. Every single book on our longlist of 13 novels deserves to be read by everyone. I’m still mourning some of the books we had to eliminate at that stage. Never mind the shortlist of just six, each and every one good enough to win the prize.How do you judge the titanic career, the contribution to culture of Margaret Atwood, against the sheer beauty of Elif Shafak’s Istanbul? How do you compare the haunting Igbo tragedy, told by Chigozie Obioma’s Odyssean narrator, to the Ulysses-like audacity of Lucy Ellmann? How do you pit the phenomenon of Salman Rushdie against the quality and consistency of Bernardine Evaristo, who was in my view hitherto hugely underrated?In the end, we refused to comply. We chose two winners. The outcome would always be imperfect, because it was an impossible task. I’m proud of our decision.I’m bemused by the criticisms, many of which stem from the fact that the Booker rules stipulate that only one book can win. I witnessed journalists – a tribe of professional troublemakers of which I’m proud to call myself a member – outraged that we dared to break the rules. I’ve seen lawyers, whose profession involves interpretation and the application of principles of justice, complain that we did not adhere to the letter of the law.

It will also chart her writing career, from the 83 rejection letters she received when she sent out her first book to her gaining the laureateship in 2013. #Merky Books said the autobiography would be “empowering and inspiring”. It described Blackman’s series Noughts and Crosses, which is set in a world where the dominant population is black, as one that “sparked a new and necessary conversation about race and identity in the UK” when it was published in 2000.The children’s author said she “couldn’t be more excited and delighted” with her new publisher. “Not only will my autobiography be a full and frank account of my life journey as an author,” she said, “it will also contain all the writer’s tips and tricks I’ve learned over the years.”Stormzy has called the Noughts and Crosses series his “favourite books of all time”, which “showed me just how amazing storytelling could be”.The grime star’s #Merky imprint is part of Penguin Random House. It publishes two or three books a year and is intended to be “a home for a new generation of voices”.

Work in one and suffer loneliness or worse. Set foot in one in any capacity and immediately feel your options narrowing. There may be only one way in but there will be two ways out, one of which you don’t want to think about. They rise out of the land – and the sea – with the undeniable power of a symbol, a prophecy.In 1998, a friend working in publishing asked me to read a novel that had recently been published in France, Pharricide by Vincent de Swarte, and write a report on it. I fell immediately and deeply in love with it and wrote in my report that not only should the UK publisher obtain the rights, but they should let me translate it. They didn’t obtain the rights and so I spent the next 20 years trying to find a publisher willing to take it on. Finally, I struck lucky with Confingo Publishing, my translation appearing earlier this year – too late for De Swarte, who sadly died in 2006 aged only 42.Pharricide tells the story of amateur taxidermist Geoffroy Lefayen, who embarks on a six-month stint as solo lighthouse keeper at Cordouan off the French Atlantic coast. As he unpacks his knives, he prays that not a soul comes to the lighthouse during the time that he’s there.1. Pharos by Alice ThompsonAll of Scottish author Thompson’s novels feature details from surrealist paintings on their covers – by Ernst, Delvaux, Magritte, De Chirico and Conroy Maddox – apart from this one, her third, but it could easily have done. A ghost story about a haunted lighthouse and island, it has a dreamlike atmosphere similar to that in her later novel Burnt Island. Characters are always noticing other characters walking across the beach towards them, as if out of nowhere. Stephen King is a fan.2. The Lighthouse by Alison MooreThe key lighthouse in this Booker-shortlisted novel is a small silver case that once contained a phial of perfume owned by the main character’s mother. Futh carries the little silver lighthouse everywhere. Were it to be lost or stolen, one imagines, the consequences would be dire. There is another lighthouse, in Futh’s childhood, and there’s one on the cover, which appears black, but only because it is a negative image of a white lighthouse. The owner of a black lighthouse telephoned the publishers to express righteous anger that permission had not been sought to photograph her lighthouse. It fell to me, as the book’s editor, to call her back. I enjoyed making that call.3. The Thing on the Shore by Tom FletcherIf a lighthouse is a symbol, it may be a phallic one, as Helen Dunmore concedes in her lovely Granta piece about Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse. Here, however, Whitehaven lighthouse – painted red and white with a green “eye” – is closely associated with the main character Arthur’s mother. A novel that reads as if HP Lovecraft had moved to West Cumbria in 2011.4. The Lighthouse by Agnes OwensIn this short story, a beach is full of threats and dangers. Megan wants to go to the lighthouse, but her younger brother Bobby does not. She warns him that a monster might get him if he doesn’t comply. His understanding of “monster” is unusual and we worry about the man in the grey tracksuit, even the woman walking her dog. The absent parents may be neglectful. The man in the grey tracksuit says it’s not safe: they might get hit by a golf ball. Megan repeats part of the warning to Bobby before heading off. A pitiless story well told.6. The Wreck of the Aurora by Patrick McGrathIn this vivid and powerful short story, first published in ST Joshi’s anthology A Mountain Walked, the building of a lighthouse on a “hunk of basalt” protruding from the Pacific Ocean is described in terms that remind one of the construction of a pyramid. This lighthouse will become synonymous with death when one night its keeper locks his companions in their rooms and turns off the power. Years later a woman visits the rock to try to understand why the keeper – her father – killed the light.7. The Lighthouse by PD JamesJames’s long-serving detective Adam Dalgliesh, making his 13th appearance, is a poet as well as a policeman. If poetry depends on concision and the avoidance of cliche, it’s a little ironic that he ends up in this long book alongside a character sporting “large hazel eyes” and “an aquiline nose”. There has been a death, possibly a murder, on an island off the Cornish coast where the prime minister is hoping to organise a meeting of minds. It’s hard to remain undistracted by the thought of one’s actual PM being helicoptered out to the same island and ideally staying there.8. To the Lighthouse by Virginia WoolfTo the Lighthouse is partly about power and largely about portraying consciousness, but as a reading experience it can feel like an exercise in eternally delayed gratification. It has been acclaimed as a masterpiece since its appearance in 1927. But it’s not exactly long on action, and the young boy James is not the only one who wants to get to the sodding lighthouse. You start to wonder if Woolf will have the bottle actually to postpone arrival beyond the end of the novel. No spoilers here.9. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeerTo the Lighthouse with guns. All the action Woolf left out ended up in this first part of VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy, published in 2014. Four female scientists are transported into an abandoned landscape, Area X, where they face treachery and constant danger. A distant lighthouse represents the possibility of escape. Essentially the record of a really, really bad trip, this is much, much better than the film.10. The Lighthouse by Edgar Allan PoeSoloing in a lighthouse designed to be looked after by three men, the purported writer of this brief account opens a logbook on the first day of January 1796 by confiding his wish to be alone. By day two he is in ecstasy. Could this fragment of an unfinished story, the diary of a lighthouse keeper, written in 1849 and now available online, have inspired Pharricide?• Pharricide by Vincent de Swarte (translated by Nicholas Royle) is published by Confingo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a35502c2af8a42e905ba1f5a3abc1ebe828417/0_552_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed0e99c2c074fe55b6e6c67173ebc8","title":"250m second neil woodford fund frozen","story":"Administrator closes Income Focus fund to withdrawals to prevent run on its assetsA second investment fund set up by the failed stock picker Neil Woodford has been frozen, locking up more than £250m of savers’ money.The administrator, Link Fund Solutions, said it had closed the Income Focus fund to withdrawals to prevent a run on its assets. The fund’s value has halved to £252m since June, when Woodford’s flagship Equity Income fund was suspended.Link closed Woodford’s main fund to withdrawals in June and sacked him as its manager on Tuesday after deciding to wind up the £3.1bn fund. Woodford then quit the Income Focus fund and the publicly traded Woodford Patient Capital investment trust.Woodford announced he was closing down his investment business on Tuesday, his reputation in shreds. He earned many millions in fees during the business’s four years of trading and had continued to draw fees from the Equity Income fund while savers’ money was trapped.The Income Focus fund will be suspended until further notice and reviewed every 28 days. The investment vehicle, worth about £750m two years ago, could be closed permanently like the Equity Income fund, Link said.“During the fund’s suspension, we will consider the options available to us including the appointment of an alternate investment manager, a scheme of arrangement into another fund or a winding up of the fund,” the administrator said.Woodford was Britain’s best-known fund manager when he left Invesco in 2015 to launch his own business. But failed bets on small and difficult-to-trade firms and some large public companies sent investors dashing for the exits.Woodford’s failure, and the impact on savers, threatens to undermine confidence in the fund management industry. The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating the Woodford debacle but the regulator has been criticised for its own lack of action as Woodford got into deeper trouble.Parliament’s Treasury committee will elect a new chair next week. The successful candidate, who will be a Conservative MP, may decide the committee should launch an inquiry into all aspects of Woodford’s failure.

One is that, awful though Brexit is, the leave vote must be honoured in the least damaging way. The other is that Britain’s departure from the European Union is so mistaken that it must be reversed, once again with least damage.More than three years on some of us are still juggling, even as Boris Johnson heads to Brussels. The thing that keeps the juggling alive is not, in the end, an inability to make up our minds. I am a remainer. Full stop. The question is how to respond to Brexit in the political circumstances of the moment, in the best long-term interests of the country as a whole? The answer has evolved. But it will soon be make-our-minds-up time.Back in 2016 my response to the leave victory was to lament it bitterly but to say that Britain should continue to hug Europe as close as possible, even while leaving. This would help to protect jobs, secure the Irish peace process, and allow Scotland’s remain vote to be treated with enough respect to avoid Brexit becoming a threat to the union. A decade or so down the line, my rationale went, it might then be possible to reopen the question of EU membership, especially if the EU had continued to evolve in a multispeed manner, and if post-Jeremy Corbyn Labour had got off the fence to support Britain’s place in Europe.Instead, the longer that process has gone on, the wider the gap has grown between the original democratic deference owed to the idea of “leaving” in 2016 and the real-world consequences of the detailed version on offer in 2019. Simultaneously, however, the passage of time has made no difference at all to one very big thing: the concern among many leave voters that what they wanted in 2016 has still not happened. To reconcile these two realities is almost impossible, because it pits the malleable pragmatism of representative government against the rigid mandate of government by populist referendum.As the process has lengthened, so the options have widened. This isn’t the conspiracy that some claim to see. It is simply the entropy of politics at work. Few talked about a second referendum back in 2016. But the issue is central to the debate now. Almost no one in 2016, certainly not Johnson, imagined the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all. Today, despite the ongoing talks, no deal is a Johnson government policy option. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, reversing the 2016 result had few supporters. Today it is the policy of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP and both are prospering in the polls.There is no perfect choice to be made on Brexit. The fault with that lies in the way the referendum process was devised – verdict first, terms later. All the options come with risks, often very big ones. But we don’t solve anything by wishing we could have made better choices at previous turnings along the way. The here and now choice takes two forms. The first is between Johnson’s deal, no deal and remaining in the EU. The other, which applies as much to hardline leavers as it does to remainers, is between folding and fighting on.The case for Johnson’s deal is that it means Britain leaves the EU in line with the referendum vote. That’s not a minor civic consideration. People are weary and angry. A deal could draw some of the worst poison from public attitudes to politics. It would satisfy the many (more than some of us want to think) who just want the whole thing over, although in reality almost everything about Britain’s future relationship with the EU is still to be decided. It might, if you agree with Corbyn, allow a general election to be fought on “real”, that is to say domestic, economic and social issues.But it would still be a terrible deal and that can’t be ignored, however weary we are. It would mean buying a pig in a poke and hoping that what’s inside entails a good future for the British people. It would defer rather than solve the Irish border crisis. It would risk breaking up the union. It would instantly worsen the UK’s trading position, with severe short- and long-term impacts on the economy and jobs. It would weaken the UK in the negotiations during the transition period. And it would set Britain at odds with its only true geographic and regional allies.The lesson of the past three years needs to be faced. That lesson is not that politicians are out of touch or failing to listen. It is the opposite. It’s not that the country can get along with Brexit. It is the opposite of that too. The lesson is that Brexit won’t work.Brexit won the vote. But it’s an ideology not a policy. When its supporters tried to turn it into policies, as they are still trying to do, it fell apart. It made things worse. These three years have been the leavers’ fault and no one else’s. That’s why obstructing no deal has been so important.But it’s also why preventing Johnson’s deal is important too. Optimism and slapdash policy will not make Britain a global power. Theresa May was right when she said Brexit means Brexit. That’s exactly what’s wrong with it. It’s why, in the end, Britain has to do everything possible to retain its place in Europe, in spite of the difficulties, and persuade its people in a new campaign – not with a message of fear, but with a message that pro-Europeans are listening to what’s wrong with the country.It certainly will not be easy. Most battles are not fought on ground of one’s own choosing. But as long as the passage of time and the sheer folly of Brexit permit the possibility of remaining, Britain should make up its mind to remain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d96c35e13bf6fce653b2285e10899608935773/613_204_2787_1673/master/2787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a94fe8c20f445a7df74d5cbf5bdedea","title":"eu common good brexit process european union","story":"“The greatest challenge of our times,” Donald Tusk declared in a speech a few days ago in Athens, “is how to make out of politics what it once was: acting and thinking for the common good.” At the moment, he continued, “politics is understood as war: even if shots are not fired everywhere, almost everywhere some part, some fragment of the whole, wants to destroy, invalidate or totally subordinate the others”.One of the most unfortunate implications of Brexit is that we seem to have lost interest in discussing the visions for the European Union set out by its leaders. We focus mostly on their tweets, and indeed only the subset of tweets that is directly relevant to the fate of Brexit. And the more the public loses sight of what else goes on in the EU apart from Brexit, the fewer tools we have to engage with its politics in the future.Tusk’s speech in Athens, ahead of a decisive meeting of the European council this week, deserved much more critical scrutiny. Tusk cited Thucydides and Cicero and referred to an ancient ideal of freedom that philosophers in the past have contrasted with “the freedom of the moderns”. The freedom of the ancients, it is often said, is characterised by shared commitment to the public good, equal laws and equal participation in public debate. The freedom of the moderns, on the other hand, is that of iniduals pursuing their private interests, with the role of the state limited to guaranteeing their orderly interactions.Tusk’s appeal to a robust, civic ideal of the common good is especially welcome if one contrasts his vision with the imperial one endorsed on multiple occasions by Guy Verhofstadt, another prominent EU politician whose Brexit tweets make news. Better the republic than the empire, of course. But it was more than a little ironic that Tusk criticised the modern politics of subordination: pontificating about respecting democratic participation and refraining from domination in a place like Greece, in the aftermath of the 2015 referendum, is like mentioning the rope in the house of the hanged, as the German saying goes.Nor does the EU look like it has learned any lessons on how to treat all its partners as equals in the future. Just look at the way it is handling the process of enlargement in the western Balkans, an item high on the agenda of the council meeting. Countries such as Albania and North Macedonia, which are expecting to open accession negotiations, are effectively held hostage by a process where deadlines come and go between faint praise and serious warnings that “not enough progress has been done” to “fight corruption” and “strengthen the rule of law”. Or consider how power politics and commercial interests shape the other issue that is likely to be debated in the meeting of the council this week: Turkey. The timidity of the European response to the butchering of civilians in north-east Syria is, as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s threat to “open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees” makes amply clear, a direct consequence of the EU’s purely self-interested border deals. The lives of millions of innocent people are traded for a few hundred votes in response to the “threat of migration” come the next round of elections. In this there is at least one aspect in common with the ancient world: the ancient Greeks were keen to distinguish between themselves and the inferior “barbarians”.For the rest, the EU cannot refashion itself as a champion of the common good, of the freedom of the ancients, for the simple reason that it exists to promote the freedom of the moderns, commercial interests and market competition, private vices as public benefits. It cannot be kept together by civic patriotism because its political ends are set by market purposes. When these collide and fail to work for everyone, we get a distinctively modern version of stasis, characterised not only by the shortage of pragmatic solutions to problems that have in the meantime become existential but, more dramatically, by a shortage of vision.Brexit is contributing to this shortage of vision. The idiosyncrasies of the process, the whims of the protagonists and the isive passions of the public give the EU a veneer of calm, competence, and wisdom. The more recklessly Johnson and company act, the more responsible the EU looks. The more the UK government violates procedures, ignores institutional constraints, or tries to find ad hoc ways out of the process, the more the EU’s capacity to stick to rules and deliver by the deadlines appear like the highest political virtues. In all this we forget to ask who the rules benefit, and to what purpose deadlines are applied.We should not be fooled by the EU rhetoric of the common good. Its domestic order is marred by injustices and asymmetries of power, and the implications of its international stance on questions including border control and harm to civilians (as in the recent case of Kurdish people in Syria) are nothing short of criminal.Brexit will come to an end, one way or another – but the EU will continue to condition the debate and structure political relations for the foreseeable future. In trying to survive our extraordinary predicament, we should not neglect the ordinary delinquency of the EU, nor depoliticise its motives. We would be doing ourselves no favours in the long run.• Lea Ypi is professor of political theory at the London School of Economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfda791c5399bed039def656afd5cd23e94bcd6/0_190_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22eaef249406127ed95dd7144bf2ded5","title":"non meat eaters rejoice vegan sausage rolls are taking over the world","story":"Greggs’ magical stumps of meat-free stodge are so good, everyone is copying them.

And on behalf of vegetarians everywhere, I would like to celebrate the scraping of Greggs and their vegan sausage rolls. How I love those magical little stumps of meat-free stodge. One measly pound’s worth of sheer joy.Greggs is obviously shifting them, because the scraping has now started in earnest. One morning last week I stopped at a BP garage heading north out of Liverpool. In the Wild Bean Cafe, lying there nonchalantly as you like, was a vegan sausage roll. Slightly flakier of pastry than the Greggs original, and possibly with slightly more filling, it did the job. But at roughly four times the price of a Greggs VSR, I’m not sure it represented great value.And later that day there was more VSR action, this time at The Pasty Shop at Manchester Piccadilly. Again, it was half-decent, but at a reassuringly high price that would buy you five Greggs VSRs. Not sure if many people could eat five Greggs at one sitting (I could, easily), but I suppose you could freeze them for a rainy day.If you want to spend that much on a really top-drawer VSR, may I warmly recommend AMT Coffee’s offering. The pastry is so flaky you will leave a trail as you walk away a trail that you can then follow back to buy another one. Oddly though, only some AMTs have them. If you enquire at an AMT that doesn’t, they look at you as if you have asked for a piece of moon rock. And you are met with similar bafflement at the West Cornwall Pasty Company, Delice de France and others.

That put me off for years.I grew up in west London in a working-class, single-parent family. My mother, who was a chauffeur, had my sister when I was 13 it was a difficult birth and she was in intensive care for a long time. She also suffered from postnatal depression, so I spent a lot of time caring for my baby sister on my own. I took her everywhere I went I bathed her, fed her, and brought her up.It affected my performance in school. I didn’t pay attention in class, do my homework or revise for my exams. No one at home encouraged me to study and no one in school knew about my family responsibilities. Around this time, a careers advisor said I wouldn’t pass my exams. I was told I should go straight to work because I wasn’t intelligent enough for further study.Although I didn’t revise, I did get C grades in my GCSEs and a BTec diploma in performing arts. I then started work as a receptionist. I had my first daughter at 21 and my second four years later. At this point I left what had become a violent relationship and became a single parent.By my late 20s, I’d regained some of my confidence. I started to think about studying again. I had my mind set on becoming a barrister they’re well respected and self-employed, which I thought would give me the flexibility to look after my children – and I wanted to make them proud of me. So I started an access to law course at London South Bank University.Once I got over my nerves, I started to enjoy studying again. But it was strange to be alongside 18-year-olds at the university when I was 28. Sometimes they’d talk through lectures and didn’t seem to appreciate the costs involved in being there. When you’re studying as a single parent, it helps to have a routine. I’ll put my children to bed and stay up late to study when they’re asleep. And it’s worked so far. I graduated with a first in law and won two scholarships. The awards meant I could afford to take my bar professional training course (BPTC), which I’m doing now. My children keep telling everyone I’m a barrister already and I have to tell them, not quite yet.I plan to specialise in social welfare and housing benefit, because many people in these areas don’t have access to legal aid. It’s not a level playing field for them. They’re often unrepresented and end up getting unjust verdicts. I want to be able to help them.Sometimes I still doubt myself. I worry I won’t pass the BPTC.

We hope that won’t be the case and that we’ll be able to restart the project very soon.”The council said it would still be progressing with the studio plans and will look for other investors, but may also complete the project without outside investment. Councillors are expected to agree to spend up to £3.4m to cover any pre-development costs.Pacifica Ventures founded its Albuquerque studio in 2007, which was bought by Netflix in 2018, having being used for numerous productions including Breaking Bad, Sicario and The Avengers.In March 2018, it was named as the developer taking on what Barking council and London City Hall called “the next global destination for making blockbuster movies”.With an estimated cost of £110m, plans for the 22-acre project include 12 sound stages, training facilities, amusement attractions, shops and restaurants. It had been hoped construction would begin later this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c50c82c4c5945fb0fa7afff35b9d76ef9795509/0_273_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bef4532e8df3c8422baf143ce896f3fb","title":"kim joys recipe for multicoloured shortbread buttons","story":"These vanilla-flavoured treats are easy to make, super-cute and ideal as giftsThese make great gifts if you thread them together and package them up.

The attendance will smash the 45,619 record for an England Women home fixture, set at the last meeting with Germany at Wembley in 2014.The crowd in the 90,000-capacity stadium should also top the 80,203 that watched the USA’s defeat of Japan at Wembley in the final of the 2012 Olympics. That is the record for a women’s game in England.Sue Campbell, the Football Association’s director of women’s football, said: “This is a magnificent show of support for the squad and staff after a tremendous year of progress for the England team … What will make it even more special is to see everyone who has bought a ticket turn up on the day to help smash the all-time record on English soil. My message to them is to come and be a part of history.”The Manchester United manager Casey Stoney, a former England defender, described it as a “dream come true”.“I played for Chelsea first team aged 12 so I’ve been involved in the game at the top level for 25 years and I didn’t ever, ever think I’d see the day,” she said. “What an occasion. Let’s hope the performance matches the occasion and that everyone wants to come back.“It just shows you where the game is going. If you put it on at the right time, in the right stadiums and you market it well enough, it will sell.”With England’s record for a game outside Wembley broken by 29,238 fans watching their 2-1 defeat by Brazil at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium, interest in the Lionesses is rising after their World Cup semi-final exit.That is mirrored domestically, with more than 100,000 people attending the opening three rounds of the Women’s Super League, topping the approximately 92,000 who attended across all 110 games last season.The record 31,213 crowd for Manchester City v Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium, 24,790 at the London Stadium and 24,564 at Stamford Bridge make up the bulk of that figure but games played in clubs’ more traditional homes are also seeing an attendance increase."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6b605c7b9a6e8fd9b94170c6102f8f018e9de58/0_109_4172_2504/master/4172.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7af3a38bb8949776336f91caba9fd03","title":"la liga calls for upcoming clasico to be moved from barcelona to madrid","story":"Barcelona intend to resist attempts to move the clásico on 26 October from the Camp Nou to the Santiago Bernabéu after the Spanish league proposed the change amid protest and unrest in the Catalan capital. Real Madrid are also reluctant to have the match moved, although they would be open to a postponement. The decision will be made by the three-man competition committee next week, with an announcement expected on Wednesday, just three days before the game is due to take place.Nine Catalan separatist leaders were jailed on Monday, handed sentences of between nine and 13 years for their role in an illegal referendum and the failed bid for independence in 2017. That ruling from the Supreme Court sparked protests, with police charges and confrontations across Catalonia. Barcelona’s El Prat airport was blocked, as were some roads. Reports said that more than 50 people have been arrested, while police used rubber and foam bullets.Barcelona, who have always had a close identification with social and political Catalanism and are often seen as the region’s unofficial “national” team, released a statement immediately after the rulings in which they insisted that prison sentences were not the solution. The match against Madrid would be their first at home since the imprisonments, but they have no plans to postpone or change the fixture. First, they travel to Eibar this Saturday.The league wrote to the Spanish Federation on Wednesday to ask that the game be switched from the Camp Nou to the Bernabéu to avoid any potential trouble, due to what it described as “exceptional circumstances beyond our control.” A demonstration has been planned on the same day in the city.The Federation acknowledged receipt of the request and have handed the decision over to the competition committee, which is made up of one representative from the league, one from the federation and one independent member. The committee have passed the information on to the two clubs and given them until Monday to respond. Barcelona are yet to say anything publicly, but they do not welcome the suggestion and nor do they see a need to change where the game is played. A judgment will be made after both clubs have had the chance to respond and although their arguments will be heard, the decision will not be theirs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d50c7ff24925d3ad41e7af3c110073a6b7c47665/0_165_3258_1955/master/3258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4eb8666abe65e98a68b896ec200a4d9","title":"the fiver republic o ireland euro 2020","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!If football is the opium of the people, distracting them from everyday cruelties imposed by their rulers, then over the years Republic O’Ireland fans have had to serve as something far stronger – morphine in craic form – to distract people from the horrors inflicted by their football team. If any neutral wants O’Ireland to reach Euro 2020, then it is only because their fans bring song and Tin, while out on the pitch their team kicks in the shopfront windows of decent folks’ sensibilities.Actually, maybe the head trauma sustained by watching the last two matches played by Mick McCarthy’s side has rendered The Fiver unduly harsh. After all, back in 1990 O’Ireland advanced to the World Cup quarter-final by scoring two goals in five matches, whereas McCarthy’s men stand top of their qualification group for Euro 2020 thanks to artful exhibitions of derring-do that have yielded six goals in seven games. That’s progress in anyone’s ledger, even if two of those matches were against the British campsite XI, Gibraltar.Yet McCarthy faces criticism in the wake of his team’s most recent sorties, Saturday’s 0-0 draw in Georgia – where the manager omitted an in-form Premier League striker, Aaron Connelly, because Luton Town’s James Collins is better at defending throw-ins – and Tuesday’s 2-0 battering by Switzerland, in which O’Ireland set out in a new formation with 11 players apparently selected at random from a bus stop just before kick-off. “I don’t think the system caused us to have an inability to pass the ball to one another, so I’m not taking the rap for that,” stormed McCarthy.Still, the manager reckons those matches will be forgotten if his team secure qualification by winning their last one, at home to Denmark next month. That won’t be easy because captain Séamus Coleman will be suspended. But Matt Doherty should fill in well. The bigger concern, then, may be that the Irish will also be without their joint top-scorer, Joseph Chipolina, the Gibraltar defender whose own goal in Dublin in June set up Ireland’s biggest win of the campaign so far.“As an Irishman it’s always been easy to dislike the English. As a football fan it’s been easy to see modern footballers as overpaid prima donnas. However, to see the way the English players conducted themselves on Monday night in the presence of neanderthals was so impressive and inspiring (and I don’t use that word easily). The continued head in sand mentality has to stop. Hopefully this might start a change” – Gareth Aherne.“The England players have rightly received huge plaudits for their strong and dignified response to racism in Bulgaria. Would it be fair to say that one of the many hurdles football faces next is for players to condemn racist acts by their teammates or club colleagues just as strongly? Rather than, say, dismissing it as b@nter by multi-linguists or ringing up the nearest T-shirt print shop” – Tim.“Twice in the last couple of months I have been forced to acknowledge quality writing from The Fiver when you have written about racism (yesterday’s Fiver).

Senior government figures have been asking the former Tories what they would need to vote for a deal and prevent an extension, but many have worries about being pressed into voting for an agreement with insufficient scrutiny.“On some things there will be a strange sort of common concern that draws from the ERG to DUP to former Tory rebels along the lines of the DUP, perhaps for different reasons.“I don’t think it’s a dead cert for any of them that they will vote for it … I will be very much studying the substance but there are concerns about the shape what has been submitted so far. It is also that Theresa May made a commitment to parliament over its role on the future relationship and the big question will be: what shape does the political declaration take?“They are only going on what they’ve read in the media, but none of them are people who will just vote for any deal. There are obviously different concerns within the group about what they want to see but it’s broadly along the lines of something that has to work for the whole of the UK.”So far, only a handful of MPs, including Anne Milton and Caroline Nokes, have been invited into Downing Street for private talks on what they could accept. Others, such as Hammond and Gauke, have not yet been summoned.Another source close to the 21 former Tory MPs said: “A deal for Northern Ireland and a very hard Brexit for the rest of the UK is much worse than what Theresa May got.”Despite reservations, Margot James, a member of the group, said she would probably vote for the deal even though she has concerns about what is being proposed.“I’m very keen to avoid leaving without a deal and therefore I will certainly give whatever proposals can be agreed with the European Union a very favourable look, no matter how many reservations I have about what I’m hearing,” the former business minister told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One.“All I can say at the moment is I would give it the benefit of the doubt. I don’t want to vote against it, but yes I am very concerned. Everything I hear indicates it is worse than the deal proposed by the former prime minister, but of course that deal couldn’t get through the house.”Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Guto Bebb are likely to vote against a Brexit deal unless it has a second referendum attached.Grieve said on Wednesday that he would push for an extension to article 50 to go ahead regardless of whether the prime minister brings back the outline of a deal from the European summit this week.“It’s clear that a final Brexit deal will not be agreed this week … That means the Benn act comes into play, and an extension to the article 50 deadline must be requested by law,” he said after meetings in Brussels.“That extension would prevent us from falling over a no-deal Brexit cliff-edge. And as we made clear in our meetings, that extension must also be of a sufficient length to organise for the people to have the final say and resolve the Brexit crisis.”There have been suggestions that the former Conservatives could have the whip restored if they vote for a deal, although Sam Gyimah has defected to the Liberal Democrats and is committed to a second referendum, while Rory Stewart is running as an independent to be mayor of London.At the same time, Tory sources have suggested Eurosceptics who refuse to back any deal proposed by the prime minister could also have the whip removed.James said it would be “good for them not to operate a system of double standards” and for No 10 sack any Tories who do not back Johnson’s withdrawal agreement.“I think that’s the thinking behind why the whip has not been offered back to us,” the independent MP said. “The government wants to make clear this is a highly disciplined environment and all members of parliament on the Conservative side should follow the Conservative whip in a vote as important as this one.”David Lidington, who was Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, said MPs would have to compromise if a deal were to be approved, or else risk the EU losing patience.“It seems to me the omens are good. It seems they are edging very close indeed to a deal and I really hope with all my heart it succeeds,” the former Europe minister told the BBC. “I think it is really important for parliamentarians in all parties in Westminster to realise that extensions just postpone the moment of decision.”Johnson’s hopes of reaching a deal were hanging in the balance on Wednesday as the DUP was not fully on board with his proposals over issues of consent and the customs union.Hardline Eurosceptics have, however, been sounding relatively positive towards Johnson’s proposals in recent days, with Steve Baker, the chair of the European Research Group, saying he was optimistic about voting for a “tolerable” deal and telling his colleagues to “trust in the PM”.However, the former Brexit secretary David Davis said the support of Tory Eurosceptics could not be taken for granted, and MPs would subject any agreement to “two or three key tests” – including whether it compromised the future of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f536de3bd4c53685e516de7512a25ec64fbf1a/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d32d0d2962fa3734ff1c67a73af699","title":"nasa unveils spacesuits worn first woman moon","story":"Next-generation garments for Artemis programme will be used during 2024 lunar missionNasa has unveiled two spacesuits designed to be worn by the first woman to walk on the moon.The next-generation suits were made for the Artemis programme, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024.Speaking at Nasa’s headquarters, the administrator, Jim Bridenstine, and spacesuit engineers presented the first closeup look at the suits.A bulky, mostly white prototype with blue and red arms was demonstrated by Kristine Davis, a spacesuit engineer at the Johnson Space Center.The garment, known as the exploration extravehicular mobility unit (xEMU), is designed for exploring the lunar surface, specifically the south pole – the target for Nasa’s next crewed lunar landing.“Kristine is wearing a spacesuit that will fit all of our astronauts when we go to the moon,” Bridenstine said. “These are our spacesuits for the Artemis generation.”The suit is more flexible than previous generation suits, allowing astronauts to squat to pick up rocks and move more easily. The insulation is designed to withstand a temperature range of -150C to 120C.“If we remember the Apollo generation, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin bunny-hopped on the surface of the moon,” Bridenstine said. “Now we are actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different from our suits of the past.”A new orange pressure suit, the Orion crew survival system, was worn by the spacesuit engineer Dustin Gohmert. It will be used by astronauts when they launch into space on the Orion capsule and return to Earth.The focus on spacesuits designed to fit a more erse crew comes after plans for the first all-female spacewalk had to be scrapped this year because there were not enough medium-size spacesuits.Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station to install batteries, but in the event only Koch was able to take part in the walk.Another attempt at an all-female spacewalk, involving Koch and Jessica Meir, is scheduled to take place on Thursday.

On Monday, the Los Angeles Lakers star finally broke his silence on the tweet heard around the world: Daryl Morey’s message of support for the Hong Kong protestors that’s threatened to upset the multibillion-dollar relationship between the NBA and the Chinese market it has spent three decades cultivating.LeBron told a group of reporters that Morey “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand” and that “so many people could have been harmed not only financially, physically, emotionally, spiritually” by the Houston Rockets executive’s seemingly off-the-cuff post. “So just be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too,” he said.LeBron is getting quite a bit of heat right now for comments that appear to suggest freedom of speech can have negative consequences. But at the same time it’s clear these remarks are largely being weaponized by many bad-faith actors trading in intellectual dishonesty in an effort to undermine the causes at home, including the state-sanctioned killings of unarmed black men in America, that LeBron has worked so hard to bring attention to. And why this erasure is happening is worthy of closer inspection.LeBron almost immediately clarified his remarks, saying he was not referencing the substance of Morey’s tweet, rather the way it created a potentially unsafe and hostile environment for the Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who were in China for a preseason tour. Did Morey put the them in harm’s way? Could he have made the same valid points after they had returned home safely? Was it his place to put them in the middle of that fight? All valid questions from the athlete’s point of view.The premise that LeBron is not in touch with the gravity of the situation is Hong Kong is a misconception. But rather than parrot anodyne talking points, he took a leadership role among his cohorts on the ground in China amid the unexpected crisis, reportedly organizing a players-only meeting as the situation unfolded. One source told the Athletic’s Shams Charani that in the meeting – which featured players from the Lakers and Nets – players wanted to address why they were the ones that had to risk speaking out while they were in China, when the league should be the first ones to address the matter.This is not the act of a soulless profiteer as LeBron has been quickly cast, but a leader using his voice and agency to gather those around him and make sure everyone is on the same page in how to responsibly navigate an international crisis.TV pundits around the country spent Tuesday teeing off on what they viewed as LeBron’s hypocrisy while only exposing their own, following Donald Trump’s example of using sport as a racially isive tool for scapegoating and grandstanding to push a political agenda. To no one’s surprise Fox News led the charge.In the morning it was Fox’s Jared Max, who said: “I think LeBron James is thinking about himself. I don’t think he’s thinking about what people in Hong Kong are fighting for in this case. It’s OK to tweet when it’s LeBron’s issue, but when it’s something else hat he’s not behind and willing to put his name behind, then we have a problem?”In the evening, it was usual suspects Tucker Carlson (with an assist from Barstool Sports) and Laura Ingraham, who once lambasted LeBron and Kevin Durant for having the audacity to have an opinion on anything outside of basketball. Ingraham, it should be noted, once dedicated an entire segment of her show to mocking LeBron while making the case that he didn’t possess the intelligence to comment on anything outside of the borders of a court.Now we should be clear that LeBron is not above criticism, but my own conversations with prominent voices in the athlete activism space over the last few days stresses the importance of context – and the danger of adhering to the rules of critics whose motives are in bad faith.Dr Harry Edwards, the Berkeley professor and civil rights activist whose seminal 1973 work Sociology of Sport remains an essential blueprint for athlete activism to this day, warns us to consider the source.“So, predictably, the detractors of those black athletes who have been speaking out against and protesting the injustice of 147 mostly unarmed black people being murdered each year under cover of the badge are now attacking those same black athletes for not speaking out against and protesting the China-Hong Kong debacle, a political stance if assumed by black athletes would parrot and serve the political interests of those who are so critical of their anti-injustice dispositions regarding the circumstances of African Americans.”Even more to the point was Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, the former NBA star whose own career was cut short after he refused to stand for the national anthem while playing for the Denver Nuggets in 1996 – a protest that presaged Kaepernick’s movement by a generation.“African Americans who are well informed in particular are not unaware of the hypocrisy of presidents, politicians and commentators now wanting athletes to speak for causes that ultimately promote US exceptionalism and imperialism, domestically and abroad,” Abdul-Rauf told me, “while at the same time blatantly ignoring, to the point of a deathly silence, the plight of African Americans and people of color in this country.”He continued: “Until we see a need for international solidarity, linking our struggles with those of others the strength we desire will forever be minimal and the achievement of social justice not realized. I have a major problem with people who play these type of games thinking we are this dumb to parrot what they want us to so that it benefits them while our problems are ignored. Quit trying to tell us how, when, where and what to say if you are not willing to pay attention to our life and death pleas for fairness and equality.”John Carlos, whose Black Power salute on the podium at the 1968 Olympics is one of the enduring images of the athlete activist movement, told me: “They want to say players and coaches have to speak now. No, they don’t have to do anything. We will no longer be your puppets. We will not let you speak through us. Freedom of speech goes both ways: you have the right to speak and the right to be silent.”Again, LeBron’s remarks are not above rebuke, even when judged by the higher standard he’s opted into by stepping up as a leader for social justice causes. But conservative critics like Carlson and Whitlock and Trump and Ingraham and Ted Cruz, who denigrate athletes for speaking up against the human rights violations happening on American streets and do the same when they don’t for issues halfway around the world, are trading in the very double standard they allege. These people only care about democracy and freedom of speech and allowing athletes to use their platforms to speak about injustice when the position taken is convenient for their agendas. If it’s not, they want athletes to shut up and dribble. And that is the essence of hypocrisy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28e94dc8c3c5458f8adc963f8692c245ef081ee6/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b1b2b180c9e53d866ad99a762f94dba","title":"tokyo olympics marathon switched north sapporo cooler climate athletics","story":"The Olympic marathon and race walking events during Tokyo 2020 will be moved to Japan’s northernmost island of Hokkaido from the capital due to worries about heat.Organisers seem eager to avoid a repeat of troubling scenes at the recent World Athletics Championships in Doha, where almost half the field failed to complete the women’s marathon because of sweltering heat and humidity.“Athletes’ health and well‑being are always at the heart of our concerns,” said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee. “The Olympic Games are the platform where athletes can give once‑in‑a‑lifetime performances, and these measures ensure they have the conditions to give their best.“Organisers had been looking for ways to protect athletes and spectators from Tokyo’s sweltering temperatures expected during the summer Olympics and Paralympic Games next year.

After the surreal scenes of the All Blacks not being No 1 (Wales were, then Ireland!) they enter the quarter‑finals back at the top of the rankings, rated by the bookies as twice as likely to win the tournament as the second favourites. Don’t be so sure. It goes without saying they remain the best when on form, but that cancelled game might well be more of a hindrance to them than anyone, given that their last meaningful fixture will have been four weeks before their quarter‑final against Ireland. At least Italy would have been semi-meaningful. These All Blacks are not invincible at the best of times. Current world ranking: 1The same concerns apply to England. Nobody should be under any illusion that the cancelled game will help them. Their draw had been perfect, a series of Tests neatly escalating in difficulty. But when the fourth rung was removed, quite a leap was created to a quarter-final with Australia. Otherwise, England are in good shape. Defence remains a big question-mark, but defence is so 2007. Only Wales seem to bother with it these days. In attack, England are as threatening as anyone. Off-the-cuff counterattacking remains the speciality of the All Blacks, but England have developed a variety of ways to undo defences, including at the start of games when everyone is fresh and there are no excuses. Current world ranking: 3In these curious times in which New Zealand are not necessarily miles ahead, a lot of people – uncomfortable with the idea of Wales, Ireland or, God forbid, England as likely candidates – have ventured South Africa as their tip. They won the Rugby Championship this year, after all (although no team has ever won that and the World Cup in the same year). They certainly boast as formidable a tight five as any, a pleasing blend of spark and ice at half-back, and Cheslin Kolbe. Oh, Cheslin Kolbe. Defensively, though, the 2007 vintage this is not. Current world ranking: 5Which brings us to the defensive masters. We have long been told that defences win these competitions — in which case, hand the gong to Wales now. There is a sense, though, that things have changed. Wales have embarked on quite the campaign of late, gathering a grand slam, a record winning run and the kudos of being No 1 in the world — and they’ve done it with scarcely a whiff of the sort of try to quicken the pulses back home. They’ve done it with scarcely a try full stop, registering 10 of them in that grand-slam campaign – the same as Italy. But they’re still here, they’re still winning. Current world ranking: 2Japan, meanwhile, are doing so much more than win rugby matches. They are dismantling all received wisdom about how this game should be played and by whom. The hateful notion of tiers one, two and three has been exploded. As successive members of the old guard are dispatched, what should really terrify rugby’s establishment is that this team hail from a country of 125 million whose economy is the third largest in the world. If rugby can bite even modestly into Japan’s national consciousness, everything changes. A new centre of gravity could emerge to rival the current black hole that is England and France. America next. Current world ranking: 7The world rankings have received a lot of ridicule of late, never more so than when Ireland attained top spot on the eve of this competition, despite a string of recent indignities to embarrass 2018’s grand slam winners. The truth is, though, the rankings are very tight now with no one having to do much to top them – and that feels about right. Here Ireland are, sixth on our list (fourth on World Rugby’s), but they are genuinely capable of winning this thing, given a realistic upturn in form. Rugby has never had so much competition among its top teams. Current world ranking: 4And here we have Australia, World Cup finalists last time and twice champions. They too, it should not be particularly contentious to assert, are capable of winning this with a run of form. There is something by-the-seat-of-the-pants about this lot, but they will be relishing a crack at England, who seem so highly regarded after their humiliation by this side four years ago. Barely a few weeks ago Australia put nearly 50 on none other than the All Blacks. They are a long way from favourites, but an Australian triumph cannot be ruled out either. Current world ranking: 6Dare we say the same of France? No, we dare not say anything about the French. This vintage is no different from any other – mutiny in the air, players sent home under suspicious circumstances, captains dropped, games won and nearly lost, chaos all round. And yet our eighth-ranked team are thrice finalists. Some of the rugby they have played has been devastating – and not just to themselves. They will look on Wales in the quarter-finals and shrug. Win there, and neither Japan nor South Africa would quite daunt them. They will not win the tournament, surely … but, well, you get the drift. They could. Current world ranking: 8A sobering few days, but let’s be clear: no team in the top 10 would have reacted any differently to the prospect of elimination without playing. They would sit comfortably in this top eight, but that no-show against Ireland will, and should, haunt them. Current world ranking: 9Fiji too would be worthy quarter‑finalists. They have produced an astonishing array of attacking talents — and that’s not counting all those they’ve supplied to other countries. Wins against Australia or Wales would not have flattered them. Defeat by Uruguay is borderline unfathomable. Current world ranking: 11Semi-finalists last time out, and here they are in 11th. This business of fielding the same team at international level as domestic isn’t working. They could have picked some overseas players but with what message to those who stay at home? A dilemma. Current world ranking: 10Better and better with each game – oh, what would a level playing field do for these Island teams? They finally clinched that win against USA, after a whisker away against France. There are 110,000 people in Tonga. That’s the population of Chesterfield. Current world ranking: 13Europe’s answer to the Pacific Islanders, but a natural affinity for the muscular gets them only so far without the flair. Still, the same questions apply: what might they become with regular exposure? There’s no sign of any solution to that conundrum. Current world ranking: 14Authors of the second biggest upset in World Cup history. Uruguay’s overturning of a 30-point handicap with the bookies against Fiji is second only to Japan’s 42-point handicap against South Africa four years ago. Against Wales, they flirted for a while with equalling the latter upset. Incredible. Current world ranking: 18No scope for them to progress or regress. Isolated in the middle of their pool, way below the top two, way above the bottom, third was all they were ever going to get, even with a bonus two points against the All Blacks. Current world ranking: 12Disappointing. Partly because expectations were high. USA had been rising steadily through the teens in those rankings, but they were flat in their opener against England and never quite discovered themselves. A Japan-USA final in 2043, anyone? Current world ranking: 17They will always, along with Fiji and Tonga, hold the moral high ground, such are the gifts they have bestowed on a rugby world that gives so little in return. Alas, here they gave their fair share of gifts to the opposition too. Current world ranking: 15They snuck in through the back door and found themselves opening the tournament against the hosts in Tokyo. Won a lot of friends with a feisty display in defeat, including the tournament’s opening try, but that was it for them and tries. Current world ranking: 20At one point their very participation was in doubt, World Rugby concerned about the integrity of Namibia’s governing body. No doubting that of Phil Davies and his happy band. They troubled teams rated far higher. A great shame their final game against Canada was cancelled. Current world ranking: 23The decline of Canada is one of World Rugby’s more perplexing dilemmas. The former quarter-finalists should not have fallen so low. Much hope is invested in America’s new domestic league and this will hopefully help revive them, but too soon for this World Cup. Current world ranking: 22"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5aaf0677b287598419cc087274a676884acc09/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9599f1fa929f14483844f791d3794efc","title":"automated messages welfare australia system","story":"In 12 months, Australian welfare payments were stopped an extra 1m times thanks to automated technologies. Money is stopped first and questions asked later, causing untold miseryBad news comes to Australia’s welfare recipients in different ways.Sometimes, the message comes in the post. More often than not, though, word arrives through a special email portal, or by text to a smartphone. The sender always says the same thing: “Your payments have been suspended.”It happened to Keelan two months ago. He got a notification on his MyGov account, the online portal he uses to receive emails from Centrelink, Australia’s social security agency.The 26-year-old has been surviving on Australia’s jobseekers’ payment, Newstart allowance, ever since his medical conditions – anxiety, depression and OCD – started affecting his studies.His payments – A$600 a fortnight – were automatically stopped because he missed a phone appointment. It mattered little that he was not in a great state at the time.“I wasn’t sure what day it was because my OCD was quite bad,” Keelan tells the . “I got a phone call that I didn’t register. It turned out to be Centrelink and they cut off my payments. And I didn’t hear from them again after that.”Keelan, who did not want his surname published, says he spent hours on the phone over several days trying to get his welfare payments back. Most of the money was delayed for about a week. He was broke and couldn’t afford his medication.When he doesn’t take his meds, “it sort of throws off my day-to-day function to the point where I can’t complete a sentence,” he says. “My condition just gets worse and I go into a downward spiral where I need to go into care sometimes.”These suspensions are becoming increasingly common and will be considered by the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, who is examining the impact of digital technology on social safety nets around the world.Australia’s welfare system is often touted by its politicians as the most efficient and the envy of the world.Bureaucrats and politicians alike have embraced technology and automation with open arms. As part of a sweeping digitisation push slated to finish in 2022, benefits claims are now conducted online. Since 2013, welfare recipients have been pushed away from Centrelink shop fronts and on to the MyGov online portal.The centre-right coalition government is already facing legal action over its Robodebt scheme, which critics say uses a flawed algorithm to accuse benefits recipients of owing a welfare debt. But there have been other, less-remarked-upon changes, too.Last year, the government overhauled the way it sanctions welfare recipients accused of gaming the system. In a briefing to the privately run job service agencies that administer the new policies, an official summed up the changes: “Processes will be automated as much as possible to simplify administration.”Welfare advocates say the consequences have been disastrous. In the space of a year, the new policy has increased the number of welfare payment suspensions to 2.7m.“There’s a shifting of decision-making that is increasing the amount of automatic suspensions,” says the policy analyst Simone Casey.Under the most recent changes, the government has prioritised welfare suspensions over sanctions, in which a person has their payments docked for doing the wrong thing. These penalties, which used to be applied manually by a staff member, have dropped significantly. Instead, a recipient’s money is cut off automatically until they satisfy their job agency consultant that they are committed to looking for work.Casey, who used to engage with the government regularly in her work as a policy analyst adviser to not-for-profit job agencies, says that over time consultants have been handed less decision-making power over how to penalise – or not – the welfare recipients they are employed to help.Consultants have less discretion when a welfare recipient does not turn up to an appointment or misses another compulsory activity. They enter a code into a system that automatically triggers a payment suspension.The same goes when the welfare recipient fails to report their income or confirm they met their job search requirements via digital channels.Money is stopped first, and questions are asked later. The idea is that this will encourage people to follow the rules.“In some cases it’s left single parents without money for food for their children over a weekend because they haven’t logged in and reported their attendance,” says Adrianne Walters, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre.“And so the computer says, ‘No payments’. And then that person is left without anywhere to turn until their employment service provider opens up again on the Monday.”The National Social Security Rights Network represents community legal centres who take calls daily from welfare recipients that feel wronged by the system.“We’re definitely seeing more people call up because of automation,” says Jai Manoharachandran, a policy officer at the network.“When you’re living paycheck to paycheck, every little bit counts. And the idea that you might have to try and stretch your income for a few days before you get back-paid, it’s incredibly stressful for clients. They often don’t understand why their payments have been suspended.”Rebecca Johnson, 39, lives in Perth, in Western Australia, with her 21-year-old son. He has autism and also receives government benefits. She says she “honestly can’t remember” how many times her payments have been suspended.Since the new policies were introduced, about 50,000 suspension notifications now go out to welfare recipients across the country each week.When they contact their job agency, the consultant decides whether or not they had a fair reason for missing their appointment. If not, they are given “demerit point”, which can lead to harsher penalties. has tracked the new system since it was rolled out, finding that the homeless and single parents are disproportionately impacted. In six months, 55,000 homeless people received a suspension yet there are only about 60,000 homeless people receiving welfare at any given time.On one occasion, Johnson says she had her welfare cut after she was given four phone appointments with her job agency over 10 days.“I was at work and they just kept changing them with no contact,” she says.“There was no contact as to what was really going on. Just I kept getting these text messages saying that you’ve got appointment on this day, you got an appointment on this day.”The last text in the chain, shown to the , says: “Your payment has been suspended for not attending your provider appointment. To restore payment you need to attend a provider appointment.”The government says payments are turned back on once people re-engage with the system. But observers say it doesn’t always work like this in practice.Manoharachandran tells the story of one client who was already broke when her welfare payments were suspended.“She didn’t have money for the train to go to her job service provider,” he says. “She had no money for food or other essentials. So basically, she needed to get the suspension lifted as soon as possible. She ended up riding the train without a ticket and picking up a $200 fine.“And then when she got to the provider, they initially told her they couldn’t see her that day and she’d have to come back the next day to re-engage and get that suspension lifted. She didn’t even have the money to get home. She’d already incurred a $200 fine getting there.”For Johnson, the suspensions mean stress and hoop-jumping at best. Other times, it’s much worse. “You virtually have no money left,” she says of living on Australia’s unemployment benefit, which is among the lowest in the OECD.The last time her payments were suspended, she had no money for the weekend. And it wasn’t even her fault: a system glitch with the digital app meant she could not report her income to Centrelink.“You try and do the right things, you still get punished,” she says. “That’s the way I see it.The most vocal critic of this system has been Rachel Siewert, a senator with the Australian Greens.“The system is geared to be very aggressive towards job seekers, and people looking for work,” she says. “This is what we predicted would happen given the way the system is set up.”Over time, people receiving benefits in Australia have been given more responsibilities. Increasingly, this involves using technology – an online portal or smartphone app – to regularly report information back to the government.The government has also established a trial for welfare recipients engaging with job agencies. In time, it hopes a large proportion of them will not go into an office for help and will instead deal with their consultant using an online platform.Siewert is not convinced it will work. “I’m not having a go at technology but that it can make it harder,” she says. “You’ve also got certain groups of people that don’t have the same digital skills.“I’m not saying older all older people don’t understand technology, but many of them don’t. They’re finding themselves unemployed, later in their career, they may have been involved in an industry that didn’t have to become particularly technically literate, and they are also being alienated through the approach.”The same goes for Johnson’s son, whose autism means he struggles to navigate the increasingly digital system. He sometimes forgets to report his income to Centrelink. That does not trigger a phone call asking him what happened, just a payment suspension.“I have to remind him so we don’t get paid for a day or two later until you report,” Johnson says.The government is convinced the new system is working. Despite the huge increase in welfare payment suspensions, it says most people end up having their payments restored before they are delayed.Moreover, the new system has one clear benefit in its eyes. It is expected to save a few hundred million dollars.Critics say the true cost is felt by people engaging with the system. Walters, of the Human Rights Law Centre, points to a study by researchers from the University of York that found welfare penalties were ineffective.“That’s that starting point, you’ve got a program that is causing the stress to Australian families,” she says. “And when you automate that programme, we automate the decision-making, you essentially turbo-charge those impacts.”Johnson’s phone and email are full of messages telling her about her suspensions. She argues she should at least have a phone conversation with someone before her income is stopped.But she’s used to getting those notifications now. What does she think when she gets the news?“Oh, I don’t know I probably just, ‘Again?’ There’s always something,” she says.“It’s never-ending. ‘What have I done this time?’ Or just another drama to deal with. ‘I don’t have time for this crap.’ That’s what I feel like.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33f61829ef42adaa9eaaac2d64ecdc80186ebe14/0_187_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=034c5b8adcfdbfa0f62b2156e0dab98b","title":"glitch india biometric welfare system starvation","story":"Claimants are given a 12-digit number linked to their data, and if something goes wrong they can be refused foodMotka Manjhi had been back and forth to the ration shop four or five times, his wife said, but on each occasion he returned empty-handed. His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly. What was to be done?In the past, Manjhi and other low-income Indians only needed papers to pick up subsidised grains to feed themselves. But the welfare system in India has undergone dramatic change.Each person claimingsupport is now required to have an Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit number that is linked to their biometric and demographic data. The scheme has grown so quickly since its introduction in 2009 that it now covers more than 1.2 billion people and is the world’s largest biometric identification system.The Indian government argued that this system would revolutionise welfare: computerised checks would stop fraudsters from siphoning off other people’s benefits, allowing more money to reach the poor. But campaigners say its design is flawed and it is riddled with technological glitches. They argue it has become a Kafkaesque nightmare that has caused misery for the very people it claims to protect.Despite the serious concerns raised by economists and poverty experts, the system kept on growing and is now involved in access to anything from a pension to medical reimbursements or disaster emergency relief. Activists say in some cases parents are wrongly being asked for an Aadhaar number in order to enrol their children in school.Even if a person is lucky enough to find out what has caused the disruption, this doesn’t mean the problem will be solved. “Officials at district level or lower district level may be able to tell you why your payment has stopped they may not be able to tell you how to fix it,” Khera said.In Majhi’s case, the problem of his unrecognised thumbprint was left unresolved as he couldn’t take the time to make the trek to the centre. Meals were missed – just a few to start, then more and more often – and Manjhi became extremely thin.On 22 May he collapsed outside the family home. Neighbours rushed to help as his wife, Alabati Devi, tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance took him to hospital but it was too late. He died aged 50.No one declared the cause of his death, but the family believe it was starvation. “When he came back from looking for work he said: ‘Give me food or I will die,’” said Devi. There was nothing to give him. Hours later he fainted. All he had eaten that day was a small portion of rice and toddy palm fruit, which grows nearby their home.“He was malnourished because of the lack of the food,” said Devi, who noted he had no other illnesses.The family was living hand to mouth, said Bijay Prasad Kapi, a social activist who has supported Devi and many others. “They didn’t have any food, they couldn’t afford to store any rice. They didn’t know where to get help.” Devi was entitled to a pension but this had not arrived in her account since January.The block development officer for Majhi’s neighborhood was not reachable and the supply officer declined to comment.Activists have tracked 13 cases in Jharkhand where people who were refused support due to aadhaar glitches have allegedly died of starvation. One was an 11-year-old girl. The death of Santoshi Kumari, whose family’s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017. Officials denied that Santoshi died of starvation and said her death was due to malaria. Other cases of alleged starvation deaths have also been denied by the government.Campaigners say the system continues to be fraught with problems. Fingerprints don’t scan properly, officials fail to offer timely assistance and internet coverage is too poor for the system to function.Pansure Murmu, who runs a ration shop in Jammu, said Aadhaar worked well on the whole, but she admitted the network signal was a problem. “We have to move the machine one or two kilometres to get the signal,” she said.Others have been known to take their customers to a hilly mound to get a signal for internet access. Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. “The local ration shop owners were not doing that,” he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.“Payments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,” said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. “With Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.”Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else’s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the inidual who was receiving her money.The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually “extremely negligible”, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn’t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the inidual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays. Alabati Devi’s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi’s death through the media.She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha – India’s poorest states. “Where is the dignity in all this? These programmes have been put in place to allow people to live a life of dignity, and you are reducing them to beggars.”Additional reporting by Mohammad Sartaj Alam"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d89e018123818009dd8d960f771b00fd768011/1243_257_3377_2027/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2915d6e5b47a39c033fd292c9b90c70c","title":"regina king beale street watchmen superhero hbo dc comics oscar actor","story":"The Oscar-winner is playing a cape-swishing superhero in HBO’s revamp of the epic comic book. She talks wage gaps, wardrobe woes and her dreams of becoming a dentistRegina King had a hard time convincing some of her friends about Watchmen, her new HBO series inspired by the DC comic book of the same name and featuring the kind of details that make some people run for the exits: time travel, kung-fu fighting, masks and thinly veiled political allegory. “Girl, don’t do this,” said one friend. King could only smile and agree.But we would all do well to watch King – in anything. At 48, she is in her prime. While filming Watchmen, King won the best supporting actress  Oscar for  If Beale Street Could Talk, based on the James Baldwin novel. For years, she has been turning out quietly devastating portraits – in the movies Jerry Maguire and Ray, in the TV show Southland – with little public recognition. Now she has her pick of roles. “I appreciate winning the Oscar,” she says, “but that’s not the ultimate goal. I should be able to use it as currency moving forward.”King was not familiar with the original Watchmen material, nor the 2009 Zack Snyder movie (her 23-year-old son Ian is more excited about this role than any of King’s previous parts). But once she read the script, she was enthused. In Damon Lindelof’s adaptation, the tale’s 1950s cold-war storyline is spun into a look at the rise of a white supremacist group in a parallel US. King plays Angela Abar, a cop with superhuman fighting skills and an amazing French Lieutenant’s Woman-style cape: not the kind of part she usually gets.King, who in a New York hotel room is slight and smiling, powers through the series like a wrecking ball. She tuned into the fantasy landscape pretty quickly, even quibbling with wardrobe over the practicality of each costume. Originally, her mask was so cumbersome it seemed to defy even the tenuous reality of a comic-book tale. “I was like, ‘This is not good for the superhero peripheral! I can’t see if something’s coming – you have to tell me!’ So our wardrobe designer had a great idea: what if it was painted on?” It was hell on her skin, but it’s dynamite on screen.Lindelof was co-creator of Lost and the recent HBO hit The Leftovers. Watchmen has that same compelling narrative, the story of men with bamboo torches trying to eliminate black people. In the current climate, this parallel America feels very like the real thing. One of Lindelof’s triggers, says King, was Ta-Nehisi Coates’s 2014 article for the Atlantic, The Case for Reparations, addressing the unacknowledged fall-out from slavery. She also cites “the way policing is happening here in the States with, particularly, black men.” To this end, Watchmen is, oddly, of a piece with Beale Street, Baldwin’s exposé of the split-screen reality in the US between white people and people of colour – although Watchmen doesn’t seem expressly political to King. With a laugh, she says: “Being black, it’s part of my life. What’s happened is that Trump has just emboldened people. They were always there, feeling the way they’ve been feeling, but now, oh my gosh. There are a lot of people – white friends I have – who have had this wedge in their families. They knew maybe a family member was a little less progressive, but whoa! Now they’re finding out their views were so far apart.”Meanwhile, the idea of white supremacy as a guerrilla force is not exactly fantastical, given the extent such militias play in US history. “It’s easy to pretend that something didn’t exist if you’re not talking about it,” says King. “Within our community, yes, we’re talking about it all the time, because we’re living it generation to generation. But for a lot of white Americans, ignorance is bliss. For them.”King grew up in California, and wanted to be a dentist. This was not a passing phase. She loved going to her dentist so much, it seemed for many years to be the only possible career path. “I would always hear horror stories about the dentist, but not mine. His dental assistant was his wife, Babe, and she had this white hair that looked like cotton candy. I always looked forward to going. I’d floss to impress him. He made the experience fun. He made me understand how important your periodontal situation is.” She bursts out laughing. “He had a great set of teeth and Babe had a great set of teeth! So whenever I would see people without a great set of teeth I’d be like, ‘Ew!’”Don’t ever live in Britain, I say. “Yeah, I know.” Again she hoots with laughter. “Not a lot of good teeth there.”King had acted in school, but it wasn’t until she got to theUniversity of Southern California that it became clear to her not only that dental work wasn’t in her future, but that what she should do was drop out to act. It amazes her now that she made this decision with “no information to back it up”. She simply knew it was the right thing to do, a strong intuition foreshadowing a steeliness that would become apparent 30 years later in her most famous roles. Her parents weren’t happy. “My mom is a teacher and showed her disappointment,” she says, “but not enough that it made me decide to go back.”She was so young and inexperienced that for years, in roles she took in movies such as Boyz N the Hood and Mighty Joe Young, she had no idea of pay scale, or whether she was receiving a fair income relative to others on set. “I wasn’t focused on that,” she says. “It wasn’t until I was in my 30s that I even stopped to consider the wage gap. It was something as simple as hearing a male actor say something – either about his per diem, or something else – and I was like, ‘Wait! Hold up – my part is way bigger than yours.’” No one talked about it in the early days? “Well, things have been designed so that we don’t.”King has been a supporter of Time’s Up, the campaign to equalise pay and conditions for women in Hollywood. “That’s why this is a pretty exciting time. If I’m blessed enough to have a granddaughter, she’ll come in knowing this is how it’s going to be. I feel like it’s diminishing it by calling it a movement. It’s witnessing a shift, a life change. That’s how I look at it.”Crucially, she says, expectations have changed: there’s a suspicion that, just as sexual harassment will come back to bite you, so will pay differences. “No one wants their filthy past, their dirty little secret, to come out. A lot of people in these positions of power – white men – don’t even realise it was a problem, or something you should feel embarrassed about.”King is glad she had a lot of solid success before she won the Oscar, playing supporting roles in big movies. “I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh, you were robbed with Jerry Maguire, or Ray.’ But I don’t think I would’ve had an appreciation for the art, in the way I do, if it had happened earlier.”Beale Street was a different experience. “Oh, gosh,” says King, who found it so personal that talking about it still makes her emotional. Astonishingly, it was the first movie adaptation of a Baldwin novel, a film that remained a quiet, literary piece despite the starriness of its cast – and of its director, Barry Jenkins, fresh from his Oscar win for Moonlight the previous year. For King, who played Sharon Rivers, the mother of a young woman whose fiance is wrongly imprisoned for rape, it was everything: a love story, an indictment of the criminal justice system, and part of the vast, untold history of black life in the US. “We’re in a time when film is so loud and the audience is looking for shocking. It’s hard to convince people that there is an audience out there that wants quiet stories.”So does she feel in her prime? “For the most part, body-wise, I don’t feel different than when I was in my 20s,” she says. “Only when I hurt something, because it takes so long to get back. But the wisdom and regard for what’s important is different now. In my 20s, that I-don’t-give-a-fuck attitude is great. It helps you go out on a ledge and let your feet dangle down and not even think about it.”Still, it is nothing compared with the thrill of having better judgment: “Being in your 40s and having the wherewithal to know, ‘Yeah, maybe not that ledge.’” She roars with laughter.• Watchmen is on HBO in the US from 20 October and on Sky Atlantic and Now TV in the UK from 21 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722323a17b6606cd0dc48cfc7ab752e67120392d/56_0_1212_727/master/1212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3262cb8979ba1520a373cf61e0f2abb","title":"david correia rudy giuliani associates campaign finance","story":"Prosecutors allege David Correia, 44, made outsized political donations to Republican candidates to advance business interestsA Florida man wanted in a campaign finance case involving associates of Rudy Giuliani is in federal custody after flying Wednesday to Kennedy airport in New York City to turn himself in, federal authorities said.David Correia, 44, was named in an indictment with two Giuliani associates and another man arrested last week on charges they made illegal contributions to politicians and a political action committee supporting Donald Trump. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is Trump’s personal lawyer.All the other defendants in the case were already in custody.Prosecutors said Correia, who owns a home with his wife in West Palm Beach, was part of efforts by co-defendants Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to leverage outsized political donations to Republican candidates and committees as part of an effort to advance their business interests.Both Parnas and Fruman have a history of business dealings with Giuliani. Prosecutors said that, among other things, the pair made campaign contributions with the intent of lobbying US politicians to oust the country’s ambassador to Ukraine. At the time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump’s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.Correia is accused of conspired with the other defendants, including Ukrainian-born US citizen Andrey Kukushkin, to make political donations to local and federal politicians in New York, Nevada and other states with the aim of trying to get support for a new recreational marijuana business.All four defendants were expected to appear Thursday in federal court in Manhattan.A lawyer for Correia is not yet listed in court records.Giuliani has said he had no knowledge of illegal donations and hadn’t seen any evidence that Parnas and Fruman did anything wrong.Correia is listed as the registered agent for a Florida corporation tied to a series of wire transfers prosecutors allege was part of an elaborate effort to hide the true source of funds used to make the donations.He posed with then congressman Pete Sessions in a 2018 photo taken inside the Texas Republican’s Capitol Hill office that Parnas posted on social media with the caption “Hard at work !!”The Associated Press reported last week that Sessions fits the description in the indictment of a congressman who prosecutors allege was part of a coordinated effort to remove the US ambassador to Ukraine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5531c2a3e77150c6d87b6e3b62b6d6b8ca26247/0_10_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed44e580ed2ec7e3dce9f15002f52468","title":"stop you cant pop prosecco pringles seized in italy","story":"250 tubes of wine-flavoured crisps taken in investigation into use of protected nameThe Italian agriculture minister, Teresa Bellanova, has pledged to fight against “identity theft” after hundreds of tubes of prosecco-flavoured Pringles were seized from a supermarket chain in the Veneto region.The supermarket had purchased the crisps, officially labelled “prosecco and pink peppercorn flavour”, from a marketing affiliate of Pringles in the Netherlands. The product is among the brand’s “Dinner Party” range.The name prosecco has been protected since being granted DOC (denomination of controlled origin) status in 2009 and can be used only if authorised by the region’s consortium of prosecco producers.“Identity theft must not be allowed,” said Bellanova. “The seizure testifies to the strong commitment of the ministry and the ICQRF, our authority which fights against food fraud and for the protection of quality, to fight against the usurpation of Italian protected names.”Luca Zaia, the Veneto president who often wages war against anything that could harm the image of the region’s famous sparkling wine, shared a photograph of the offending can of Pringles on Facebook, superimposed with the message: “NO!”“We can no longer tolerate the use of a protected name without authorisation,” Zaia wrote.“Just think,” he continued. “Yesterday hundreds of cans of prosecco crisps, made up of ingredients including an unspecified ‘prosecco powder’, were seized from a chain of supermarkets in Veneto, purchased from a Dutch company … this is why we have been insisting for years that we need to protect our excellences from fraud, abuse and anything ‘Italian-sounding’, as it primarily damages honest producers who promote quality and the territory.”Prosecco and pink peppercorn Pringles were first launched last autumn as limited-edition Christmas snacks, selling in the UK, where the drink is wildly popular, in Asda and Tesco.The investigation in Italy, which was carried out by the ICQRF unit in the prosecco-producing area of Conegliano, led to the seizure of 250 tubes. “But the investigation does not stop,” said Stefano Vaccari, the unit’s chief. “We could eventually find thousands of boxes as other withdrawals are under way and the company has also undertaken to withdraw the product.”Pringles said in a statement: “The prosecco and pink peppercorn variant was produced in 2018 as a limited edition for the Christmas holiday period. We used prosecco DOC as an ingredient in the aroma and the use of the name of the product on the packaging was designed in line with DOC guidelines and European regulations. We have no plans to produce this variant in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33544976ccfa643fa6a3e6a739e808b3a6b5214b/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8d51d4e7f6c9c26c78f1395502112f0 1010w","title":"could you be an adoptive parent","story":"What does it take to raise a child who has been adopted? We asked adoptive parents to share their advice“You don’t have to be a superhero,” says Sue Armstrong Brown, chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, the leading voice of adoptive families.Armstrong Brown believes that many of the characteristics adoptive parents require are the same as those all parents need. “Warmth, openness and a willingness to accept the unknown are key,” she says. “Adopters need to be emotionally mature, have resilience and problem-solving skills and the ability to prioritise family relationships. And a good sense of humour is essential.”Adopted children’s early experiences mean they can often struggle with relationships and day-to-day life. Many have suffered abuse or neglect, all have been separated from their birth families and most have spent time in the care system. They need love, understanding and patience to help them overcome their difficulties and go on to lead confident, happy lives.Although it can be challenging, being an adoptive parent is also hugely rewarding and adopters provide some of the UK’s most vulnerable children with the stable homes they so desperately need.Heather and her husband, Dan, adopted Miles 15 months ago when he was just over a year old. Heather considers empathy to be the most important quality in an adoptive parent. “That is probably the biggest one,” she says. “Really understanding where children are coming from.“I think it’s important being able to admit to them if you don’t get something right,” Heather continues. “Adopted children can mistrust adults even if they don’t know where that comes from. Some have never had an adult meet their basic needs.”Dan and Heather were an “adoption first” couple, meaning that they had not experienced infertility, but went straight for adoption to start their family.“At the time, I was working with children who were in care, and for some of the children their plan was adoption. It didn’t feel right to us as a couple to have a baby when we knew so many children were waiting for families,” says Heather.The fact that she was already working in nurseries and children’s centres meant that there was no mystique for her around adoption. Dan had his reservations at first but once he went to a group for prospective adopters, those feelings disappeared.“He realised they were just children, there was nothing to be frightened of. They just needed a stable, loving home,” Heather says.They also knew they had to work together as a couple, supporting each other, being flexible and communicating about any challenges. “The challenges that adoptive children bring are the same as for all children, but the approach has to be different,” she says. “Miles sometimes struggles with separation so it’s about building up trust.”Tanya Killick is a project worker at Adopteens, an online community for adopted young people aged 11 to 18 living in Yorkshire and the Humber region. She believes adopters with teenagers should be open to exploring their children’s pasts. “It’s about flexibility around the teenagers’ emotional needs,” she says. “An understanding of where they have come from is crucial in helping them form a strong sense of their own identity.”Education poses many challenges to adopted children and their families. While GCSEs, A-levels, and going to college can be stressful for many young people, those who are adopted can find these life stages even more difficult. “They need a lot more support in school,” says Killick. “Adoption is not just a point in time, it is a part of you forever.”Claire is a single adoptive parent from north-east England who has two daughters, now aged five-and-a-half and three. She was in her early 30s when she first thought about adopting. “I felt ready to have kids and wasn’t in a relationship at the time. One of my parents was adopted, so it was something that I grew up with. It just seemed like the right way to do it.”When she began to research adoption, she realised many of the children in the looked-after system had been exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. Claire made the conscious decision to openly accept that and look for sources of support after she had adopted. Both her children have foetal alcohol syndrome and have benefited from specialist therapies. Claire has been able to deal with the resulting challenges as they arise. “It just requires thinking in a different way, a different sort of parenting,” she says.Armstrong Brown reiterates that adoption can be uniquely fulfilling. “Adoptive parents find they have a deep love for their children that really enhances their lives, despite the challenges,” she says.“If you are interested, and feel drawn to adopt, just make an enquiry – it doesn’t commit you to anything.”If you are interested in finding out more about adoption, contact First4Adoption on 0300 222 0022 or visit first4adoption.org.ukyoucanadopt"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052254.1571210419!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ticket scramble in japan as irish fans seek swaps for new zealand game","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCork man Cian Alcock at An Solas bar in Tokyo.

As a diehard rugby fan, Cian Alcock moved to Tokyo and got a job pulling pints to support his World Cup adventure.Unfortunately, when he handed over €1,000 for a premium ticket to the quarter-final he picked the wrong game.It was a mistake repeated by thousands of Irish fans. Those expecting the team to top their pool and face South Africa in the quarter-final booked their seats well in advance. In the end, Japan’s wins over Ireland, and\u0026nbspScotland last weekend, means Ireland face New Zealand instead.Even if the Irish players rally to a World Cup upset on Saturday, many of the travelling fans are unlikely to be there.This Friday offers some hope. A meet-up between Irish and Japanese fans appears to have been organised in order to swap tickets - Japan now face South Africa so it should be a win-win for fans but nobody is taking anything for granted.“I have spent a fortune. I was only going to go to one game,” said Alcock who previously based himself in New Zealand for the 2011 World Cup.“I have spent €1,000 for a premium ticket but it’s for the wrong game. Disaster.”Like everybody else in the same predicament, the Cork native has looked at the rugby swap Facebook page where everyone is trying to offload their tickets. There is “very little chance” he says with an air of resignation.PandemoniumIn the first five hours of a quiet Tuesday evening shift in Tokyo at least a dozen fans came into An Solas asking, he says.Exchanges between those who have tickets for the Japan versus South Africa game, but who wish to see the Ireland game, and fans on the other side of the conundrum now appears the most likely option.The Facebook Ticket Exchange page has advertised a three hour event this Friday while activity online has already pitched huge demand against limited supply.Those with, and looking for, tickets have been advertising what they have and what they want. By Tuesday evening more than 1,000 people had interacted with the page.The like-for-like, transactional nature of where fans find themselves is illustrated in the posts. “We have two category D tickets seated together for Sunday’s Japan Vs South Africa game in Tokyo and want to swap for two seated together tickets for Ireland Vs New Zealand on Saturday,” wrote one.The site warns hopeful fans against dealing with certain traders while other titbits of advice includes bringing passports to an exchange as identification and only trading in tickets bought through the official World Cup website. Others warn against making money transfers, sticking instead to face-to-face deals.The stakes are high given the figures quoted on resale websites. On Viagogo, single tickets were selling for between €795 and €2,040 on Tuesday evening. The site warned they were swapping hands quickly, unlike other World Cup fixtures, and in one hour almost 1,000 people had viewed what was on offer.On the Stubhub site, advertised prices ranged from €727 to €2,500.

Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonEPAThe Irish Government has been praised in Paris for its conduct throughout the Brexit saga.“Dublin in a position of strength,” said a headline in Le Monde following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s meeting with prime minister Boris Johnson last Thursday.The UK repeatedly made the mistake of trying to “bilateralise” Brexit negotiations, an adviser to French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday, while pointing out that EU unity did not preclude contacts between political leaders. For example, Macron spoke to Johnson on the telephone on Tuesday morning.“When Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar saw each other a few days ago, Ireland played the European game perfectly,” the adviser at the Élysée said. “Mr Johnson made political overtures, and it was referred to the 27 for negotiations. It’s not Mr Varadkar or the Irish team negotiating with the British today. It’s Michel Barnier and his team.”‘Supported’The Élysée sees EU solidarity with Ireland as a shining lesson of the benefits of EU membership. “It is the profound meaning of the EU project that a member state which is in difficulty, whether it be an attack, an economic threat or a political difficulty, must be supported by the others,” the adviser said.“If belonging to the EU means anything, it is that there must be no ambiguity or hesitation about protecting the fundamental interests of a member state, and that is valid whatever the size of the country. It is valid for a country of five million inhabitants, like Ireland.”The fact that the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the EU’s only land border with Britain was “the second reason why Ireland was at the heart of the negotiations”, the adviser added.Though the Élysée hoped for an imminent agreement, the adviser warned that the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday must not be “a catch-up session or the continuation of technical or detailed negotiations. It will be the moment to endorse or formalise a political agreement, but in no event a nocturnal extension of tough negotiations”.Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will co-ordinate their positions at a Franco-German cabinet meeting in Toulouse on Wednesday, where they will be joined by their ministers for defence, foreign affairs, European affairs, finance, culture and the interior.The meeting will focus on trade tensions with the US and co-operation in industry and innovation, in particular artificial intelligence and military procurement. Paris and Berlin are developing a combat aircraft and a battle tank together.Toulouse is the site of the Airbus 350 assembly line, considered one of the most successful Franco-German projects.International eventsFranco-German relations are often rendered difficult because of international events external to them, the adviser said. “It’s the situation that is difficult, not France and Germany. ”Macron’s approach has been to attempt to reach compromise on areas of discord, such as the reform of the euro zone, not to paper over disagreement.The French president believes “there is no alternative or possible substitute for the Franco-German relationship. It is irreplaceable,” the adviser continued. But, at the same time, it is “not an exclusive relationship”. Under Macron, “France is working much more with other partners, for example the Netherlands and central Europe, than before.”Macron received a stinging rebuke from the European Parliament when it vetoed the appointment of Sylvie Goulard as a member of the European Commission. Macron had secured a weighty portfolio for her, including the internal market, industry, defence, space, digital technology and culture.The Élysée said the attributes of the portfolio reserved for France must not change. Macron wants the “political instability” of the parliament, which has no clear political majority, to be addressed before he chooses a new commissioner.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Independent Premium.For some actors, dedication to their craft knows no bounds.There has been a long history of performers who have got so stuck into their roles that they’ve taken things too far, whether they’ve injured themselves or frightened their co-stars on set.While method acting is considered a technique adopted by the greatest actors, there have been many examples of such instances where reining it in could have been beneficial.It won\u0027t be much of a surprise to see certain names here – Daniel Day-Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix are indeed included – but others (Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher, for example) may make you look twiceBelow is a compilation of 21 actors who took certain roles\u0026nbspso seriously things\u0026nbspgot out of hand.Created with Sketch.21 actors who took their roles so seriously it got out of hand Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011). Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison\u0027s songs and had everyone call him Jim on set of the 1991 biopic.Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin.For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is moving away from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets. Mr Solomon has been in charge since October 2018 and is known for his hobby of spinning records at nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol.Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.At the same time, Mr Solomon is conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.The bank’s earnings per share fell to $4.79 in the quarter ended on 30 September from $6.28 a year earlier.Total net revenue fell 6 per cent to $8.32bn.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will also be worn by the first ever woman to walk on the Moon, who will head there as part of the Artemis mission.Nasa unveiled two prototypes, one white model designed for exploring outside of the spacecraft on spacewalks, and a second orange suit for high-risk activity on the inside, such as launch and returning to Earth.Amy Ross, a spacesuit engineer, said the new Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) for outside use has been made more flexible than before, making it easier for astronauts to move and bend.It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\u0026nbspZippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit, she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC.There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.We found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s, former Nasa scientistIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.You\u0027ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u0027re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past, said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.The Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise.Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.Kenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.Funding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year\u0026nbsphe shut down\u0026nbsphis company\u0027s Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\u0026nbspaccounts and said Wetherspoon was going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business.It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion, he added.The author of the parody Tim Martin perhaps came to the same conclusion: the account has been dormant for more than 18 months.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the opportunity arises I would buy new trains on more favourable terms, but we will inherit a leasing arrangement that will be sustained for some time to come, and I have never said anything other than that.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

It had yellowish brown fur, powerful jaws and a pouch for its young like a kangaroo.Among eight sightings in the past three years was one from a couple from Western Australia visiting the island of Tasmania in February, who said they saw one of the creatures crossing the road.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created.

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier.It started to bounce and thats when remember it tilting – I was worried about coming out but thats the last thing I remember thinking.I remember the sensation of falling out, but I dont remember what I was thinking. There wasn’t a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once.I just remember seeing silver, asit was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didnt know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.“People thought I was dead.”Jade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream.People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasnt a dream and thats when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move.I thought Id lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled.Jade said she does not normally go on bigger rides, but her friend had persuaded her to go on it shortly after they arrived on the evening of Monday, October .The ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago.She added: The barrier must have come free, and when that happened my le was left relying on the clasp and buckle of an old seat belt. How can that be right Police have been investigating the accident that happened on the Airmaxx .Jade said: I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for le, so I do feel lucky in a way.Jade, who had recently left her job as a barmaid, now fears she might lose the new job she was due to start this week in a call centre.She said: My face is still really swollen, I cant smile, it worries me that my mouth will never feel the same again, I also have a big gash on my chin which was sewn up in surgery.She is now being supported by her solicitor at Hudgell Solicitors, but said her main aim is to find out exactly what happened and for any safety improvements that need to be made, to be made - not just compensation.Becci Ashfield, from Hudgells, said: This is quite simply something which should never happen and a full and transparent investigation is now needed to bring answers as to how and why Jade came to be thrown from the ride and suffer her injuries.Jade said: If I could have that ride scrapped and put out of business, never to be used again but I didnt get any compensation then at least Ive achieved something and saved someone from losing a le or losing their child or going through what Ive gone through.If the ride came back next year I would be very very angry.Hull Fair bosses say thrill seekers have more chance of being struck by lightning in Sainsburys than being thrown off a ride.Garry Leach, who is chairman of the Showmen’s Guild, says ride operators are devastated by what happened on the Airmaxx  and that they were doing all they could to assist the Health and Safety Executive, which is leading the investigation.The girl that fell off the ride has a broken jaw and ribs, which is not good and we hope that she will have a swt recovery.Mr Leach said he could not confirm the ride is the actual ride which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia, but did say it was exactly the same type as the one that operated in Australia.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and Putin has taken full advantage of the situation.The Russian leader brokered a deal between bloodthirsty tyrant Bashar al-Assad and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forceswho were abandoned by the firebrand US President.As Assad’s Syrian forces took full control of Manbij – under two hours drive north east of Aleppo – the Wagner Group seized a US military base in the city, it has been reported.In February , the privately-funded militia first came to prominence when  of its members attacked the SDF in northeast Syria.Whether the Moscow-backed troops realised a number of American military advisers were part of the Kurdish group is unclear.The assault – which lasted for four hours – was met with a barrage of US airstrikes which killed or injured around  of the Russians.According to Foreign Policy, that fiasco resulted in the Wagner Group having its “wings clipped” by the Kremlin.The current extent of its power and operations within Syria is not known – and rival Russian militias have emerged in recent years.But the Wagner Group’s influence in modern war zones, across four dferent continents, is undeniable and frightening.The company, whose members are mostly ex-service personnel, has fought clandestinely in support of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and in Libya where they backed General Khala Haftar overthrow the UN-backed government.In their Venezuela deployment, they reportedly flew in two chartered aircraft to Havana, Cuba in January, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to the troubled socialist country.Their task was to protect embattled President Nicolás Maduro from any attempt by opposition sympathisers in his own security forces to detain him, Reuters reported.Press freedoms in Putins Russia are notoriously compromised and some reporters who have attempted to investigate Wagner have ended up dead.The mercenary army was thrust into the spotlight last year when three Russian journalists were killed in Central African Republic while probing the group.While authorities in Moscow claim the documentary filmmakers, whose bullet-riddled bodies were left at the side of a road, were killed in a random robbery - their colleagues claim known associates of the Wagner Group were involved in their murders, reports Time.And one news outlet, which reported on the activities of the shadowy firm, claim their staff have been threatened and harassed.Proekt, an independent Moscow-based online news outlet which specialises in investigations, began to publish a series of articles in March looking into the role of the group.Around the same time editor-in-chief Roman Badanin said his journalists began to receive emailed threats of physical retribution for their work.Unknown people tried to break into his staff’s personal accounts on Facebook, the Telegram messenger service and Google mail, he said, and one of his journalists was followed in the street by an unknown man who filmed her with a video camera.“This is all simply an attempt to make us nervous, to distract from our journalistic work, to make it clear that we’re under surveillance and that they’re watching us,” Badanin told Reuters in an interview.Badanin said he could not prove who was behind the harassment campaign, which he said peaked last month when Proekt ran an investigation into Wagner’s apparent activities in Libya.Proekt did not complain to the police over the incidents, he said, saying he had instead decided to speak out publicly to draw attention to the threats.Russian private military contractors use a defence ministry base in southern Russia containing barracks that were built by a company linked to businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, it was reported in April.The US imposed sanctions on Prigozhin after it accused him of trying meddle in its  presidential election and the  congressional elections.Prigozhin has denied any links to Wagner and has declined to comment on the allegations, calling them a “private matter” for the US Treasury.According to recent figures, the global market for private security will reach £ billion - around five times the UK defence budget.A report for the foreign policy think-tank Chatham House said: “Increasingly arms and power are held in private hands, instead of the state.”“We’re seeing the growth of lethality among private companies who are not even in the shadows,” said McFate, now a professor of strategy at the National Defense University and Georgetown University in Washington DC.They are one of the biggest security threats of the st century.“They’re not going to take over western Europe or North America but they can go to sub-Saharan Africa and then the Middle East and take over and sell natural resources.McFate imagines a future when wars will be fought by private armies battling on behalf of the super-rich.“Say one oligarch would fight an oil company and they hire mercenaries and states would be by-standers in that war,” he said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five more sets of twins followed — along with four sets of triplets and five sets of quadruplets.Three years ago, however, the -year-old Ugandan was abandoned by her husband, leaving her to support their surviving  children alone.This has thrown her family into poverty.She lives with her children in four cramped houses made of cement blocks and topped with corrugated iron in a village surrounded by coffee fields  miles north of Kampala.Now , doctors have taken action to stop Mariam having more children.She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside.Her epic run of pregnancies began after her first sets of twins were born.When she went to the doctor it was noted that she had unusually large oies. He advised her that birth control like pills might cause health problems.Yet the children kept coming... and coming.Family sizes are at their largest in Africa.In Uganda, the fertility rate averages out at . children per woman, one of the continents highest, and more than double the global average of . children, according to the World Bank.But her -child family is probably the countrys biggest brood.Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, told the Daily Monitor that the most likely cause of Nabatanzi’s extreme fertility was hereditary.He said: “Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate — releasing multiple eggs in one cycle — which signicantly increases the chance of having multiple births. “It is always genetic”Her last pregnancy, three ago, had complications.It was her sixth set of twins and one of them died in childbirth, her sixth child to die.Then her husband — often absent for long stretches — abandoned her. His name is now a family curse.Nabatanzi refers to him using an expletive.I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering, she said during an interview at her home, hands clasped as her eyes welled up.All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money.Desperate for cash, Nabatanzi turns a hand to everything: hairdressing, event decorating, collecting and selling scrap metal, brewing local gin and selling herbal medicine. The money is swallowed up by food, medical care, clothing and school fees.On a grimy wall in one room of her home hang proud portraits of some of her children graduating from school, gold tinsel around their necks.Her eldest child Ivan Kibuka, , had to drop out of secondary school when the money ran out.He said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her,”Nabatanzis desire for a large family has its roots in tragedy.Three days after she was born, Nabatanzis mother abandoned the family: her father, the newborn girl and her five siblings.She just left us, said Nabatanzi sombrely, as some of her ragged children played on the dirt floor while others did chores.After her father remarried, her stepmother poisoned the five older children with crushed glass mixed in their food.They all died.Nabatanzi escaped because she was visiting a relative, she says.I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant. I was told by relatives what had happened, she said.She grew up wanting to have six children to rebuild her shattered family.Providing a home for  children is a constant challenge.Twelve of the children sleep on metal bunk beds with thin mattresses in one small room with grime-caked walls. In the other rooms, lucky children pile onto shared mattresses while the others sleep on the dirt floor.Hyperovulation can occur naturally or be stimulated via hormone treatments for the purposes of egg donation in third-party reproduction.Under normal conditions, when more than one egg is released, the chances of conceiving fraternal twins or triplets is increased.Stimulated hyperovulation involves several drugs and the careful monitoring of hormone levels and oian status using an ultrasound.Once mature, follicles are punctured during the egg retrieval procedure and evaluated for quality before being used for in vitro fertilization.Source: Repropedia Older children help look after the young ones and everyone helps with chores like cooking.A single day can require  kilograms of maize flour, Nabatanzi says. Fish or meat are rare treats.A roster on a small wooden board nailed to a wall spells out washing or cooking duties.On Saturday we all work together, it reads.Having endured such a hard childhood herself, Nabatanzis greatest wish now is for her children to be happy.I started taking on adult responsibilities at an early stage, she said.

However, it’s a quick out, not something that will include walk-throughs, etc everything is aboutout with as much as possible of our things while destroying any sensitive equipment that cannot be moved.”Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria and effectively hand over control of the north of the country to Assad and Russia has been widely criticised on both sides of the US political aisle.This week, the US President tweeted: “Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China or Napoleon Bonaparte.“I hope they all do great, we are , miles away!”On Sunday, Assads Russian-backed Syrian government forces swept into Kurdish-administered areas to shield them against Turkey.Despite the Syrian and Russian deployments, Turkey insists it would capture Manbij - setting up the potential for a bloody battle to come.Asked on Sky NewsTurkeys military was willing to fight Assads army, Vice President Fuat Oktay said, We hope its not going to happen.But again we are determined to get control over Manbij.Mortar fire from Manbij killed two Turkish soldiers and wounded seven others on Tuesday, the Turkish Defense Ministry said.Later, a battalion of around  Turkish troops along with armoured vehicles crossed near Manbij and Kobani.Kobani, a border town, is not yet secured by Syrian forces - and could act as a stronghold from which Turkey plans to attack.Farther east on the border, Turkish and Kurdish forces were in heavy battles over the town of Ras al-Ayn, captured by Turkey days earlier.US troops had outposts in Manbij since  - when they went in to avert a battle over the town between Turkish and Kurdish fighters.Now Russia has taken on that role - with Moscows troops patrolling front lines between Turkish and Syrian army positions.Alexander Lavrentyev, Moscows envoy for Syria, said on Tuesday that no one is interested in fighting between Syrian and Turkish forces.He told Russian state news agencies that Moscow is not going to allow it.In the first week of the Turkish assault, at least  fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been killed.There were another  fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian factions killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.It added at least  civilians have been killed in Syria.A US official said the approximately , US troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are very excited about this - although also very anxious for the next part of Harry’s Journey xxxxx’. Harry had to have shunts fitted into his brain in June to remove the excess fluid that was building there. Melanie says that procedure took Harry and her family to their lowest ebb yet. In one agonising Facebook post, Melanie revealed: Harry woke up crying, wanting to go home, saying he hates his le, and asking why do bad things always happen to me  Our hearts are completely breaking. I have watched him go through so much, and it doesn’t get any easier.    In July she added: Today has been a tough day!! It’s heartbreaking to watch - he’s been through so much, and continues to go through so much on a daily basis! Now, as Harry prepares to ring a bell at Addenbrooke’s signalling the end of this round of chemo, Melanie faces an anxious wait to discover what happens next. Harry is due a new MRI scan in October which will determine the next treatment. The youngster has already been denied by the NHS’ proton therapy commissioning  that decides which patients receives the treatment. They argued that proton therapy was not appropriate for Harry at this time owing to the complications in his brain.    And while Melanie accepts that decision, she feels Harry will fit the clinical criteria for proton therapy in the future - but fears that because he’s been rejected once, he’ll be rejected again. She’s instead hoping to pay for proton therapy privately at a treatment centre abroad and has already managed to raise £, of a £, target. Melanie said: Harry’s diagnosis is extremely rare - Addenbrooke’s oncologists say they’ve never seen what Harry has in his brain before - and we have to take every day at a time. I feel the tumour in Harry’s spine would be best treated with protons. He’ll definitely need proton therapy in the future. But because we’ve already been rejected by the NHS, I worry we’ll never get it.    Which is why we’re attempting to crowdfund for future treatment. Just the other day, someone anonymously donated £,. I have no idea who did it, but it’s amazing. People are amazing. AndHarry does eventually get accepted for proton therapy on the NHS, every penny we’ve raised will be donated to the charities who’ve helped us so far. The first ever NHS proton therapy centre opened at the Christie Hospital in Manchester last year while a second NHS facility is due to launch at the University College Hospital, London, next year - at a combined cost of £million. But they will only be able to treat around  patients each year - the vast majority being children.    And European proton beam therapy expert Dr Jiri Kubes, medical director of the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, Czech Republic, says the treatment can be highly beneficial when it comes to treating paediatric cancers. He added: Unlike standard photon radiation, protons release only a small amount of energy as they pass through the healthy tissues. Just before the end of the proton’s trajectory, the tissue absorbs most of the energy, and there is a sharp increase in the dose to the tumour, followed by a subsequent sharp decrease beyond the tumour. And by sparing the healthy tissue we can improve the quality of le of pediatric patients after treatment, particularly when it comes to secondary tumours. It will also be the case, however, that many UK patients who want proton therapy are not given access to it through the NHS.    While the NHS acknowledges the benefits of Proton Beam Therapy, and is building its own centres, they will still only be able to treat a fraction of those who might benefit from it, while many people will be turned down for the treatment because of the very limited indication criteria. There’s still a long way to go before patients in the UK have widespread access to it.

Claire Willis, , was on holiday in Turkey when she patted a towel to her face after getting out the shower. The mum-of-two said she felt a pop and rushed to the mirror fearing her eyeball had actually fallen out the socket. Everything was blurry and her eye was red, so she rushed to hospital where medics told her sheaposs perforated her cornea, and told her to fly straight home.  Infection set in - forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open - and after nine days in hospital she had to have her right eye removed Claire said she looked like an extra from The Walking Dead and has to wait until the socket heals so she can get a prosthetic. Claire from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: Tim and I were getting ready in the hotel room to go meet friends, and as itaposs really hot in Turkey, I had a shower to refresh myself. I was drying myself in the bathroom when I just felt this pop in my eye, followed by extreme blurry vision and an excruciating amount of pain. I thought my eyeball had actually popped out of my socket, thataposs how painful it was.    I raced to the mirror and I couldnapost see any blood or anything - it just looked red and sore and everything was blurry. Tim rushed me to a local hospital and a doctor told me that I had perforated my cornea and that I needed to go back to the UK. I was devastated, and I just couldnapost understand how my le had come to this or where to go from here. Speaking after the op, she added: After the bandages came off, I had to cope with how I looked and the reality hit me. I looked like an extra from The Walking Dead, and I even left my cleaning job at a school because of how it looked - I didnapost want to scare the kiddies. I was having anxiety issues in public, which really isnapost like me. I had to learn alone how to cope with a half amputated eye - it was sticky on the lids and I was scared to clean it in case I knocked the cosmetic shell out.    I never hid my eye though. I didnapost wear sunglasses, Iaposve just worn my everyday glasses and I know itaposs not forever, itaposs only until the prosthetic eye is fitted. I fought my demons, and every day, I pushed myself to go out and slowly but surely, I started feeling more confident. Claire and Timothy, , have been to Turkey every year for the past  years. It was the first day of their annual break in July when tragedy struck after Claire showered in their hotel room in preparation of going to meet friends. She felt a popping sensation in her right eye, leading to a horric amount of pain and a cloudiness of her vision. Bin man Timothy rushed his blinded we to the local hospital where an examination revealed that Claire had perforated her cornea. Devastated Claire was advised tohome to the UK immediately for medical attention and within hours, she was on a flight home with a huge bandage over her poorly eye. She said: Weaposd only been in Turkey for a few hours when I hurt my eye, and we didnapost get to enjoy any of our holiday before I had my accident. My vision had turned cloudy after I felt the pop, but then everything started going dark, and by the time we got to the Turkish hospital, all I could see was blurry lights.  Iaposve suffered with dry eyes in the past and just used eye drops, but never experienced anything like this. I was heartbroken when the doctor told me to go back to the UK, but I knew it was for the best. Thomas Cook were amazing, our hotel rep came straight to the hospital and got us on the next flight home. My eye was all bandaged up so I could fly, which was mortying, but I just wanted to get to the hospital and get it all sorted so I could book a replacement holiday. Claire went straight to Royal Stoke University Hospital when she landed where doctors were shocked to see how infected her eye had become during the flight. Her right eye was fused shut with infection, forcing doctors to clamp her eyelids open to get a look at her eyeball which had turned completely yellow. Claire spent the next nine days in hospital as doctors tried to fight the infection, but it was no use, and the suggestion of amputation was made. She said: I felt so isolated in the hospital, and when they suggested amputation, I was totally against the idea. My dad ended up convincing me to have the eyeball amputated, and although I was devastated at the idea, I was in so much pain that I knew it needed to be done. There was no saving my sight, but the surgeon decided to perform a partial removal of my eyeball rather than a full one. He removed the middle of my eye - the retina and cornea - and fitted a cosmetic shell over the lens of my eye. Claireaposs surgery was a success, and she was allowed tohome just one day after her operation.

Francois Graftieaux, , who has twice requested a DNA sample from the Queen without success, says his family were cut from the Royal bloodline in the early s following the alleged illicit tryst. He claims his father, Pierre-Edouard, was born out of an affair between the-then Prince of Wales and his granny Marie-Leonie Graftieaux - a French seamstress. But Francois alleges that Pierre-Edouard never found his way to the throne after the king abdicated, due to pressure from the Royal Family and the British Government.    This meant his family lost land, titles and wealth - and now heaposs looking for his gran to be included in the history books. Under English law, the Royal Family cannot be prosecuted under criminal law nor sued through the civil courts. But Francois believes a civil action can be brought against Buckingham Palace itself, which serves as the monarchaposs administrative headquarters. The retiree, who bears a striking resemblance to Edward, his claimed late grandfather, said that he has absolutely no interest in compensation.    He is instead looking for closure and for the history books to be rewritten as necessary to reflect his familyaposs place in the sovereigntyaposs lineage - as he has no children of his own. He said: In the s, the true line of succession was unlawfully concealed to block the Graftieauxs from their place in history. Whilst my father and I would have had no direct claim to the throne on account of Edwardaposs abdication, which also precluded his descendants from becoming King, the Graftieauxs would have become nobility at the very least. As the last of my family of Graftieauxs, I will take whatever action is possible and necessary to protect our legacy and to shed light on one of the greatest Royal sex scandals in living memory.    He has requested a DNA sample from the Queen on two previous occasions without success, in  and .  This week, Francois, who now lives in Portugal, wrote to Buckingham Palace for a third time to ask for help. He now says that,this latest plea is ignored, he may be forced to take legal action to force an investigation, possibly under the broad remit of the Human Rights Act.    He said: I am not asking the Palace for money, title or power but merely to ascertain the identity of my grandfather and the circumstances surrounding my fatheraposs birth. If the Palace again refuses to cooperate, which I strongly suspect it will, then I am happy to seek legal advice and let what amounts to the largest Royal sex scandal in history play out in public through the courts. Francoisapos own research began shortly after the death of Pierre-Edouard in . The soldier had never revealed the identity of Francoisapos grandfather to him, other than that he was someone famous who had not been allowed to marry your grandmother.    After a casual remark by a former girlfriend that Francois strongly resembled the Duke of Windsor, the title Edward took on his abdication, he began searching the family archives to find the missing piece in his ancestry. Francois believes the pair met at the Luna Park in Paris and continued a clandestine relationship for two years whenever Edward could escape from his wartime duties. But when Marie-Leonie fell pregnant in  Edward ended the relationship and allegedly bought her silence. This money that helped her to become one of Franceaposs leading fashion designers almost overnight - transforming her from penniless to plush.

Boohoo has been censured in a separate ruling over a socially irresponsible marketing email asking customers to send nudes. The since-banned Missguided advert - shown on ITV Hub during Love Island on June  - opened with a close-up of a womanaposs mouth as she held a strawberry between her lips.    It then showed young women in swimwear on a boat, before on-screen text stated: If you plan on wearing clothes this summer... weaposve got you covered... kind of. The ad showed young women on a beach with their legs apart in seductive poses, a woman running her hand up her inner thigh, a group of women in thong bikinis and another woman posing in a bikini with her legs astride on a motorcycle. On-screen text at the end of the ad stated “SCORE % OFF WITH CODE BABE”.    A viewer complained that the ad overly sexualised and objectied women. Missguided said the ad was aimed at those under  years of age and tried to promote a particular lestyle rather than just clothing. It said the ad was shown on video-on-demand around Love Island and was not dissimilar from the opening titles and content of the programme itself. ITV said the ad depicted similar values, swimwear and scenes as Love Island and that it was surprised to learn that a viewer of the programme had considered the content of the ad offensive.Related video: But the ASA ruled that it breached the advertising code for being overly sexualised and presenting the models as sexual objects. The ASA said: We considered that the cumulative effect of the scenes meant that overall, the products had been presented in an overly sexualised way that invited viewers to view the women as sexual objects. It added that some viewers who enjoyed watching Love Island would nevertheless be seriously offended by advertising that presented women as sexual objects. Because the ad objectied women, we concluded that it was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence.

Common disputes during year one include who is the most tired and which parent should get up in the night - but  per cent of couples will grumble about the lack of sex. Just under  per cent argue about the general lack of affection from a partner once baby is born, with  per cent of couples falling out after one pressured the other to get intimate. Division of responsibilities also set couples off bickering - with housework not being done, who should be responsible for feeding, burping and changing the baby also featuring in the list. Unfortunately, a fth of couples split up for good within the  months of having their child, after the disagreements proved too much to handle.   Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting site  ChannelMum , said: Even those couples who usually communicate brilliantly can find the first few months of having a baby tough, and arguments are a really normal part of the adjustment process.Lack of sleep during the early months, and getting used to the new-found responsibilities can pile pressure on new parents and contribute to arguments. Making time for each other can be just as important as learning how to look after the baby, as happy parents will naturally result in a happy child. The study also revealed more than six in  parents feel they werenapost prepared for the huge impact having a baby would have on their le.  Half of couples reported arguing more frequently and a third said they could sometimes go five days at a time without talking to their other half. More than a fth of parents found it dficult getting used to having less money than usual, and  per cent would bicker about one partner going out more than the other. Whether the baby is poorly or not, how much they should be eating or drinking, and whether they should be left to cry alone also lead to disagreements. Sadly, one quarter of couples found very little time for each other once the baby was born, and  per cent said when they were together, all they would do is argue.  Looking back on their first year of parenthood, four in  parents wish theyaposd done more to prepare for what was ahead. More than  per cent of parents were shocked at feeling less close to their partner once the baby was born, and  per cent wish theyaposd considered taking a course on how to aposbaby-proofapos their relationship. However,  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, did call on family and friends for additional support, and  per cent made sure they shared out the housework. Sharing night-feeds, planning ahead, making time for regular sex, having time-out with friends and regular date nights were other methods used to maintain a happy relationship.    Zo Bonser, show director at The Baby Show added: Itaposs disheartening to see so many couples break up in the first  months of parenting - one of the most exciting times in their lives. While it is a wonderful period, thereaposs no doubt about it, itaposs stressful with the change in sleep patterns, routines and responsibilities and getting used to there being a third person around that you have to care for all the time.

Jill Sharpaposs celebrations have angered her victims, who say the -year-old has shown a total lack of remorse while flaunting her freedom in Facebook posts. One snap shows Rangers fan Sharp, of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, grinning widely on a sofa with her partner Craig Hale while they are dressed in matching pyjamas. Their hands are clasped as they clutch glasses of Moët  Chandon champagne are surrounded by balloons reading Welcome home and #Done, the Daily Record reports. An undated photo posted after her early release shows her smiling in a hot tub while raising a glass of Veuve Clicquot on a previous holiday.    A friend commented: You will be back there before you know it. Sharp replied with a plane emoji, writing: You know me only too well lol... The countdown is on! Sharp was released from jail after serving just three months of her one-year term for stalking two former friends, creating fake social media profiles while tormenting them. When she was sentenced at Livingston Sherf Court in July, she wept in the dock and a judge blasted her for her disgraceful and wicked” terror campaign against Maggie Paton, , and her husband Steve. Sharp sent emails to the couple’s workplaces with  claims they were involved in criminal activity, including dealing drugs to kids.  Mr Paton, , hit out at Sharp following her release, telling the Daily Record: “There is a total lack of remorse for what she put us through. This obsession she has with champagne is sad but we won’t be intimidated by her. “It seems ridiculous that Sharp was sentenced to  months but only served three and is out before Christmas. “But the whole world now knows what she did after she admitted it in court. She is the type to just keep squirming and denying everything but even her friends and family know she is an obsessive stalker and fantasist.  “She may have got out of jail early but her reputation has been destroyed forever by what she did to us. She is a laughing stock at Ibrox and you would have to be off your head to believe she is innocent after all the details emerged in court.” After her release from jail Sharp reactivated her Facebook account and posted the snaps of her and Hale celebrating with champagne. The couple both still live with their parents. In one photo, they are seen wearing matching Rangers pyjamas. But fans have made it clear they are not welcome at old haunts such as the well-known Rangers pub the Louden Tavern.  One wrote on Twitter : “All joking aside, disgraceful those two maniacs still think it’s acceptable to post the stuff they do. “Welcome Home balloons, the lot, knowing the fact it’ll get a reaction and she will be bold enough to flaunt herself in the Louden the next home game.” In the comments under Sharpaposs Facebook photos, her friends wrote welcome back and one even joked where did u disappear to, which Sharp responded to with a laughing emoji. One friend wrote: Good to see you with the rangers top back on. Sharp replied: Thank you very much! It sure feels good lol! During Sharp’s sentencing, Sherf Douglas Kinloch said she “succeeded” in ruining the Patons’ lives, leaving them on medication and unable to work for y periods.

The -year-old woman says she is lucky to be alive after being flung through the air like a ragdoll. Jade Harrison was flung around  to  feet from the Airmaxx , hitting a teenage boy who was on the neighbouring Sizzler attraction. She wants to see the ride, which she says could have killed her, scrapped for good.Jade is still unable to smile - nine days after the accident - due to her facial injuries. She also lost a tooth and is likely to lose two more and faces weeks on liquid food, reports Hull Live .   The former waitress faces several weeks in recovery after the incident after having to undergo a two-hour operation on her broken jaw, with metal plates fitted to hold her face together. Jade - who is too upset and embarrassed to show her face in new photographs - has instructed personal injury expert Hudgell Solicitors. The law firm is now calling for a full and transparent investigation to provide Jade with answers. Re-living the ordeal, Jade said she just remembers waking up, laid on her back, with a mouth full of blood. She said: I remember the process of getting on the ride, the ride started, and as it started, the barrier clicked a bit, I said to my friend aposDid yours just click apos and he said aposyesapos, so I thought that was fine.    We must have been half way through the ride, it was bouncing a lot, spinning us around, it was OK, but then the actual carriage position of it changed, so all our weight was facing forwards onto the bar. My body was being pushed forwards and into the barrier. It started to bounce and thataposs when remember it tilting – I was worried about coming out but thataposs the last thing I remember thinking. I remember the sensation of falling out, but I donapost remember what I was thinking. There wasnapost a period where I thought the barrier was coming loose, it just happened all at once. I just remember seeing silver, asit was the floor, I would have said I fell out and dropped straight to the ground below, I didnapost know I had been flown through the air like a ragdoll until my mum told me in hospital.    Jade says she woke up, surrounded by strangers and at first she thought she was in a dream. I just remember being laid there and looking in the sky, and I could see the Star Flyer ride. People have said I looked like I was dead, with my eyes open. I thought it was a dream, I gave it a minute and then realised it wasnapost a dream and thataposs when I started to panic and people were telling me not to move. I thought Iaposd lost all of my teeth, my mouth felt like it had been scrambled. I could see my friend, I could hear people saying aposhow old is sheapos and asking him questions about me – I was trying to speak but because of what had happened, my mouth was full of blood. Jade said she does not normally go on bigger rides, but her friend had persuaded her to go on it shortly after they arrived on the evening of Monday, October .    The ride is believed to be the same one which killed an eight-year-old girl in Australia five years ago. Due to her nerves about rides, she immediately pulled down her own safety barrier. She said the attendant then came and took her £ ride fare and fastened the seatbelt. She said: “I pulled the safety bar down myself as soon as I got on as I get paranoid that rides are going to set off without my barrier being down. \u2028Jade says she is not an angry sort of person but has been left angry about what happened to her. She said: The barrier must have come free, and when that happened my le was left relying on the clasp and buckle of an old seat belt. How can that be right  Police and the Health and Safety Executive have been investigating the incident. Jade said: \u2028“I feel angry as nobody should go to a fair and be thrown from a ride. It is disgusting really and when I think about how it happened it makes me angry that the that the safety systems simply didn’t do their job. She has since been told the ride was not stopped after her fall, and instead continued until its session finished. Jade has tried not to think too much about what could have happened. She said: I feel lucky to be alive, or to have come away from this without a brain or spinal injury which would have left me paralysed for le, so I do feel lucky in a way. I’ve tried not to think too much about what could have happened to me. What I have thought about a lot is how really small children are allowed to go on these fast rides at the fair, and how dangerous they are.

First, he was rejected by his mum and then heartbreaking footage emerged of him being beaten up in his new home at Wuppertal Zoo. People were so horried by the attacks, almost , signed a petition calling for him to be ed to the UK. Several animal welfare groups said Bili had been left badly traumatised by his ordeal after being sent to the zoo in April last year. The young chimp even had his ear bitten off in the repeated attacks.  Zookeepers, who received death threats after footage of the abuse emerged, were adamant the attacks were perfectly natural. Now Bili has bounced back and made some new friends - and even bagged himself two girlfriends. Monkey curator at Wuppertal, Dr Severun Dressen, , said: We are really pleased to see how Bili is developing. He is becoming much more confident. Staff at the zoo were determined that Bili would fit into his new home and split the animals into two groups.  Dr Dressen explained: We now have two separate groups and can now focus more inidually on Biliaposs needs. \u2028The main problem was thought to be a female bonobo called Eja, , who did not like Bili.\u2028 In the bonobos world, woman are the bosses. Eja has two sons Azibo and Ayubu, eight, and they together with their motheraposs support made Biliaposs le hell from the start.\u2028 Bonobo mothers protect their sons even as adults. But because Bili was rejected by his and moved to Germany to be raised by hand, it made le very dficult for him.  Bili has now been separated from Eja, and her two sons now spend some time with the Brit chimp with no issues. And Bili has also formed a close bond with two females Mahdeblu, , and Kichele, , who are BOTH his girlfriends.\u2028 Dr Dressen said: Bili mates with both of them. Sex seems to be really important to Bili. They seem to get on well and Bili is accepted. Bili is also close to Mahdebluaposs daughter, five-year-old Akeena, and is often seen hugging her  Bili even has some male camaraderie as the troopaposs grandfather Mato, , has also accepted him and plays with him in the enclosure.  A zoo spokesman said: Bili looks much more relaxed overall. We could no longer observe any aggression against him lately.\u2028 Wuppertal Zoo director Dr Arne Lawrenz said people have a romanticised image of nature.\u2028 Dr Lawrenz added: This is why there must be zoos, where we can show what nature really looks like.\u2028 That is our mission and thataposs why we, as zoos, might be at a crossroads here. For example, in the US there is a tendency to not exhibit bonobos because they are politically incorrect in terms of their sexual behaviour and aggression.\u2028 I believe that zoos need to show people that nature is not all about peace, love and harmony, and that itaposs also about rivalry and that the animals are subject to dferent laws to humans.\u2028 Biliaposs mum, Maringa, failed to care for him when he was born in Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire, in October, .

Tragically, Mariam has been left to raise her massive family alone after her husband walked out on her almost four years ago. Now , doctors have taken action to stop Mariam having more children after it emerged her father had  children with several dferent women. Mariam has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins and incredibly manages to care for and feed them all on her own. The fertile mum was just  when she was married to her husband, who at  was  years her senior.    Just a year later she gave birth to her first set of twins. Now, she and all of her kids have no choice to live in appallingly cramped conditions in just four tiny homes made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof. Mariam, from Uganda, and her brood live surrounded by coffee fields. A doctor warned the mother that birth control, like the Pill, could cause her problems because she had unusually large oies. So after her first set of twins, the babies just kept coming.    Ugandan families are often large with women having . children on average. This is one of the highest birth rates in Africa but even by these standards, Mariamaposs family is enormous. At just , Mariam had  children and desperately begged her doctor for help to stop her having any more. But once again the medical advice was that she should keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Mariamaposs final pregnancy three years ago ended in tragedy when she gave birth to her sixth set of twins.    One of the babies died while she was in labour and then her husband, who would often leave for weeks on end, left her for good. His name is now cursed in her family. Mariam said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But it was also after this birth that the mum finally got the medical help she needed to stop her having more babies.    Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam confirmed that doctors had taken action to remove the risk of her becoming pregnant again. She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Nothing will come in the way of the dedicated mother doing all she can to provide for her children. She works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal.    Mariam brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. And she is determined her surviving children will have the very best start to le with most of her wages going on food, medical care, clothes and school fees. Hanging proudly on the wall of her tiny home are photos of her eldest children graduating from school. Despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to quit school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her.    Even Mariamaposs early years were filled with heartbreak. Her mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam. He father re-married and Mariamaposs step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food. They all died. A visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her le. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.    I was told by relatives what had happened. The scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children. Her youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent. Metal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where  of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime. Others have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.    Everyone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings. Each day, Mariam uses kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat. Although fish and meat are rare treats for the family. Mariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.

Promoters have welcomed the move as an opportunity for other producers who have access to a wider range of talent.One large firm, which spoke to the Tele on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is a very big positive#this is about partnership with promoters, and building bridges.”DF Concerts, the firm behind T In The Park and TRNSMT, is staging Bombay Bicycle Club, Bfy Clyro and the Libertines gigs at the Caird Hall before the year is out and previously expressed an interest in Slessor Gardens.The council’s approach to promoters comes after poor sales of tickets for recent shows.The latest gig at Slessor, DunDee s, failed to pull in as many punters as previous acts such as Little Mix, Olly Murs and Steps.There was criticism over scheduling of the s show as it was on the same date as a Madness gig in Montrose, which had been announced months beforehand.And Craig David’s Slessor summer show was moved to the Caird Hall, which has a quarter of the garden’s capacity.LHG claimed the move was due to “unforeseen circumstances”.Concertgoers were also angry after cut-price tickets were offered on discount website Itison just weeks after full-price briefs went on sale.Dundee City Council declined to expand on why it was now approaching other promoters, instead reissuing the same statement it provided to the Tele earlier this year.It said: “There is no long-term agreement or exclusivity agreement in place for Slessor Gardens with any promoters.“The council is continuing to carefully consider the future of the space as a venue.”Meanwhile, LHG, which previously said discussions had been “ongoing” regarding exclusivity, said it would “not be appropriate” to comment on discussions about future shows in Dundee.A spokeswoman said: “We remain committed to working with Dundee City Council and the city’s key stakeholders to realise our joint aspiration in ensuring Dundee remains a culturally vibrant and economically sustainable city.“We firmly believe a series of high quality, safe and appropriate concerts on Slessor Gardens is a key driver to help achieve this.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19531345-Scotland-v-San-Marino_33083184-760x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds super shankland hailed by fans as he scores in first scotland start","story":"Dundee United scoring sensation Lawrence Shankland has been hailed by football fans after scoring on his Scotland home debut.The Tannadice striker knocked in Scotland’s fourth goal at Hampden Park last night in a -

win over San Marino, the look of joy on Lawrence Shankland and Stuart Findlay’s faces on scoring their first goals for Scotland is very much a thing you like to see and a feeling any Scotland fan would want to experience.”And Ellen Dickson, also from Glasgow, said: “Well done Lawrence Shankland and Stuart Findlay on your Scotland goals# about time the young ones got a chance.”The Hampden triumph was set up by a first-half hat-trick from John McGinn before Shankland scored after  minutes, followed by Findlay’s first goal for his country just two minutes later.And former Dundee United player Stuart Armstrong added goal number six for Scotland with a -yard free-kick after  minutes to leave the Tartan Army singing in the rain.Shankland, , told reporters afterwards: “It’s been a great week and a great experience being in and around the squad and obviously I got a lot of game time.“Their goalie had a great save from me early on and I had a couple blocked around the six-yard box, but as a striker you miss a few.“But, thankfully, one hit the bar and luckily it dropped to me to stick it away.”Shankland made his debut as a second half substitute in Scotland’s earlier qualying group match in Russia on Thursday when the side slumped to a - defeat.Last night was his first start and goal for the international side in his home debut, roared on by family and friends.The striker, who joined United in the summer from Championship rivals Ayr United, added: “I just need to go back to my club now and keep on doing what I was doing to get me in the the squad in the first place and fingers crossed I will be in the next one.“I am delighted first of all to get my first start and managing to squeeze in a goal is great as well.“We had a pre-match meeting and the gaffer obviously named the team and I had a few hours to prepare.”Scotland vs San Marino: All the best pictures from the game\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp scotland-vs-san-marino-all-the-best-pictures-from-the-game embed # secretPNSniqlpx\" data-secret\"PNSniqlpx\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9c514cede9f2.53093169-752x564.jpg ","title":"ex michelin employees among those who are attending dundee foodbanks","story":"Former Michelin workers are among thousands across the city turning to foodbanks just to feed their families.As part of Challenge Poverty Week, the Tele visited the Dundee Foodbank in Stobswell to meet volunteers behind the scenes as well as those struggling to make ends meet who depend on the service.And one man, who declined to be named, admitted he had been forced to turn to the Trussell Trust for help after being made redundant from the tyre factory. vw, px\"  He said: “I lost my job at Michelin and I ended up desperate.“It was just awful and I can hardly describe the feeling after being in work for so many years to be let go and not find anything at my age.“I heard about the foodbank at Stobswell and walked in here and, really, it was a godsend.”The Michelin factory in Dundee is due to close in , with the loss of  jobs.

As the ball nestled in the back of the net for Scotland’s fourth in a - win over San Marino on Sunday, the -year-old was left grinning from ear to ear as he wheeled away in celebration – after first making sure he wasn’t adjudged offside.And it is hard not to share such joy with him as his rise to the top has not been straightforward.Starting out as a kid at Queen’s Park alongside Scots skipper and now-Liverpool star Andy Robertson, the pair have trodden very dferent paths to find themselves in the starting XI for the national team.While Robertson raced through the ranks at the Glasgow amateurs, Dundee United and Hull before becoming a Champions League winner and one of the top left-backs in the world at Liverpool, Shankland almost dropped out of full-time football completely.A move to Aberdeen didn’t quite work out for “Shanks”, despite decent loan spells at Dunfermline and St Mirren.Considering going part-time or giving up the game altogether, he was handed a leline by Ayr United manager Ian McCall. The rest, as they say, is history.With a qualying double-header next month against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, Shankland now looks very likely to be involved, fitness permitting.Certainly,he keeps banging in the goals at his current rate for United, he will be hard to resist, not just for Steve Clarke but other potential suitors, too."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.6120992-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.6120992-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.6120992-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.6120992-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"scotlands biggest gin festival heading to dundee next month","story":"Dundee drinkers have the chance for a bumper gin and tonic day at this year’s Gin Fest.The popular event is spread over two sessions on Saturday November  and organiser Carrie Shannon expects more than  people to swarm to the Bonar Hall.It is billed as Scotland’s biggest gin festival and this year it’ll feature nine new gins plus a prosecco bar.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Newlands hit back just before the break.Star were up against it for large spells of the second half but the back three of Andy Weir, Ricky Reid and Ben Forbes defended well with Ally Lewis doing well in goals.The visitors took the lead again with  minutes remaining when Angus Lewis fired home a goal of the season contender from  yards.The Lochgilphead side were perhaps a bit naïve as they chased the killer third goal, instead of playing for time in the corners.They were punished with the last attack of the  minutes when Newlands scored from a corner which took a wicked bounce on the way through making he score -.An uneventful  minutes of extra time took place, with both goalkeepers untroubled, before the match went to penalty kicks and it was the home side who prevailed -. Star goalscorers were Ben Forbes, Coll McCallum and Andy Weir.Red Star have a free weekend tomorrow because of the holiday weekend and will start their league campaign the following week, hoping to have the majority of their first team players back fit."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe weather was kind to the youthful climate change protesters and they certainly made their presence felt in Lochgilphead and Tarbert.The fundamental mindsets of people across the globe has to change fastwe are going to make any impression on what seems to be a climate change juggernaut.Do we need that plastic packaging on our fruit and vegetables  Is there an alternative to taking a flight to our destination  Could we buy local rather than importing produce It all starts with inidual responsibility.

As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the project unexpectedly developed: finding myself writing additional poems about aspects of the city which Allan then went out to photograph.\"The journey towards finding a visual and poetic narrative

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

Would they be that stupid  I fear they would. It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

The AEG estimates that earnings of pound, are required to get on the housing ladder.A study carried out by the group warns that the lack of housing for workers will have serious impacts on the islandrsquos population as time goes on, with  jobs being lost due to lack of affordable accommodation each year with a pound.m loss to the local economy.After  years,things remain as they are, the employment impacts are expected to have risen to  jobs lost and a pound.m shortfall per annum.Ms Borthwick added: ldquoThere are job vacancies right across the island we canrsquot fill because therersquos nowhere for them to stay.

Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable.

We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, on Andrew Marr on Sunday, invoked EFTA as a short-term post-Brexit solution. I expect that will just be the start."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-im-not-complaining-not-nicolas-best-mate","story":"Joanna Cherry QC revealed she had only ever had one sit-down talk with the current First Minister despite being being an MP since .The Scottish Tories said it showed \"sour\" relations at the top of the party.Ms Cherry also said she had only received a single text of congratulations from Ms Sturgeon over her recent legal wins on Brexit and the unlawful prorogation of Westminster.ldquoIrsquom not complaining that Irsquom not Nicolarsquos best mate, she told Holyrood magazine, addingthe First Minister had a country to run.:Historic court defeat for Boris JohnsonHowever the Edinburgh South West MP said she was a good friend of Alex Salmond, calling him ldquothe greatest leader the partyrsquos ever had.Referring to former First Ministerrsquos impending criminal trial, she said she was worried about the ldquopolitical fall-out for the party.She said: ldquoAlex is my friend, and I was brought up to stand by my friends.

Itrsquos ridiculous.ldquoIrsquom at Westminster, the leader of the SNP must be at Holyrood, because they must be capable of being First Minister, and I have never said I want to be party leader others have said it and frankly, I wish they wouldnrsquot, because it just causes me grief I could do without.However, she did not deny that she would want the position.She said: ldquoSome people think Irsquove got a big ego, because I donrsquot say, lsquoOh no, it couldnrsquot possibly be little old mersquo.ldquoThat is what women are expected to do, butI was a man of my age, with my professional background, people would take it for granted that I might want a leadership role, and I certainly wouldnrsquot have to apologise for it.ldquoSo, what Irsquom saying is, I wouldnrsquot rule myself out for the future, but there is no leadership vacancy right now and Irsquom not putting myself forward as a potential leader of the SNP at the moment.ldquoThose who are doing so are mentioning my name without my involvement or my permission.Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoItrsquos clear relations at the top of the SNP are turning sour.ldquoPerhaps itrsquos no wonder Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want to give the time of day to an MP whorsquos so blatantly pitching for her job."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-broadcaster-kirsty-young-appointed-royal-foundation","story":"Young is joining Professor Stefan Allesch-Taylor, Steven Cooper and Karen Blackett as a trustee of Harry and Meghans charitable body.The presenter, who stepped down permanently as host of BBC Radio s Desert Island Discs in the summer, is also President of Unicef.: SNP raffle car at conference despite declaring climate emergencyIt is understood that Young is a trusted friend of Harry and Meghans and was the first person the couple asked to join Sussex Royal earlier this year, although schedules meant the official paperwork has only now been completed.It comes as the couple paid tribute to seriously ill youngsters and their families at the annual WellChild Awards today.WellChild was one of the four charities chosen by the Sussexes to benefit from donations made by the public following the birth of their son, Archie, in May.Meghan told Milly Sutherland, , and her mother Angela, , from Liverpool, that Archie had been to playgroup for the first time.She said: \"I just took Archie for his first [playgroup] class.

What is needed is a whole new concept of managing recycling in the new economy.Two things that hinder recycling is firstly, the technology to do it efficiently, in a circular way where recyclable materials re-enter the manufacturing cycle as raw ingredients and, secondly, the absence of a  where information is recorded accurately.The labelling on clothes provides little or no information and because the raw materials and then the finished garments will often pass through multiple parties, there are inevitably blind spots in the end-to-end chain from production to sale.Reliable and easily accessible information is paramount to accurate sorting of collected goods for recycling, enabling the re-use of raw resources and thus generating equilibrium.Studies showwe could double the number of times a garment could be worn, then emissions would be % lower.Synthetic ldquoplastic fibres like polyester, nylon and acrylic currently make up about two-thirds of the global fibre market and are technically recyclable, in as much as plastic polymers can be recycled.Being able to identy each of these treads in a garment ndash whether they are cotton, linen, polyester or blends ndash enables them to be sorted into well-defined material streams so they can re-enter the economy rather than ending up as waste once they are no longer wanted.As the founder of a tech company, I am fascinated by how new technology can bring about real change in the fashion industry.The tech wersquore using invisibly marks raw materials at a molecular level from the original source across three le cycles: raw material to production, production to commercial, and commercial to recycling.The numerous, multi-layered data is then securely stored on blockchain.Currently, wersquore trialling the use of these ecological ldquomarkers into seeds to provide additional protection for the agriculture industry.Since it marks the molecular matter of raw materials, the same technology can be used in the fashion industry.Pure materials can be recaptured, allowing brand owners to recycle them ndash thus converting a linear economy to a circular one.There is also an added benefit in that this kind of tech will allow fashion brands to combat the . trillion that global businesses lose to counterfeit goods and, with the markers on raw materials, textiles and finished garments stored on blockchain, the company is able to lodge a credible carbon credit claim.The fashion industryrsquos commercial ecosystem is locked in a battle that consists of many fronts.Just as we cannot live without plastics, we cannot live without fashion.The Scottish textiles industry alone is worth pound million to the Scottish economy and has an ambition to grow by % by .As Japanrsquos Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pointed out, we canrsquot treat plastic as an enemy whatrsquos needed is appropriate management of our waste and search for solutions through innovation.This is the time where we need to develop new and better ways of recycling.

The party was also happy with Mr Johnsonrsquos plan for a UK exit from the customs union, as the backstop would have seen the UK remain in a customs union until alternative arrangements to ensure a free-flowing Irish border had been agreed.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media yENNqJQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests yENNqJQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": ndash Current negotiations:Mr Johnsonrsquos plans did not lead to a breakthrough, with the EU ndash and Ireland in particular ndash opposed to his proposals around consent and customs.

As UK and EU negotiators engage in last-ditch talks to overcome the sticking points, the DUP remains a central player. Mrs Foster has been a regular visitor to Downing Street in recent days, making clear her party will not accept a deal that creates a customs border in the Irish Sea.Other views in Northern IrelandMany in Northern Ireland are frustrated at the influential role the Brexit-backing DUP has exerted, given the region voted to remain by % to %. A majority of the members elected to the currently defunct Assembly in  are from pro-Remain parties and in Mayrsquos European election, two of Northern Irelandrsquos three seats were filled by pro-Remain pro-backstop candidates. The main business and agriculture groups in Northern Ireland supported Mrs Mayrsquos deal ndash a stance that brought some of them into open conflict with the DUP. However, the regionrsquos complex political history means the majority viewpoint on Brexit has not been articulated as loudly as it might otherwise have been in the Commons.

Critically, the region is free from grey squirrels.The first animals were released this week, with the others to follow later this month and in November.Becky Priestley, Trees for Lersquos Red Squirrel Project Manager, said: ldquoWe are reintroducing red squirrels to carefully chosen native woodlands where these iconic wild animals belong, but from which they have been lost. They will then be able to spread, safe from threats from grey squirrels.ldquoThe Woodland Trustrsquos Ledmore and Migdale Woods are a perfect habitat for red squirrels. Itrsquos fantastic to be helping the speciesto this beautul part of the Highlands, and to be kick-starting their reintroduction to northeast Scotland.The charity says ldquourgent action is needed to secure the long-term future of the increasingly rare red squirrel in the UK. It estimates there may be as few as , left, including some , in Scotland.Their numbers have fallen largely due to reduction of their forest homes to isolated fragments and the spread of the non-native grey squirrel.Greys, which were first introduced to Britain from North America in the th century, out-compete red squirrels for resources, and can also carry squirrelpox, a virus that doesnrsquot harm them but is deadly to reds.Recent research suggests the decline of the iconic native species can be halted, however, with the animals holding on in many parts of Scotland and increasing their range in some areas, including the North East, around Aberdeen, where they have ed for the first time in decades.Because reds naturally avoid crossing large open spaces, they have struggled toto now-fragmented woodlands and so remain missing from many suitable Highland woods.New red squirrel populations already established by Trees for Le, following the charityrsquos reintroduction of  animals across several Highland locations between  and , have been successfully breeding and spreading into wider areas.Spinningdale is Trees for Lersquos northernmost release site so far. Previous relocations of squirrels from their strongholds in Inverness-shire and Moray were to forest fragments at Shieldaig, the Coulin Estate near Kinlochewe, Plockton, Inverewe, the Reraig peninsular, Attadale and Letterewe.Ross Watson, Woodland Trust Scotlandrsquos North Scotland Site Manager, said: ldquoWersquore delighted to be involved in Trees for Lersquos inspiring and much-needed red squirrel reintroduction project. The ancient woods at Ledmore and Migdale include a stunning pinewood and one of the most northerly oakwoods in Britain. It is perfect for red squirrels.ldquoVolunteers from the local community have come forward to help us ease the reds into their new home. They will be feeding and monitoring how the squirrels are getting on. It is great that the local community is going to be a part of this exciting project, and with  volunteers the squirrels will almost have one each.Sutherland is home to an expanding population of red squirrels, following a relocation of  animals to the Alladale, Amat and Croick estates by the Highland Foundation for Wildle and others in , but the species currently remains missing from much of the northern Highlands.Trees for Le plans to extend the redsrsquo range further west next spring by releasing another  animals in the Morvern peninsular. The charity then aims to reintroduce reds to another two woodlands in the northwest Highlands by spring , with at least one of these sites -- which have yet to be confirmed -- being further north in Sutherland or Caithness.Animal welfare is paramount during the reintroductions. The squirrels are transported in hay-lined nest boxes that are fixed to trees at the release sites, with grass-filled exit holes allowing the squirrels to leave when ready.Food is provided for several months as the squirrels get used to their new habitat. Annual monitoring involves observations of feeding signs, drey surveys and sightings records.Only a small numbers of red squirrels are removed from any site during the relocations, leaving donor populations unaffected. Health checks ensure that only healthy animals are introduced to new populations.Trees for Le is dedicated to rewilding the Scottish Highlands. So far its volunteers have established nearly two million native trees at  sites across the Highlands, encouraging wildle to flourish and helping communities to thrive.Increasing red squirrel numbers also benefits the expansion of native forests, because the squirrels collect and bury thousands of tree seeds each autumn, which often lie forgotten and take root."},{"url":null,"title":"kemnay post office set to reopen in 2019","story":"The Kemnay Post Office is set to reopen next month in a new location.The Post Office has announced that the new community branch will be located at the McColl’s shop on Aquithie Road.The new location is just a short walk from the previous Post Office on High Street, which has been temporarily closed since October due to the resignation of the previous Postmaster and the withdrawal of the premises for Post Office use.When the move goes ahead, the branch will open, from am–pm Monday to Saturday and am–pm on Sunday.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThousands of people across Scotland, including folk in Orkney, will get the chance to listen to birdsong in some rather unusual locations tomorrow, October , as part of a RSPB Scotland#s initiative to highlight declines in wildle.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Six years on from a deeply isive debate, here we go again... maybe.But for as long as Scotland keeps electing Scottish National Party governments, this is a question that will not go away – the clue is in the party’s title. Independence is the SNP’s raison d’etre, so it would be rather odd, to put it mildly,they decided to drop the whole idea.However the First Minister’s speech to her party conference offered hope for those fearing a descent into what she called “crude populism” of Donald Trump and co.“That is not for us. That is not who we are,” Sturgeon said.The SNP would win independence not by “demonising those who disagree, and plastering lies on the side of a bus. We will win by inspiring and persuading”.: Nicola Sturgeon says independence referendum ‘must happen’ in : Scottish Independence: One fth of Scots ‘undecided or open minded’ about leaving the UKThe Union and independence arouse strong passions in many of us, but it is important to remember that we all live together in this small country and each of us has a democratic right to our own opinion.We should all try to disagree agreeably.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc scotland presenter judith ralston swears after fluffing weather report","story":"Scottish weather presenter Judith Ralston swore on last nights Seven Days review programme after forgetting part of her report. window.twttr The BBC Scotland presenter was quick to apologise for saying the F-word before her sound was cut.

By the new year, we will have completed our legislative preparations.“We are already working to update the independence prospectus.“And I can confirm today that before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt.“And when I do, the question should not be to the SNP – what will we doWestminster refuses “The question should be demanded of the Westminster parties – what gives you any right to deny people in Scotland our ability to choose our own future ”The Edinburgh agreementWestminster has control over the constitution and agreement must struck to transfer power to Holyrood to stage such a vote, similar to the Edinburgh Agreement reached between Alex Salmond and David Cameronin  But this has been refused by Boris Johnson with the Queen’s Speech at Westminster this week effectively rejecting another referendum.It prompted one leading Scottish Government minister, constitution secretary Mike Russell, to warn this week that a court challenge to secure Scotland’s right to stage a second referendum “cannot be ruled out.”But the First Minister insisted yesterday that the problem is the current constitutional set-up.She said: “That problem is the Westminster political union.

In the circumstances now Scotland faces, we have a duty to do so.“And it is what we intend to do.”BrexitThe fallout of the  Brexit referendum, which saw Scots vote to remain in the UK, was branded a “disaster” by Ms Sturgeon.She added: “Whatever happens over the next few weeks it will continue to dominate Westminster for years to come. There is no sense in which it will be ‘done’.“We don’t yet know whether the UK will leave with a deal or without. But we do know that neither of these outcomes is in Scotland’s interests.”While she said a no-deal Brexit would be “unthinkable” she added that “a deal of the type Boris Johnson is proposing would not be much better”.The First Minister said: “His plans would take Scotland out of the EU, out of the single market and out of the customs union.” “Let me make this absolutely clear today, SNP MPs will not vote for that - not now, not ever.”With a general election widely expected in the coming months Ms Sturgeon said it “can’t some soon enough.”She added: “When it does our message will be clear, simple and unambiguous - vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotland’s right to choose.Ms Sturgeon said: “Some polls suggest that an election might result in a hung parliament.“The SNP will never put the Tories into power.“But I have a message for any Westminster party that wants SNP support.“If you don’t respect Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone.”Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the speech showed that Ms Sturgeon’s priorities were not domestic issues her Government has responsibility for.“Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on health and education, yet she couldn’t spare a single sentence for either during this y and isive speech,” he said.“Instead, she simply wanted to get through what was a potentially hostile conference with a series of vacuous promises which will never be kept, and throw some red meat to the hardliners.He added: “When she does demand the powers to hold a second unwanted and isive referendum, the answer should be an unequivocal no.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie warned independence would mean “cuts and tax rises.”He added: “Independence will be bad for Scotland just like Brexit because breaking up long term economic partnerships is very hard to do.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, added: “This was a speech full of nationalist rhetoric with no answers about the catastrophic impact of breaking up the UK.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"dup defends its position as rivals claim its been suckered in brexit talks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What will actually be behind that sort of transaction  If it is as seamless as that, then it is something people will deal with and take in their stride.\"Meanwhile, Ivor Ferguson, president of the Ulster Farmers Union, told the committee that livelihoods would be ruinedthere was not an \"orderly and managed\" EU exit.Mr Ferguson painted a bleak picture when asked what the consequences of a no-deal would be for his industry.\"Right from the word go, we realised that a no-deal would be catastrophic for our farming members,\" he told MPs.\"It would be catastrophic across all sectors of farming and, indeed, for the agri-food business in general. Of course, the agri-food business and farming is the biggest sector in Northern Ireland, so it would have a detrimental effect even on the Northern Ireland economy.\"He said the potential for signicant tarfs on goods moving into the Republic of Ireland was the most concerning threat, highlighting that % of milk and % of lambs produced in Northern Ireland go south.\"What would it mean for us  It would mean market failure and it would mean bankruptcy for a fair percentage of farmers,\" Mr Ferguson said of a no-deal.\"Obviously, you can understand it is a place that we just dont want to go.\"PSNI Assistant Chief Constable George Clarke warned that while the dissident threat had been severe for a decade, there could be a potential further upsurge after Brexit.He said the UKs exit from the EU could serve as a \"clarion call\" for the violent extremists. \"They have a potential to rally,\" he said. \"There is a potential for opportunities to exist for them to carry out their terrorist crimes and activities depending on whatinfrastructure, for example, would look like.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit foster dismisses as nonsense claims dup accepts proposal on stormont consent","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The campaign did not ide neatly along traditional orange green lines in Northern Ireland, with the Ulster Unionist Party, for instance, backing Remain. While the DUP undoubtedly counted committed Brexiteers within its ranks, there were other senior members who had a more pro-European outlook. With the party styling itself as pro-business and having a strong farming support base, it would not have been a major surprisethe DUP had chosen to sit on the fence, allowing its representatives to take their own position on the isive issue.When the party did declare for Brexit, it campaigned for it enthusiastically. At one point, it shelled out hundreds of thousands of pounds for a full wraparound advert in thenewspaper. That incident sparked controversy in Northern Ireland when it emerged the party paid for the ad – in a paper not printed in Northern Ireland – with part of a £,-plus donation from a little known Brexit-backing group called the Constitutional Research Council.–  election:\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May with the DUP’s Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in  amid talks over a deal to prop up the minority Conservative Government Theresa May’s ill-fated decision to call a snap general election catapulted the DUP into the unexpected role of parliamentary kingmakers. The prime minister lost her majority and was only able to form a workable government through a confidence and supply arrangement with the unionist party’s  MPs. In , the DUP secured a £ billion-plus investment package for Northern Ireland. From that moment on, the party led by Arlene Foster assumed a role of influence in the Brexit process that appeared to outweigh its numbers on the Westminster benches.– Theresa May’s deal:DUP opposition to the agreement Mrs May struck with the EU in November  was crucial. Many other MPs voted against the prime minister on the three occasions she tried and failed to secure parliamentary approval but the outcome could well have been dferentthe DUP had backed it. If the party had dropped its opposition to the Irish border backstop, there is an argument that several Tory Brexiteers would have followed suit, potentially giving Mrs May the numbers to edge a Commons vote.But for the DUP, Mrs May’s controversial backstop was something it just could not stomach. For the unionists, an arrangement which would have seen Northern Ireland erge from the rest of the UK on regulatory rules – without an obvious exit mechanism – undermined the constitutional integrity of the UK and created an economic border in the Irish Sea.For the DUP, the Union comes above everything. Brexit has never been its raison d’etre the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is.– Boris Johnson’s proposals:\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson with Arlene Foster The DUP was accused of performing a sharp U-turn when it backed Mr Johnson’s Brexit plan – proposals that also envisaged Northern Ireland in a dferent regulatory framework from Britain. The party rejected the claim, insisting the dference with the new blueprint was a consent provision that would have handed the Stormont Assembly, and potentially the DUP itself, a veto on both the adoption of the system and its continuation. The DUP welcomed the Prime Minister’s pledge, outlined in his letter to the EU, of another investment package for Northern Ireland. The party was also happy with Mr Johnson’s plan for a UK exit from the customs union, as the backstop would have seen the UK remain in a customs union until alternative arrangements to ensure a free-flowing Irish border had been agreed.– Current negotiations:Mr Johnson’s plans did not lead to a breakthrough, with the EU – and Ireland in particular – opposed to his proposals around consent and customs. The bloc was not prepared to hand a single party in a regional assembly a veto on the operation of an international treaty, while EU leaders also expressed scepticism on how an open border could be maintainedNorthern Ireland and the Irish Republic were in dferent customs zones. As UK and EU negotiators engage in last-ditch talks to overcome the sticking points, the DUP remains a central player. Mrs Foster has been a regular visitor to Downing Street in recent days, making clear her party will not accept a deal that creates a customs border in the Irish Sea.– Other views in Northern Ireland:Many in Northern Ireland are frustrated at the influential role the Brexit-backing DUP has exerted, given the region voted to remain by % to %. A majority of the members elected to the currently defunct Assembly in  are from pro-Remain parties and in May’s European election, two of Northern Ireland’s three seats were filled by pro-Remain pro-backstop candidates. The main business and agriculture groups in Northern Ireland supported Mrs May’s deal – a stance that brought some of them into open conflict with the DUP. However, the region’s complex political history means the majority viewpoint on Brexit has not been articulated as loudly as it might otherwise have been in the Commons. Sinn Fein’s long-standing abstentionist policy means its seven MPs do not take their seats, leaving independent North Down MP Lady Sylvia Hermon as the sole local voice challenging the DUP’s  MPs."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support.”EU sources are talking nonsense. Discussions continue. Needs to be a sensible deal which unionists and nationalists can support. https:t.co CpugVBfyBZ— Arlene FosterOctober , Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was “confident” a deal can be struck by the current deadline and raised the prospect of another EU summit being held in the coming weeks.But he warned there are still numerous hurdles in the way, after speaking with Mr Johnson and the European Commission on Wednesday morning.“There is a pathway to a possible deal but there are many issues that still need to be resolved, particularly around the consent mechanism and issues around customs and VAT,” he said.“Although time is running short I am confident these objectives can be achieved.”Saturday is a key date for the PM, however, with the Benn Act passed by MPs trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit stating he must write to Brussels asking for a delayParliament does not agree to a deal by then.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay gives evidence to the Exiting the European Union Committee Mr Barclay was questioned by the legislation’s namesake, Labour’s Hilary Benn, when appearing at the Exiting the European Union Committee of MPs.The Brexit Secretary reiterated that the PM would write to Brussels asking for an Article  extension, as previously revealed in documents submitted during a Scottish court challenge.“I can confirm, as the Prime Minister has repeatedly set out, that firstly the Government will comply with the law, and secondly it will comply with undertakings given to the court in respect of the law,” he said.Mr Barclay confirmed that the Government “will abide by” what is set out in that letter, following fears the PM could try to scupper an extension with a second contradictory letter or request to a member state to block an extension.The Cabinet minister reiterated the Government’s commitment to leave the EU on the current October  deadline, despite the act demanding a delay to the end of JanuaryMPs to do not approve a deal by Saturday.The PM is expected to update his Cabinet on progress in the negotiations at the rescheduled time of .pm on Wednesday, while Mr Barnier will update the EU at pm UK time. If Mr Johnson succeeded in bringing a deal home to the UK, he would then face a battle to do what Theresa May failed to do three times and get it approved by Parliament.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he is “deeply concerned” about the negotiations and ruled out his party backing a deal under Mr Johnson’s reported terms.The DUP’s MPs and their influence over the Tories are key in swinging any vote Mr Johnson’s way, and he was to meet them for the third time in as many days on Wednesday afternoon.Talks between the PM’s team and hardline Brexiteers from the European Research Groupwere also expected to continue.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  ERG chairman and self-styled “Brexit hardman” Steve Baker earlier said he was “optimistic” that Mr Johnson’s team would finalise a “tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for”.But a split among the hardliners became visible over reports that Mr Johnson may agree to a customs border down the Irish Sea, a move former environment secretary Owen Paterson said would be “unacceptable”.However, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader and a former ERG chair, believes an agreement could be accepted by MPs, telling LBC: “I think the votes are there now for a deal.”The DUP has helped prop up the Tory administration following increased funding from Mr Johnson’s predecessor in Number  as part of a confidence and supply deal, in a £ billion package branded as a “bribe”.There is speculation more money could be headed in the direction of Ms Foster’s party as the PM tries to get them on board with any concessions.The DUP were decidedly lukewarm on the mooted proposals in a statement after their second audience with the PM in as many days, with a spokesman saying “gaps remain and further work is required”.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said DUP backing would be influential for his colleagues.“There will be quite a lot of Tory MPs who will take their line from what the DUP do,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.Pressure to sign off on a draft agreement is peaking. A legal text needs to be published ahead of the summitthe EU are to consider ratying the Withdrawal Agreement at the two-day summit.Their approval would allow Mr Johnson to put the deal to MPs in a proposed extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday.If that showdown is to take place the Government must put a motion before the Commons on Wednesday, to be voted upon on Thursday.During the weekend session, MPs would be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or discuss what to do next in the Brexit saga."},{"url":null,"title":"student from northern ireland caught up in terrifying french yellow vest rally","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots.

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

This is a charity venture. Itrsquos about providing a wonderful educationfor children who may have been struggling in mainstream and providing an alternative that doesnrsquot cost anything. Wersquore trying to do something which is beneficial to the community.Dinas Powys Community Council and councillor Andrew Robertson have objected to the plans, raising fears over traffic and noise.Ms Church has said justone vehicle will be needed to take children to and from the school.She said: ldquoWe have sent out a letter to our neighbours in the hope they can come to usthey have any problems.ldquoWe had a really positive meeting. We talked about a lot of the issues regarding who has complained and itrsquos a very small group of people.ldquoAs compared to the picture painted for them by neighbours, [the council] were surprised at what we were doing and how compliant wersquore already being.ldquoWersquore hopeful of a positive outcome but we donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen.ldquoWe have had thousands of messages of support from emails and twitter messages. Mostly itrsquos people seeing itrsquos such a positive thing wersquore doing.Marcus Goldsworthy, head of planning and regeneration at Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoA planning application has been submitted for the temporary use of a former residential annex as a school.ldquoThe application remains under consideration and planning officers have met with the applicant and her agents to discuss the further information that is required to support the application, and allow it to be fully considered. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.One of the litter of rescue puppies hoping they wont be left in the lurchThe puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer. We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home. It is important for owners to continue the training at home on a regular basis to practice what their pet has learned in class.If you believe a dog is for le and would like to find out more about the adorable Lurcher puppies, get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymena.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says.

PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis.

One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar.
