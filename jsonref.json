Sadly, it wasn’t to be.‘For me, the only choice after losing him was to keep our home, horses and everything just as it was. My aim was to fulfil the dream we had begun together and live as I had always lived — one day at a time and in the moment.‘I didn’t give a thought to the fact that eventually it might become too much for me.’Susan would tell friends it was her horses that saw her through the darkest times.‘Whenever I felt down, I would wrap my arms around one of their strong necks and feel their power, sensitivity and strength.’She refers to the horses as her ‘children’ and is fastidious about who they are sold on to.         During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside‘I need to know they are going to be loved and cared for in the way I love and care for them,’ she says. ‘That’s all that matters. Sometimes it’s heartbreaking parting with them, especially my favourites. But I want what’s best for them.’Even while she was making films in Hollywood, she always dreamt of one day working with horses.During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside with pigs, sheep and rare breeds.‘After we married in Fiji, we made the decision to leave California. We bought a beautiful 17th-century farmhouse in Northampton.’It was here that they started breeding Arabians.‘I loved my first mare to pieces and although she was primarily my riding horse, she was mother of my first foal. And there it began.’Almost before they knew it, they had ten horses to manage but not enough land.It was while visiting friends in a remote part of Devon that they came across what they considered ‘the most beautiful spot on Earth’ — Exmoor National Park. There, they were able to buy a sheep and cattle farm of 50 acres, which would allow them to expand their Arabian stud business.‘It’s not for nothing that Lorna Doone was written here,’ Susan says. ‘The wilds of Exmoor are rough and rugged — it’s special. This house had been dearly loved by a farmer and his wife and there was a good feeling about it from the moment we stepped inside.‘I love this house so much. It’s my beautiful home. But beautiful as it is, it’s deep in the heart of the countryside, which makes it difficult for me to do anything spontaneously.‘I used to think of my farm as my sanctuary, as “the place where Simon is”. Well, that’s nonsense because he will be with me wherever I go.         Susan is in the throes of completing her autobiography (pictured: Dustin Hoffman, Susan George Straw Dogs, 1971)‘I feel that eventually I’ll move away from Somerset, but when and where to I have no idea. It will be with several of my horses, though, and I’ll continue to breed them, just in a much smaller way.‘Simon would have wanted me to move sooner, I’m certain of that. But he would also know I would do it in my own time.’Apart from returning to the world of acting, Susan is in the throes of completing her autobiography. She promised Simon she would complete her memoirs.He always encouraged her to write, saying that her stories were far too good not to be shared with other people.During her career she has mixed with royalty — she is a friend of Prince Charles and attended his marriage to Princess Diana — and Hollywood stars.‘I’m so fortunate to have been part of that era when you would go to a party and think nothing of being in the company of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,’ she says.Her friends at the time included Frank Sinatra, Lord Olivier, Liza Minnelli, Michael Caine and Olivia Newton-John.In 2016, in memory of Simon, she launched Lasting Life, the Simon MacCorkindale Legacy, a charity that aims to provide financial support for cancer sufferers.‘His wish would have been to help others in his name,’ she says.Some years ago, Susan brought Simon’s 93-year-old mother Gill to live with her at the farm, and says she would never contemplate her mother-in-law going into a nursing home.‘I treasure her,’ she says. ‘I’m so happy to have her in my life.’As she prepares herself for the next chapter, I wonder whether she feels ready for romance again.She tosses back her blonde hair. ‘There will only ever be one love of my life and that was Simon,’ she says.‘I’m never lonely, life is incredibly busy and I’m happy in my own company. Do I think Simon would want that for me? The answer probably is yes, and mine would be, you can never say never!‘None of us knows what’s around the corner. I am mindful that everything we have in life is on loan to us and I appreciate it all. I was so lucky to have 30 years of unconditional love shared with Simon and for that I will always be grateful.’Susan’s focus at the moment is on discussions for a documentary about her life with horses and the charity.The farm is buzzing with excitement in preparation for their next big fundraiser, the Georgian Arabians showcase, and friends from the entertainment world will be joining her to celebrate.‘To be surrounded by special friends and horses,’ she says. ‘What more could I ask for?’"},{"url":null,"title":"Grandmother 81 tells bravely fought cash point mugger","story":"Share this article She said: \u0027I thought, No, you\u0027re not having my money, I\u0027ve worked hard for that.\u0027 The pensioner quickly grabbed her card and was able to overpower the much younger woman. \u0027I got her hair as well as her collar and she started screaming,\u0027 Doreen said. \u0027I don\u0027t know why she was screaming.

This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Since Patrick Kavanagh published The Great Hunger in 1942, any book about the poetry of rural life and youth’s endless summer must of necessity be acknowledged as sentimental. The best rural writers demolished these cliches long ago, and built in their place a literature that chronicled with unflinching, sorrowful honesty the world we all came from before we moved into the cities.One thinks of John McGahern, or RS Thomas’s dismissal of those who idealised Wales: “Too far for you to see  The fluke and the foot-rot and the fat maggot”. Without great skill, the country chronicler’s work will fall into the category of tourist fodder – Scottish shortbread, English ale, Welsh rarebit and tales of green Ireland. Such books only kill the places they claim to love.It takes time for Niall Williams to convince you that tourist fodder isn’t what he’s producing in This Is Happiness, the successor to his Booker-longlisted 2014 novel History of the Rain. The question Williams’s narrator, Noe (short for Noel), asks himself, “What does it matter what one old man was hoping one time?”, lingers with you as you read. Noe goes to stay with his grandparents in the village of Faha in Kerry at the same time as it is being connected up to the national grid, some time in the early 1970s. Throughout the spring that passes into summer in the course of his story, it also stops raining in this normally sodden parish. In the wake of personal grief, Noe has experienced a crisis of faith, and is taking time away from the seminary where he is studying for the priesthood. He ends up sharing a room with a man named Christy, who is laying cables into the village Noe’s grandparents had agreed to take him in as a lodger before they knew Noe was coming to stay.Bringing electricity turns out only to be Christy’s means of coming to Faha, though his real reason for doing so is a woman named Annie Mooney, whom the locals know as Mrs Gaffney the chemist’s widow. Half a century after he last saw her, Christy woke up one day in a boarding house in Boston and decided that he needed to see her again. All a little baroque, but Noe acknowledges that people in Faha prefer complexity over plain speaking, which has been corrupted by the politicians. So let’s forgive him that.But the plot is really a vehicle for Noe, half a century after the events he recalls, to write down his memories of Faha. The real heart of the book is a man remembering a summer when grief gave way to romantic love: the beginning of his adult life. This is how the novel finally earns its setting and sentimentality – it is among these familiar tropes of Irish writing that Noe’s youth happened, so it is here he must inevitably return in old age, “because, at the end, we all go back to the beginning”.As his story develops into one of boyish, sexless infatuation, what becomes clear is that the book is sentimental because the love it recalls – the romantic, abstracted love of a young man – is deeply sentimental, and Williams is being faithful to his subject. The first time Noe is struck by the thunderbolt, what he records is that “she is gentle, all simplicity and kindness … she is small and light and all business … her eyebrows … have an attraction which can’t be measured”, which is the most chaste rendering of love at first sight I think I’ve ever read, but by no means an unfamiliar kind of bloodless, youthful longing.The pleasure of this novel lies in its eye for detail. The plot, having been established, then takes a long time to do not very much more. What happens instead is a kind of tectonic movement from spring into summer, marked by the rhythms of village life. Williams is excellent on churchgoing, amateur dramatics, parking, the cinema. He lavishes close attention on his parishioners, and finds rich material there. He has a humorist’s eye, and his own fond amusement at the people he writes about shines out through the writing.The fields of Ireland are very crowded, but by the conclusion of This Is Happiness, you feel Williams has justified adding another book to the herd.• Barney Norris’s latest novel is The Vanishing Hours (Doubleday).

Both sides then announced fresh tariffs, but have recently delayed or watered them down, ahead of fresh talks in October.Newsflash: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned that global growth has slowed to its weakest since the financial crisis.That would be the weakest annual performance since the great recession a decade ago.The Paris-based organisation warns that the costs of the US-China trade war are mounting, and the world risks falling into a prolonged period of weak growth unless governments act.More to follow....Tom Leman, head of retail \u0026amp consumer at Pinsent Masons, argues that too many retailers are still playing ‘catch-up’ - - and Brexit worries aren’t helping.Here’s his take on August’s retail sales figures.“Whilst monthly stats are a useful indicator of the market they do not tell the full story. The challenging global political environment makes it difficult to make too many assumptions, from these figures, about the health of the retail sector. The threat of a no-deal Brexit makes it almost impossible to predict retail sales and consumer spending in September and October.Traditional retailers who have evolved their business to reap the rewards of changing consumer behaviours are ahead of the game. These retailers articulate clearly what they stand for and deliver the right products in the right way to customers. But, there are many, generally stuck in the middle, still playing catch-up who need to focus on business evolution to remain competitive.”Economist Rupert Seggins has crunched today’s retail sales figures...and also pointed out that the monthly data should be treated cautiously.Just in: UK retail sales fell in August, suggesting that consumers are becoming more cautious.The ONS blames “non-store retailing” for this fall -- suggesting that people spent less money online last month. It says:July’s figures have been revised higher, though, so it’s not all bad.High street retailer Next has been burned by the unusually hot autumn weather.CEO Simon Wolfson argues that the weather, rather than Brexit, is the problem:It is very hard to determine whether the uncertainty over Brexit is having any effect on consumer spending and we can find no evidence that it is affecting spending on small ticket price items. Certainly, the first few weeks of the Autumn season have been disappointing. However, we believe that the warm start to September has done much more to hinder sales than the political temperature.” Next also says its prices will go down rather than up in event of a no-deal Brexit (although that is not its preferred outcome).Next has also acquired Authorised Economic Operator status (Morrisons has this too and likened it to speedy boarding at the ports). As a precaution it has moved shipments away from the Dover Calais route to alternative ports or airports.Wolfson, whose father chaired the company in the 1990s, revealed that Next is managing to drive its rents down, although only when they come up for renewal. He also quipped:“I remember my dad quipping that a business only discovers its fixed costs when sales decline!”Newsflash: Norway’s central bank has defied the prevailing mood, by raising interest rates.Unlike rival central banks, it has concluded that the outlook requires slightly higher interest rates, saying:Underlying inflation is close to the inflation target. Growth in the Norwegian economy remains solid, and capacity utilisation is somewhat above a normal level. This suggests in isolation a higher policy rate. A higher policy rate may also mitigate the risk of a renewed acceleration in debt growth and house price inflationThese negative rates are in an attempt to prevent the Swiss franc strengthening too much.The SNB declined to match the European Central Bank, which eased monetary policy again last week. Instead, it has pledged to remain active in the currency markets, if needed.European stock markets have opened higher, as trader digest last night’s cut in US interest rates....and Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments afterwards.The main indices are all higher, led by Italy and France.Powell’s message to the markets was broadly this: The US economy is in good shape, but problems overseas and the trade war aren’t helping. We’ll be guided by the data, but it’s best to be proactive. The Fed doesn’t see a recession looming, but we’d take action if we did. Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro financial analyst, says Powell’s optimism may have reassured investors.Overall, Powell was very optimistic about the state of the economy, noting healthy growth rates of employment and consumer activity, despite the lower capital expenditures of companies. Powell’s speech proved to be very convincing, as the economy has recently provided very positive economic data. A few hours before the rate decision, we saw the highest number of construction permits in 12 years. The day before, the Fed had published robust industrial production data, indicating a likely upward reversal in business activity not only in the consumer but also in the manufacturing sector.The Financial Times has spotted that City investors are positioning themselves to profit from a no-deal Brexit (or at least limit their losses!).Investors have taken out a record number of options contracts to bet on or hedge against moves in UK interest rates, amid rising concerns that Britain may depart the EU at the end of October without an agreement on its future relationship with the bloc. Open interest — a measure of traders’ live positions in futures and options on UK rates over the next three months — surged to 18.4m contracts on Tuesday at ICE Futures Europe, the main derivatives exchange in London.The options, if exercised, would allow investors to profit from unexpected rate cuts or protect themselves from the damage stemming from rapid rate rises.Britain’s competition watchdog has waded into a takeover between two UK shoe retailers.The Competition and Markets Authority fears that JD Sports’ £90m deal to buy its smaller rival Footasylum could be bad for shoppers, and will carry out an in-depth investigation unless JD can address its concerns.The CMA said its initial investigation found the deal could result in a “substantial lessening of competition” by removing one of JD Sports’ closest competitors.The CMA is concerned that this could result in a worse deal for customers through higher prices, less choice in stores or worsening customer service. “JD Sports must now address the concerns identified or face a further, more in-depth, investigation,” it said.Colin Raftery, senior director at the CMA, said: “JD Sports is already by far the largest player in the growing sports fashion sector, so any deal that results in it buying up one of its closest competitors could clearly give cause for concern.“Our investigation has shown us that JD Sports and Footasylum have been competing strongly across the UK, with a sports fashion offering that few other retailers are able to match. That’s why we’re concerned this deal could lead to higher prices, less choice and a worse shopping experience for customers.”JD, though, insists that the merger makes sense.Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services is confident that the Bank of England won’t do anything too dramatic today:The Bank of England can safely be assumed to stand pat, being hostage as it is to very elevated Brexit uncertainty, though it will be interesting to see if the minutes suggest any tweaks to its forecasts, even though these tend to be generally reactive....The lower than expected CPI, in no small part due to Clothing, imparts a modest upside risk for today’s Retail Sales, which have defied gloomy signals from most retail sector surveys in recent months. Several other central banks are also setting monetary policy today, including the national banks of Switzerland, Norway, Indonesia, Taiwan and South Africa.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Like Supreme Court justices, central bankers have been the ‘adults in the room’ during these times of economic upheaval.So, after an intriguing Federal Reserve meeting last night, its the Bank of England’s turn in the spotlight today, with the Bank of Japan having already acted overnight - leaving rates on hold.The minutes of today’s meeting, also released at noon, will show the BoE’s concerns about Brexit preparedness and the state of the UK. A gloomy outlook could move the pound.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, says:The Bank of England (BoE) is expected to maintain its monetary policy unchanged at today’s meeting, as Governor Mark Carney will continue assuming an orderly Brexit while keeping an eye on the looming downside risks.With the worst Brexit scenarios fully priced in, the pound traders could find interesting dip-buying opportunities below the 1.25 level against the US dollar. A negative outcome regarding Johnson’s parliament suspension could send the pound rallying past $1.25.Before the BoE’s big moment we get new UK retail sales figures. Due at 9.30am, they are expected to show a slowdown in spending.And while Mark Carney does have a tough job, at least he needn’t worry about being labelled gutless by the prime minister.Last night, Fed chair Jerome Powell earned another blast from Donald Trump after announcing a small cut in interest rate — too small for the president. In response, Powell hinted that the US Economic would be in a better state without the president’s trade wars.The Fed’s decision wasn’t unanimous - while 7 governors voted in favour, two opposed any cut while one wanted a deeper move. The FOMC was also remarkably split over the future path of interest rates.

However, it is the last paragraph of Rzegocki’s letter that has caught the attention of the British media. In a detour that strikes a rather odd tone in comparison with the rest of the letter, Rzegocki exhorts his compatriots to “seriously consider” returning to Poland.To focus on this seems a little unfair in the context of Rzegocki’s broader intentions, but it is characteristic of the conflict at the heart of Poland’s diplomatic response to Brexit. Immediately after the referendum, the then deputy prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, spoke of his regret at “losing” a million Polish citizens to the UK and expressed his hope that they would soon return. As prime minister, he was even more forthright about it: earlier this year, he called for Britain to “give us our people back”.The uncertainty surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU only helps in this objective: in the face of the uncertain process of the EU settlement scheme, and amid concerns about the potential for a no-deal Brexit to create profound economic disruption, many Poles are reconsidering their stay in this country.There are some for whom Brexit is a catalyst for a long-deferred decision about the future. Many Poles originally came only temporarily and remained for much longer than they originally intended. Others are reflecting on the choices they face as they consider starting a family or the need to care for elderly parents in Poland. Most Polish migrants will probably opt to remain in the UK, but it is easy to understand why Rzegocki has sent his letter now.The upcoming Polish parliamentary elections, only a few weeks away, may also have entered into his thinking. The incumbent rightwing Law and Justice government is understandably keen to emphasise its economic record and anxious to make the case that it is taking active steps not only to stem the brain drain but to reverse it.However, attempts to contrast Brexit Britain as a land of confusion with an idyllic view of Poland as a land of opportunity collide with the stories of those who have returned. After years in another country, returning is a process: one that involves many of the same emotional and administrative challenges that are causing Poles to reconsider their lives in Britain.The current crisis is a result of the UK’s decision to leave, but the consular consequences of Poles not applying in time would very much be Poland’s problem, too.Most of the organisations providing support to Poles in the UK are funded by the UK Home Office, with no substantial input from the Polish authorities, who have so far limited their activities to the provision of general information about Brexit on the embassy’s website. Rzegocki is right to stress the risks associated with people not registering in time but given the variety of reasons why most Poles are yet to register, the Polish government needs to do much more than issue vague encouragement. Without a concerted effort to reach all parts of the UK where Poles live and work, and not just the small proportion who take heed of ambassadorial letters, it will be a case of all words and no action.An estimated 100,000 Poles here will participate in October’s Polish parliamentary elections, visiting about 50 polling stations organised by the embassy across the UK. These are citizens who evidently care enough about the future of their home country to exercise their democratic right to decide who will govern it. It could only be a positive thing if the Polish state were to use this opportunity to remind its citizens about the need to formalise their post-Brexit status in the UK, and leave it entirely up to them to make the decision about where they want to spend their future.• Jakub Krupa is a UK-based Polish journalist and social activist "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f97ab3fa6cf0bf19fa9578b6a4df1aa7bbafcc54/0_1604_3426_2054/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55c35cf2784e4ef75e5bbeb146a8e1cd","title":"private schools britain labour unjust","story":"Labour is right to debate the future of these unjust institutions, which at last are no longer seen as untouchableA few years back, I finished a PhD on how to tackle Britain’s unequal life chances – which, among other measures, included abolishing private schools. Dusty academia seemed the home for this sort of proposal, one that has long filled endless papers but never quite makes it off the page and into reality.That is no longer the case. In a few days, the Labour party will debate the future of private schools. The grassroots group Labour Against Private Schools (Laps) will bring a motion to the annual party conference in Brighton calling for the full integration of state and private schools, including nationalising the endowments of the hugely wealthy public schools. It has support from six constituency parties so far and the backing of senior party figures, with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, putting his weight behind the motion this week. A leaked memo to the  last week noted that the party is already considering making a manifesto pledge to remove tax breaks from the sector – while leaving the door open to getting rid of the schools altogether.What feels different now is that these ideas are becoming mainstream at a tipping point in this country. Years of austerity have highlighted the resources gap between the highly funded private sector and the starved state sector. When many working-class children don’t have basic equipment in class, the dominance of elite schools feels even more obscene. The calamity of Eton alumni taking their turn at Downing Street, meanwhile, is now a real-time display of how dysfunctional a nation becomes when structured to be forever run by a tiny pocket of the wealthy.The abolition of private schools is not an outlandish idea but rather an extension of what we already do. Societies constantly set limits on how far a parent can go in giving their child an advantage in life – that’s why it’s illegal for a mother to bribe a university admissions officer to give her son a place, and unethical for a father to do his daughter’s GCSE coursework. This is because it is widely understood that no matter how natural a parent’s desire to do the best for their child, it does not trump the good of society. Other countries, such as Finland, have already acted on this by slowly merging private and state schools.That the recent  front page had to rely on the retro “politics of envy” accusation to describe Labour’s ideas – akin to a playground cry of “You’re just jealous!” – shows how weak critics’ arguments are. In an era in which the damage of inequality is ever clearer and the movements to tackle it are growing stronger, those who cannot comprehend a desire to make life fairer for other people’s children sound increasingly out of touch.It’s clear that tackling private schools alone is not enough to level the playing field, but that there are multiple causes of inequality doesn’t seem a good argument to ignore one of them.The protection of a two-tier school system comes down to a fundamental question about what we think education should be. If we want the education system to be about giving every child a fair shot, then merging state and private schools is the logical move. The question is: what is really stopping our children being educated together?• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c309a708f8e685f1cc068078c744c00ecdb15d1a/0_177_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178b9f41a5cf649d7c8beb86c594d6b5","title":"tiny algae ground zero greenland melting glaciers","story":"Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a bellwether for climate crisis, but the impact on bioersity has been overlooked. At an ice station on a remote Arctic glacier, scientists are looking to the smallest of life forms to predict the pace of species extinctionby  Dan McDougall in Sermilik, 65˚40’ N and 38˚10’ W photographs by Carsten EgevangBehind the remote research huts of Sermilik ice station, a vast sheet of ice stretches north for 1,480 miles, ning an area three times the size of France.Across a narrow granite ravine separating the visitors’ hut from the main living quarters of the 40-year-old international scientists’ base, lab machines click and whirr through the night.The day’s samples – water, air, carbon, algae – spin frantically around curious-looking aluminium discs. Melting ice drips slowly into assorted beakers. Struggling to adjust to the midnight sun, a team of international research scientists from Aarhus University and Germany’s national research centre for solid earth sciences peer into microscopes at clues to the planet’s future. These are samples of glacial past and present, retrieved from the belly of the Mittivakkat glacier, which is in mortal retreat on the plateau above. To understand our origins, scientists look to the stars. To understand our eventual demise, the glacier is ground zero.Long hours are spent on the glacier and even more in the makeshift labs set up in a decrepit series of huts built in the late 1960s on the edge of this lonely archipelago some 40 miles away from the nearest settlement.Archive photographs in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, show that the Mittivakkat glacier’s vast icy mouth opened out to the Arctic Ocean as recently as the 1950s. But to reach its heart in 2019 is a hike many miles inland, crossing rocky terrain in entirely unexpected 23-degree heat. Lichen and unseasonal arctic flowers line the route, as do thirsty mosquitoes, who feast on the moisture of human eyeballs, relenting only at the ice line.Flying over a glacier by helicopter it’s easy to dismiss the landscape as devoid of life, but for the seven scientists at Sermilik hiking over the ice, it is a source of constant fascination for animal and plant life.Alexandre Anesio is a professor in Arctic biogeochemistry from Aarhus University. A charismatic Brazilian, he has a rifle slung over his shoulders – one of four armed researchers, all on constant vigil for the polar bears who stalk the coastline here. He is also probably the worst shot. His young doctoral students, Eva Doting and Laura Halbach, look more keen-eyed, having spent the last month preparing by shooting polar bear targets at a rifle range in Copenhagen.On the ’s first evening, over supper, Anesio explains with earnest patience that snow isn’t universally white. Some of the last snow to lie on the surface of the earth, long after the human race is gone, might even be red. Not blood-red – more a watermelon hue.He also talks about how, in the end, the fate of our glaciers, sea-level rises and bioersity loss, will not only come down to the excesses of the industrial age and our unbridled consumer life, but also to the influence of algae.The sticky green residue familiar from childhood tadpole ponds, as it turns out, could be a microscopic bellwether for this age of extinction.Each year, high on Greenland’s glaciers, algae perform a remarkable migration. After spending winter deep in the snowpack as dormant cysts, they awake in spring and swim through snowmelt, iding and photosynthesising along the route.When they reach the surface, the algae turn black, dark green and crimson – colours that come from astaxanthin, a molecular cousin of the chemical that makes sweet potato orange.The algae produce it as a sunscreen, as it absorbs UV light. As a consequence the humble algae dramatically reduce the amount of sunlight reflected by Greenland’s glaciers and increase the sunlight they absorb, darkening the snow and ice.Most concerning for the researchers out on the glacier is the fact the algae that live on the ice surface in summer are increasingly dark brown, leading them to absorb more sunlight and exacerbate melting.Along with his colleague Professor Liane Benning, Anesio leads a team responsible for this breakthrough discovery.As algae spread, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting. Benning, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences or GFZ in Potsdam, was previously part of the Black and Bloom project to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. She says algae-discoloured snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon.“It’s a global occurrence,” she says. “This is increasingly a problem in the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan glaciers. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica also. What we hope to do is spread our research out further because we believe this is a significant factor in ice melt. This is why we are back here in Greenland but we believe the work also needs to be done elsewhere.”The sound of a city block-sized portion of ice as it separates from Greenland’s ice shelf is unique. A violent sonic boom is followed by an echoing machine-gun style “ak-ak-ak-ak” as the iceberg turns on its axis, before surrendering to the ocean with an eerie silence. There is a sadness to it. On one single day last month, Nasa’s Oceans Melting Greenland project announced that Greenland’s ice sheet had suffered its most substantial single-day volume loss on record, sending an estimated 12.5bn tonnes of ice pouring into the Arctic Ocean – a body of water that could cover the whole of England in five inches of water. If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared tomorrow, sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres and life, as we know it, would come to an end.Sermilik’s scientists argue for serious thinking and funding to understand glacier loss. For Anesio, who left his job at Bristol University, transferring to Denmark because of the potential impact of Brexit on his research, science has to be “something collaborative”.“Our job as scientists is to create more accurate models and add to our global understanding of the climate crisis so that it can be used for politicians to take action – we hope, a little bit faster than is happening now.”As glaciers retreat from India to Greenland, bioersity is being lost. According to the UN one million species face extinction due to human influence. Such a collapse in bioersity would wreak havoc on the interconnected ecosystems of the planet, putting humans at risk by compromising food sources, fouling clean water and air, and eroding defences against extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods.As Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a global bellwether for climate crisis, less focus is being placed on the impact on bioersity.This ice sheet is not just being melted by algae bloom and from above by warmer air temperatures. Arctic waters are reaching record high temperatures and warmer water is lapping against these great glaciers.For Greenland, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, the impact will be felt on land by the nation’s flowers, plants, bushes and heather, its polar bears, caribous, arctic hares, foxes and wolves and at sea by narwhals, seals, bowhead whales and the large variety of unique sea birds.This is bioersity that actually faces few direct pressures from human activities – the major threat is glacial melt and climate crisis. The shrinking of the sea ice area is already having a significant impact on marine ecosystems. It’s an essential habitat and breeding ground for many species, ranging from micro-algae to marine mammals.This is now a hungry time for polar bears struggling to access the sea ice to hunt for seals. An estimated 3,500 of the bears stalk the coastline of Greenland and at Sermilik, stories are swapped of close encounters with the animals.Scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year. The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new, emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the broader world.According to Christopher Trivedi, a US member of the scientific team, communicating the work of the many scientists active across Greenland to local people is a vital and often overlooked part of the job. “I think science communication matters. We need to include the local community here with the work we are doing, and we also have a responsibility to explain the work we are doing here. What we are finding impacts the immediate environment more than anywhere else.”For the younger members of the Sermilik team, the bleakest conversation held at the ice station is around the plastic being discovered.“We are finding plastics in the atmosphere at the centre of Greenland’s ice sheet,” says Dr James Bradley, assistant professor at the Queen Mary University of London. “Millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded into the environment every year and are broken down into small particles and fibres that do not biodegrade. These particles, known as microplastics, have now been found everywhere from high mountains to deep oceans and can carry toxic chemicals and harmful microbes. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Their presence in oceans and waterways has received a great deal of scientific and media attention in recent years, but our growing concern is their presence in the atmosphere.”It is evident that all the scientists feel a growing responsibility on their shoulders to answer questions that have been ignored for too long. This summer, in the face of record ice melt, there is a deeper purpose and an urgency to their work. They want more resources and new technologies to map the details of ice loss with greater precision. They want better global monitoring of nutrients and contaminants that are now trickling at ever higher rates from glaciers into downstream waterways. They want to expand their work to Antarctica and other parts of the glacial world.“To be honest, I’m massively worried,” says Anesio. “I just hope that we are not crossing that tipping point because I don’t think humans can adapt to the rates of changing climates at the moment.”He says that he also has hope, “because I can see a new movement in the young generation that cares. I think that everyone inidually can contribute, by pressing politicians, but also by making their contribution in terms of the reduction of CO2.”Leaving the ice station by boat, negotiating the same narrow channel of icebergs that brought us here, we pass over the shattered remnants of a glacier and stop to scoop a 1,000-year-old chunk of ice from the water. These lumps of ice can only meet one path, drifting out into the Arctic sea at the mercy of winds and warm currents until they break apart into the ocean.Days later, further north of the island, a local ship’s captain summed things up with his Greenlandic dark humour. “That noise you hear out there. The fizzing and cracking,” he tells me, cupping his ear to the wind for dramatic effect as his old wooden ship passes through a fjord filled with decaying mountains of ice.“That noise is the end of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faa2caba3f7f9be916ef58fd217e4a98deaea91c/0_301_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66813a405033246dcfa99b0825051580","title":"penguin wild swimming new zealand australia","story":"Fiordland penguin found 170km west of Melbourne recuperates for eight weeks after 2,500km swim A New Zealand penguin that washed up on a beach in Victoria has been released back to the wild to complete a 2,500km swim home.The emaciated Fiordland penguin was found struggling against rocks in the shallows at Kennett River, 170km west of Melbourne, on 10 July.It was taken to Melbourne Zoo by the marine response unit and given a balance of fluids and nutrients until it was well enough to eat. Once it felt better, said Melbourne Zoo’s head of veterinary services, Dr Michael Lynch, it began to eat with gusto.Once the penguin had returned to a healthy weight – they are usually about 3.5kg – it was sent to Phillip Island Nature Parks to build up its swimming muscles in their larger pools, ready for the journey home to New Zealand.It was released this month after eight weeks’ recuperation.“We are hoping that it will get back to New Zealand and breed,” Lynch said. “We put a microchip into the bird so if it does turn up back in New Zealand one day and someone reads that microchip we will be very happy.”Melbourne is at the outer edge of the normal range for the IUCN red-listed species, which has breeding grounds on New Zealand’s south island and surrounding smaller islands.The global wild population of the penguins, which are listed as vulnerable, is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,600.Lynch said the penguins had previously been very rare in Australia but had been turning up more in recent years, for reasons as yet unknown.“The species is known to forage over thousands of kilometres and we are within the edge of the range of this bird,” he said. “So it is not out of the question that we would see the birds here, but they are certainly a long way from home.”Other penguin species have also embarked on unlikely trans-Tasman trips.In 2014, a Snares penguin dubbed “Miss Simpson” was found on a Tasmanian beach some 2,000km from its home grounds of the Snares Islands, south of New Zealand, and spent nine months in recovery before being released.Scientists in New Zealand recently discovered that a little penguin colony near Otago in the South Island was made up of Australian invaders, little blue penguins that had colonised the area and replaced a similar local species 500 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03509e636ce13eb46347c26f3e58088ad3ce30bd/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7623f788084fe0e649f221d6fd5c55e7","title":"power halve greenhouse gas emissions 2030 climate scientists","story":"Strong civil society movements are needed to ramp up pace of change, says studyGreenhouse gas emissions could be halved in the next decade if a small number of current technologies and behavioural trends are ramped up and adopted more widely, researchers have found, saying strong civil society movements are needed to drive such change.Solar and wind power, now cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions, must be scaled up rapidly to replace coal-fired generation, and this alone could halve emissions from electricity generation by 2030, according to the Exponential Roadmap report from an international group of experts.Avoiding deforestation and improving land management could reduce emissions by the equivalent of about 9bn tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030, according to the report, but contradictory subsidies, poor planning and vested interests could stop this from happening.Key to any transition will be the growing social movements that are pressing for urgent action on climate breakdown. By driving behavioural change, such as moving away from the overconsumption of meat and putting pressure on governments and companies, civil movements have the power to drive the transformation needed in the next decade, say the report’s authors.Christiana Figueres, a former top climate official at the UN, said: “I see all evidence that social and economic tipping points are aligning. We can now say the next decade has the potential to see the fastest economic transition in history.”The experts identified 36 developments that would produce the emission cuts needed, from renewable energy to changes in food production, the design of cities, and international transport, such as shipping. All of them are judged possible to achieve by 2030.“While the scale of transformation is unprecedented, the speed is not,” said Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “This is now a race against time, but businesses and even entire industries have made many significant transitions in less than 10 years.”Social movements will be a top priority because consumers can put pressure on the companies whose goods they buy, and public support makes it possible for political leaders to adopt bolder policies. Countries including the UK, France, Sweden and Norway have adopted a net-zero-carbon target for 2050.Owen Gaffney, the director of strategy at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, a co-author of the report, called on digital platforms such as Facebook, Amazon and Google to play a part.He said governments also needed to do more to support behavioural change, from dietary choices to making public transport more available.However, the detailed policy measures required to meet 2050 net-zero-carbon targets have yet to be worked out by national governments. The report’s authors believe they can demonstrate that taking action now across sectors such as energy generation, buildings, transport and food production and consumption will make it possible. Putting off taking action will result in higher costs and make more rapid change necessary in the future, they say.The need to move to net zero carbon by 2050 – effectively reducing most of the world’s output of carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing the absorption of carbon by vegetation and other means – is based on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.In its report last year, the body of leading climate scientists found there would be dire effects if temperatures were to exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and found reducing carbon to near zero by mid-century was the best way to avoid this.The organisations behind the Exponential Roadmap report included academic institutes, green campaigning groups and private sector companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cc43a37e8117f559534f306a9a3e4b92c064a8/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d5f92bce2223f7a35c6072a18857fa","title":"uks best sea view photography competition 2019","story":"National maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society, has revealed the eagerly awaited results of its seventh annual photography competition, showcasing images relating to all aspects of the UK’s historic relationship with the sea.Having reviewed more than 800 fantastic entries, the judges decided to award Laurence Hartwell the prize for overall winner for 2019, with his entry ‘Landing Mackerel’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c99d6730fa9170b058d877844d97ce3d80e8f3/0_0_5143_3086/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b687a18dff3c7ca26c07f1d6032b066","title":"french fancy parisienne chic from the city of lights in pictures","story":"Tweed skirts and proper blouses.

But behind the pink-and-blue-hued ads showcasing the stars Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B, lies powerful commentary on the nature of female intimacy, a mass market shell hiding surprisingly incisive feminism.Based on a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, the film follows a band of strippers as they drug unsuspecting Wall Street bankers post-recession while running up their credit cards, with Ramona (Lopez) and Destiny (Constance Wu) at the scheme’s helm. Sandwiched between a poppy soundtrack and J-Lo’s acrobatic poledancing are insights on the romance of friendship, capitalism in America and the potential and pitfalls of female solidarity.After seeing Ramona dance for the first time – a glittery display of agile ass-shaking that ends with her rolling around on the floor in a pile of money – bright-eyed and bushy-tailed newbie Destiny tiptoes outside to join her while she smokes a cigarette. Jacketless, Ramona draws Destiny into the warmth of her fur coat. She rests her chin on Destiny’s head. Destiny looks up at Ramona innocently. It’s a scene of startling intimacy and one can already feel the energy between the pair molding into something like love, an early sign of their ride-or-die bond. We’re accustomed to seeing films present sisterly loyalty soon ruptured by jealousy but instead, Hustlers shows something far less cliche.The film, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (a rare female lens for a film about stripping), perfectly captures both the depth and fragility of girlfriends who feel more like family and there’s sincerity within the performances of Wu and Lopez. As the maternal lioness, Lopez exudes warmth while also maintaining her position as the project’s in-control mastermind. For her part, Wu embodies the clever protege gunning for independence, who sees in Ramona both strategy and support. We feel every swell of euphoric acceptance and sting of betrayal between the women. In the end, both are blinded and blindsided by their love for each other.Even as Destiny betrays Ramona, they still part lovingly. Destiny admits she’s accepted a plea deal from the police and for a moment, Ramona can’t contain her feelings. She tries to hold back tears, but her role as the fierce pack mom cracks all the same. When Destiny explains that she took the deal to protect her daughter Lily, Ramona nods her head and gives a tender look of understanding. “Motherhood is a mental illness,” she sighs, before burying Destiny in a hug, only to let her go abruptly and stalk away.Part of what bonds Destiny and Ramona is their shared understanding of what it takes to survive in America. Moving through life by the skin of their teeth, Destiny and Ramona’s Robin Hood plan to steal from the rich to give to the poor only highlights the ways in which the American dream fails women of color.In a subtle yet piercing way, Hustlers calls for an intersectional approach to female allyship. Pressler is played on-screen by a prim Julia Stiles, renamed as Jennifer rather than Jessica, and her scenes with Destiny highlight an ignorance over cultural and class differences which has arguably led to today’s sorry state of female solidarity. While being interviewed, Destiny questions Jennifer’s singular interest in the Wall Street druggings above all else. “Kind of hard not to be,” Stiles replies dismissively. Without missing a beat, Destiny flatly asks where Jennifer went to school (Brown) and what her parents did for a living (a journalist and a psychologist), highlighting the sweeping differences in opportunity between them. Jennifer’s power (and profit) depends on her ability to frame a decision that Destiny is still atoning for. In a recent Vanity Fair article, Samantha Barbash from whom J-Lo’s character Ramona takes her inspiration, claimed that she did not participate in the making of the movie because they did not offer her enough money. “I have bags that are worth more than what they wanted to pay me,” she claimed. This leaves one to wonder if Hustlers has lived up to its own call to action.Male violence also flickers under the film’s surface, the shadow of patriarchy always looming. The tension is most palpable in scenes where the dancers are alone in the champagne room with clients. Money buys sex but the women giving pleasure are completely dispensable to the men receiving it. “It’s OK if you don’t believe me,” Destiny tells Jennifer, “I’m used to people not believing me.” This poignant line highlights the improbability yet vital necessity of women supporting each other at a time when it’s needed more than ever. As the recently surfaced Kavanaugh sexual assault allegations and Chanel Miller’s new book make clear, if women don’t listen to each other, no one will. By the time Ramona’s plot springs into action, no one feels sorry for the trickling bank accounts of the Wall Street tycoons, the context of the 2008 recession allowing for a wider critique of capitalism. “This whole country’s a strip club,” Ramona clarifies, “You have people tossing the money and people doing the dance.”In a year in which gender inequality and the possibility of economic recession remain as worryingly relevant as they did 10 years ago, Hustlers provides a vital and melancholic look at power imbalance in America. It’s a film that points to the country’s own frustrating contradictions – the rising awareness of male toxicity yet the the minimal accountability for it, the feminist movement’s troubling lack of inclusivity – but its sincerity is ultimately most overwhelming. Women are urged to stick together rather than drift apart both in the strip club and in the world at large."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab187d8f312fae4ee3151772e40f86ab54256b42/0_30_1303_782/master/1303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4050351c620fc8ccf3664f0246489f","title":"paris saint germain real madrid champions league match report","story":"This was not a night for galácticos, old or new. At a balmy Parc Des Princes Paris Saint-Germain simply overran Real Madrid, pulling apart the hastily-stitched seams of Zinedine Zidane’s team and producing surely the most coherent and powerful performance of Thomas Tuchel’s time in charge.It felt like a humiliation at times – and by the end perhaps something more, a Viking funeral for a team, an era, a way of trying to win. As the seconds ran out there was even the unexpected sight of the Paris full‑backs Juan Bernat and Thomas Meunier bearing down on the Real goal, the midfield crumbling away like a sheet of millefeuille pastry, the defence drowning in all that space.Bernat took the ball from Meunier. Meunier took it back from Bernat. Meunier might have paused to drink in a most unexpected moment in his own career, but instead steered the ball into the corner of the Real net with a brusque, merciful haste to complete a 3-0 win.And make no mistake, Real stunk the place out in Paris. This was the bones of the same team that completed that unprecedented (in modern times) trio of Champions League wins just 16 months ago. But they were dreadful in the most profound sense dreadful in a way that seems to ask other questions. Such as, what is the point of this Real Madrid team? What is it trying to be? And when will it stop?By the end Luka Jovic, Eden Hazard and Vinícius Júnior had all taken to the pitch. What do these disparate, talented players have in common? How do they fit into a system? Are they anything more £200m worth of expensively assembled whim, a Premier League star here, a Brazilian tyro over there, a Balkan poacher on top?Le Match Des Etoiles! Before kick-off it was pretty clear how French television wanted to pitch this Group A opener, although in the event Neymar, Mbappé, Edinson Cavani and Julian Draxler were all either injured or suspended. Sport may be cruel but it also has an agreeably arch sense of humour. Instead football’s glitziest new-build attack took on Real Madrid spearheaded by Mauro Icardi, on loan from Internazionale, with Erik Choupo-Moting providing back-up from the bench.Madrid were also depleted, but still strong enough to line up with a sub-tier of the merely very expensive and celebrated, with Gareth Bale, Hazard and Karim Benzema in the forward line. This was a night when neither of these teams really seemed to need another industrial-scale superstar. Instead it was the vigour and drive of the PSG midfield that left the 13-time champions looking ragged, with Marco Verratti a brilliantly spiky little playmaker, and Idrissa Gueye gleefully relentless in his pressing and covering.PSG took charge from the start. Bernat produced one thrilling early surge inside Dani Carvajal. It was from there the breakthrough would come. With 14 minutes gone Bernat made the same run, this time feeding the ball into Icardi, then taking a lovely little flick into his path. The pull-back found Ángel Di María. His finish was hard and low, billowing the net from a tight angle.The PSG ultras erupted, a sea of flare-lighting, shirts-off delirium. Who needs £500m of attacking talent when you’ve got an overlapping full-back and a toe-poked near-post finish? PSG had come to press and harry this stately Madrid midfield and at times Gueye and Marquinhos were a blur of malevolent white. With half an hour gone Icardi crash-tackled his way through three Madrid players just to force a goal-kick. On his touchline Tuchel applauded furiously. He may dress like a groovy sixth-form drama teacher but Tuchel loves to see collisions, well-drilled force and endless running in his teams.It was a surge down the right from Gueye that teed up the second goal, the ball fed into Di María, who fizzed a wonderful left-footed shot into the corner from the edge of the area. And for a while as half-time approached PSG threatened to overwhelm Madrid, swarming forward in tight little units, passing the ball with speed and verve.Zidane had to find a way of reversing the gravity of this game. Hazard had been an interested observer in the first half. He dropped deeper to take the ball after the break, but still looked like what he is, a player shaking off the fog of an injury absence.PSG were still hungry. Di María scooped a horribly casual finish over the bar when he might have buried it. Tuchel raged and beat his chest as he stormed back to the bench, but his team kept coming on a night when that air of born-to-rule assurance seemed to have passed, for now, to PSG.It comes to something when a cash-drenched nation-state football project is handing out lessons on the virtues of careful team-building, but Tuchel will be rightly proud of his team’s drive and certainty here. Madrid, for their part, just looked like a mess a superstar vehicle that has, for now, run out of miles to travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975910bbad0ea86c1e2f116271b17103b08832b3/581_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5d457ce7f9760e6e23347a3c8dabfc","title":"we didnt respect the plan pochettino disappointed with tottenham draw","story":"• Spurs threw away 2-0 lead against Olympiakos• ‘The way we conceded the first goal was so painful’Mauricio Pochettino accused his Tottenham players of lacking fight in the 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos and suggested that they needed to work harder on the psychological side of their game.Spurs started badly at the raucous Karaiskakis Stadium only to fashion a 2-0 lead against the run of play – courtesy of Harry Kane’s penalty and a rasping drive from Lucas Moura.But as they had done at Arsenal in the Premier League at the beginning of the month, conceded for 2-1 just before half-time – a body blow to their psyche – and then shipped an equaliser after the interval. After the match, Pochettino did not hold back with his criticism.“I feel very disappointed,” the manager said. “In the first half, I wasn’t happy with the performance. From the beginning we had a plan, and we didn’t respect the plan. That’s what disappointed me the most. I told them at half-time. We scored two good goals but if you analyse the performance only, it wasn’t great.Pochettino was asked about the similarities to the Arsenal game. “It’s easy to explain. When we don’t show the intensity that the competition demands, we struggle. We are not talking about the quality of players. We are talking about focus, concentration, anticipation. How many times did we anticipate the action? How many times were we not productive like we were against Palace?“It’s not about tactics or quality players but the level of fight. You need to match the opponent in aggressivity, excitement, motivation. That is the first demand – you need to work. It’s not only the responsibility of one person it’s everyone’s responsibility.“It is not possible how we started tonight and it is a massive difference to Saturday. It’s a massive disappointment. We can talk about scoring twice and playing better second half, but this season we are conceding a lot of chances and a lot of goals. We need to change that. The only way is to be more demanding. Training needs to be harder. Psychologically harder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec4ce9fbb7534eeb1e412f90f53be88866202bbd/178_569_2940_1764/master/2940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a1618dd563a2fd40805b90c7337e48","title":"astana manchester united upset old trafford kazakhstan","story":"Kazakh side from the furthest outpost in top-level European football includes a United fan who flew to games in ManchesterBy the time FC Astana touched down in Manchester on Monday, they had been in the air for more than seven hours. A quick stop in Riga had lengthened their day and it was little wonder that, whereas most teams travel to European fixtures the afternoon before the game, the serial Kazakh champions had afforded themselves three days to prepare for this one. As far as their body clocks, tuned five hours ahead of British Summer Time, were concerned it was into the early hours of the morning when they finally checked into their hotel and could begin adjusting to the task in hand.For Astana it is hardly an unfamiliar scenario: they have faced similar challenges in the majority of the 35 away fixtures they have contested in the Europa League and Champions League since, in 2013, they took their first steps on this stage. But for everyone else there remains a sense of mystery about facing a team based 3,700 miles from Old Trafford, and three times closer to the Chinese border than to Moscow. It is the furthest outpost in top-level European football a remote new city in a still-new country, and – in the familiar modern-day mould – a sporting project designed to deepen Kazakhstan’s imprint on the geopolitical map.“Life there has been surprisingly good,” says the Icelandic midfielder Rúnar Már Sigurjónsson, who moved to Astana in June after his contract with the Swiss club Grasshopper expired. “It’s a little bit strange, of course, a completely different world a new city with all this strange but beautiful architecture. I had no idea what to expect but it surprised me in a very positive way.”The city of Astana was renamed Nur-Sultan, after the former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, upon his resignation in March. It has rattled through the identities: in the Soviet era it was initially named Akmolinsk and then became Tselinograd, subsequently becoming Akmola when Kazakhstan declared independence in 1992 and then, in 1998, Astana (“Capital”). The vision presented by its modern incarnation, which soars into view from hundreds of miles of steppe, is extraordinary: a disorientating array of glitzy, high-rise, futuristic buildings that outwardly serve scant purpose beyond flexing the strongman Nazarbayev’s oil-funded muscles.A strong football team is another means of doing that and Astana, founded in 2009, are backed by Samruk Kazyna, the country’s sovereign wealth fund. The aim was to give Kazakhstan a Champions League club: Astana achieved that in 2015-16, reaching the group stages and earning four draws against Atlético Madrid, Benfica and Galatasaray. They have not quite managed to repeat the trick but this is their fourth successive appearance in the Europa League if they are not quite a Shakhtar Donetsk then the signs are they have outstripped BATE Borisov, whom they defeated in this season’s play-off and who were commonly cited by club insiders as a reference point earlier in the decade.“The club is doing a lot of things right: well organised, a good structure, everyone working together to be a known team in Europe,” Sigurjónsson says. “I think their long-term vision is succeeding.”Sigurjónsson was brought to Astana by Paul Ashworth, the club’s English executive director. Ashworth arrived in January as part of a boardroom reshuffle and speaks good Russian, having been a coach at FC Rostov between spells managing three Latvian clubs. He oversees a football setup, managed by the Ukrainian Roman Hryhorchuk, that has won five consecutive league titles but is embroiled in a rare three-way skirmish with Kairat Almaty and leaders Tobol this time.“The domestic football is two different things,” Sigurjónsson says. “At home we have a good artificial pitch and a nice stadium, so you know what to expect. At away games you don’t really know what you’ll come across: it could be a grass pitch that hasn’t been cut for a few weeks. The league has probably been a little more even than I’d expected. The players are a bit smaller, more Asian in style: quick and with more technique, good on the ball. But the tactical and physical aspect is not quite the same as we know in European football.”If that is not exactly a slip of the tongue, it does underline Kazakhstan’s wider struggle between European and Asian identities. Winning at Old Trafford would certainly bolster the former and Sigurjónsson, who believes it is “maybe the biggest game in the club’s history”, thinks their prospects should be taken seriously.“I think we have a great chance,” he says. “Of course it’s a romantic idea, but you never know what can happen in football. It’s probably a great time to play them right now they have a lot of injuries and perhaps haven’t found their best team yet.”Sigurjónsson has his own reasons for scouring United closely: he is a lifelong fan who flew regularly from Iceland to attend games – such as the win over Aston Villa in 2009 made famous by Federico Macheda’s late winner – throughout his youth. If Astana, who are typically watched by around 5,000 fans at home league games, need an extra shot of backing they will find 40 of his friends and relatives, all United supporters too but parking their affections for the day, in the stands. The idea of playing at Old Trafford was a dream in his matchgoing days doing so for a team from Kazakhstan is something no career planner could have sketched out.“The world is always getting smaller,” he says. It might not have felt that way during Monday’s journey, but Astana are ready to prove that the gap with their more established rivals is, in football terms at least, narrowing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90fd30cd477514999b33c6b7bb3f872aeba5908/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1569c295da6d1e297ba36b2f3cc4db8","title":"women looking unapproachable could be your greatest asset","story":"Meeting the world with a ‘resting bitch face’ may not be what society demands, but it protects you against unsolicited male attention in publicWith girls as young as 13 years old now opting for Botox, it is clear that ageing is no longer the only thing women are trying to ward off. An article in the New York Post has noted a rise in women seeking plastic surgery to “fix” their so-called “resting bitch face”. This is a women-only affliction, where, even when wearing a neutral expression, you appear perpetually standoffish. In reality, it refers to any time that a woman’s facial expression is set in anything less than a smile.According to one doctor quoted in the piece, the number of requests for the procedure have more than doubled in the past year. This isn’t exactly shocking – women are made to feel bad about just about everything in terms of their appearance – but to me it seems many of these women are getting rid of something that is actually a great asset.In a world where simply being a woman is considered an invitation for unsolicited comments and unwarranted conversation from complete strangers, looking unfriendly is useful armour. It can, at times, be the only barrier between a woman and unwanted small talk on the tube, or a bar. Or on a run. Or on the high street. Or a public bench. Or even while in the middle of conversation with someone else. Heckling and catcalling are rife – should we not at least be allowed to look less than pleased about it?But that would grossly overestimate the amount of emotional intelligence and shame some men have. Because, like anything else, looking grim-faced can be, in and of itself, an invitation. If I had a quid for each of the times I have heard: “Smile, love, it might never happen” shouted at me across the street, I might have the money to rid myself of my own “resting bitch face”. When men say this, it never seems to occur to them that whatever the “it” in question is, it has probably already happened – one look at the world around you should be enough to realise there is often little to smile about. Yet Victoria Beckham’s signature scowl and Kristen Stewart’s tendency to mean-mug have merely culminated in more column inches requesting they turn that frown upside down or, at least, into something that is slightly less offputting.What all this tells us is that women must be amiable and approachable by default. Even when we’re not interacting, we must be poised and primed to do so. Tellingly, there is no “resting grumpy bastard face” equivalent for men – people are far less concerned about faces they don’t deem public property."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca8bf1f41f6d55d8d41cecc6cb2da270dbdc82e/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=716de67b57104a27760c78c11b9ca304","title":"my dear prime minister alan joness apology letter to jacinda ardern revealed","story":"Exclusive: Radio host says he meant ‘no violence’ toward New Zealand PM with his ‘shove a sock down throat’ comment and asks Ardern to a debate on climate change Australian broadcaster Alan Jones’s apology letter to the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spells out he never intended “violence” towards her, and wished no harm on her and her family.It includes the broadcaster pitching for an interview with Ardern despite earlier saying he would “puke” if he saw her again on TV.Last month Jones, of Sydney radio station 2GB, suggested that the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, should “shove a sock” down the throat of the New Zealand leader to silence her views on climate change.Jones said: “This lightweight New Zealand prime minster, Jacinda Ardern, is challenging Scott Morrison over climate change. Now I hope Scott Morrison gets tough here with a few backhanders … hasn’t got a clue this woman.”Jones’s comments were condemned as violent and misogynistic by women’s rights groups on both sides of the Tasman, and more than 100 brands have since pulled advertising from his program. Morrison also condemned the comments.On 16 August Jones penned an apology letter to the New Zealand PM, saying he never intended to cause offence, which has been released to the  under an Official Information Request – New Zealand’s version of FOI.“My dear Prime Minister,” the letter begins.Jones says he and Ardern’s opinions on climate change “differ significantly” and his comments, which don’t need to be repeated, “didn’t come out quite as I intended”.“Prime Minister, I would like to ensure you that I did not intend to suggest any violence towards you,” he writes. “While I may disagree with your stance on climate change, I would never wish any harm to you.“I had meant to say ‘put a sock in it’ and my actual words were taken literally by some who took offence on your behalf.“Please accept my sincere apology for the words spoken, and I hope that my intentions are, at least now, clear.”Jones goes on to say that, if she so wishes, he is happy to discuss the matter by telephone with the PM – and then pitches for an on-air interview.“I would also like to extend a standing invitation to participate in an interview on my programme, which would allow us to constructively debate the issue of climate change,” he writes. “Again, my sincerest apologies and please know I wish you and your family only the best.”Ardern did not take up Jones’s offer of a follow-up phone call, or the invitation to appear on his radio program. She has repeatedly refused to condemn the comments and told New Zealand’s AM show in August that he had a right to air his opinions.“I understand that he of course used to be closely linked to the Wallabies so let’s just say that I think that revenge is best served through a Bledisloe Cup,” Ardern said. “I don’t have an opinion on every single person who says something about me. And particularly given this is an Australian commentator, we’ve got enough of our own to occupy my time without me having to jump into something that an Aussie says.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44be23f818f2edeaf5d43a4044d2338712c48dbd/1124_1020_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33be8d4269f7fd06023a6cba78a49d5f","title":"why cant we agree on whats true anymore","story":"It’s not about foreign trolls, filter bubbles or fake news. Technology encourages us to believe we can all have first-hand access to the ‘real’ facts – and now we can’t stop fighting about it. By  William DaviesWe live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural ides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC’s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion.Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The “mainstream media” is the principle focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking.But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate.This mentality now s the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with “mainstream” institutions has become a mass sentiment.This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable.This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either inidually or collectively.Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are publicly accused of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed “post-truth”). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: iniduals are increasingly suspicious of the “official” stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves.On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions.But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the conspiracy theorist, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world?It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an unimaginable excess of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable.And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions.The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups – millennials or the white working-class, say – are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality.This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become too concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases.The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the anti-vaxx movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society.Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun’s lies about Hillsborough to the BBC’s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s.What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, anti-heroes or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on inidual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment.There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of Ben Stokes and Gareth Thomas, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media’s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain’s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened.The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the “mainstream media”, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased – as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal.Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets.Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is “big data”, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies.The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial.But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today’s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties.The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged “important” to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon’s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately.This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply “speak for itself”. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention – the ultimate in scientific objectivity.Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that “we might describe the contemporary media moment – and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation – as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness”. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data – CCTV, records of digital activity and so on – now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison.One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. “Pics or it didn’t happen” is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that “the camera doesn’t lie” has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is “so show me”.This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them.On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable.On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming – greater than human intelligence can comprehend – our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the “frames” that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning.What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn’t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning.Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person’s offcut is another person’s revealing nugget. Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one’s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as “nutpicking”). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or “fake news”, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation.Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason.The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with inidual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments.Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn mouthing during Prime Minister’s Questions? Who took the photo of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies.While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of “bias” means “that’s not my perspective”. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, “the fundamental question of the web” is: “Why wasn’t I consulted?”What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy.This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the “will of the people” is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the iniduals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently begun to use Facebook Live to speak directly to “the people” from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented.What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to “truth”, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years.What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead?If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes.The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of Rupert Murdoch, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the ision between the two.Then there are those iniduals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and James Purnell. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the Evening Standard, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily , which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the  website proudly includes a “Best of Boris” section.)Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all “mainstream” democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people. One of the reasons they are able to do this is because there is a grain of truth in what they say.The financial obstacles confronting critical, independent, investigative media are significant. If the Johnson administration takes a more sharply populist turn, the political obstacles could increase, too – Channel 4 is frequently held up as an enemy of Brexit, for example. But let us be clear that an independent, professional media is what we need to defend at the present moment, and abandon the misleading and destructive idea that – thanks to a combination of ubiquitous data capture and personal passions – the truth can be grasped directly, without anyone needing to report it.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d492e39e5f9c7fa0597dfc3a4a0ac9fd0f2b2b/0_1027_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36fa1d06a44189862e7f57ad36f577c0","title":"credit card spending overtakes cash for first time","story":"Credit card spending has overtaken cash for the first time, according to data from UK retailers.

It said it was working to ensure the long-term viability of ATMs and reduce barriers that prevented many businesses from offering cashback to customers.A BRC spokesman said that with card payments rising, it was vital the government tackled these costs. “Without action we will see businesses put under further pressure and it will be consumers who are forced to pay the price,” the spokesman said.

The back of my car was smashed and the interior covered in glass. If anyone had been inside they could have been killed.Tesco has been very difficult to deal with. On the advice of the store manager, I called my insurance company, which organised a repair that took two weeks. During this time my insurer and I tried repeatedly to get Tesco’s accident management company to take action. Four weeks later it wrote saying I should use its authorised repair company. By this time the car was already repaired.I still have not had my insurance excess of £100 refunded, as the claims management company has not refunded the cost of the claim to my insurance company. After many fruitless calls, I received a £100 Tesco card to compensate for the inconvenience. However, this does not compensate for the two weeks without my car, the cancelled travel plans, the effect on my future insurance premiums, the £100 excess and the hours of phone calls.When I emailed the chief executive I received a reply saying that they considered the matter closed.SW, GlasgowTesco seems remarkably laid back about your appalling ordeal. “As SW decided to go through her own insurer, her insurance company would need to pursue a claim with us,” it says. “We can confirm that we have not received anything to date.”It ignores the fact that comprehensive insurance policy holders have to lodge a claim through their own insurer, and that its own store manager advised you on this.Moreover, your insurer has given you a timeline of its unhelpful contacts with Tesco’s claims handlers since May.Happily, Tesco’s insurers have finally paid up, so you have been refunded the excess. After the Observer got involved you were invited to claim for uninsured losses while your car was out of action, and you have now been offered £200 by Tesco’s insurer.Meanwhile, Tesco insists on restricting its contrition to a voucher.

Sordid tales of late-night drives, suicide, desire and femme fatales with killer smiles. Beautiful piano, dirty guitar, and Mark Lanegan lending his devilish tones. The score to the best film noir never made.For me, The Rising by Bruce Springsteen has got to be in there. That someone 30 years into their career can write a requiem for America in the post-911 age is astonishing in itself. This album restarted his career, which had tailed off in the 90s, and includes some of his best and most poignant work. Come on, rise up!‘A solid piece of Americana’: Shoe Banerjee, 37, Boston, MassachusettsI just think it’s a great album and a solid piece of Americana. It cemented Green Day as a serious band with serious artistic cred. I listened to it on a loop in my car for about two years straight after it came out, so I sort of maxed out on it – but it’s still (as a whole) my favourite album of the century.‘A breath of fresh air’: Stevencharles71Where are the Libertines? Either of the first two albums, but the second album in particular? After the previous decade left guitar music on a life-support machine, with Britpop (there were a few exceptions, but not Oasis or Blur) the tumour at the centre of the disease, the Libertines were a breath of fresh air, with two incredibly strong albums and the only real competition for the Strokes during the earlier years of the 21st century.‘Any of her albums deserve to be on this list’: pennerigate‘An incredible piece of work’: junglist92I would have liked to have seen the inclusion of Dillinja’s Cybotron. Truly, music that changed the face of the drum and bass scene. It elevated him to the title of the King – and you can hear it and more importantly feel it in this album. I’ve never heard anyone else use the lower ranges of sub-bass to such devastating effect. It is an incredible piece of work. I remember seeing people on dancefloors literally stop dancing and shaking their heads in disbelief, in awe of what they were hearing, when any number of tracks from this album came on.I’m disappointed there was no room for Bob Dylan’s Shadows in the Night. His best album in a long time, and vocally he is at the top of his game. It’s a cover album of songs previously recorded by Frank Sinatra and the band treat the songs with respect – the arrangements are fantastic. I suffer from terrible earworms and this album is one big earworm for me. I still wake up with different songs from it whirling around my head.‘Pushes the boundaries’: RadioHedgeFundAn astounding album by a true visionary, TBU pushes the boundaries of what is possible in music. Brian Transeau experimented with rewiring old instruments, writing his own audio software from scratch and even creating his own instruments to create a soundscape unlike anything else around.‘Music made by far-future aliens’: dhollidayMy favourite musician behind only Pink Floyd. Tanetsveta is an epic trip into what our reality sounds like if we had no frequency filters. Alternatively, think of it as music made by far-future aliens who are attempting to communicate with us. At over two hours long, with an at-first impenetrable, punishing, heavy-speed sound, it’s not an easy listen! But the layers and melody it reveals are cosmic, after breaking in you’ll start to hear more ambience than heavy. Truly transcendental. I know each tiny lick by heart, it’s become a familiar comfort.‘He revolutionised the genre’: mattjedgeOne glaringly obvious omission (to me, at least) is the Weeknd’s Trilogy. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, sure, the lyrics are dark and misogynistic and downright uncomfortable to listen to at times – but it’s difficult to listen to modern R\u0026ampB without hearing its influence everywhere. The darker sound, slower pace, sparse sampling. He revolutionised the genre.‘Cool electro with a hint of glam’: lotusblue‘Its only failing is it was never released on vinyl’: 1789wasAgoodYearMy favourite album of all time is from 2002 – Hallucinogen’s In Dub. I grew up on classical music, but got into electronica through Tangerine Dream and the new wave of the 80s into the 90s. This is Simon Posford remixed by OTT. This album ticks all the boxes for me. Its only failing is it was never released on vinyl.‘He had a new vulnerability to this voice’: Huw EdwardsOn his first album since being diagnosed with a neurological disorder in 1997, the 68-year-old Johnny Cash had a new vulnerability to his voice. When he sings, “There’s no sickness, no toil nor danger in that bright land to which I go,” he sounds like a man ready to go home.‘Hawkins has the talent to execute what he’s learned’: stripsidebobThis album is definitely in the Top 10. Justin Hawkins is a student of rock and has the talent to execute what he’s learned. He’s also, by turns, Partridge-esque, witty and an arch ironist. There are some people you meet who can elevate a social gathering by force of their generosity of spirit and natural good humour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

We recognise the unique history and geography, I think to go back to my language of 10 August,” she said.“We have to recognise that we are in the UK and sometimes I think people forget that.”She said her party was looking for a “sensible deal” and it never wanted to inflict no deal on the region.“The presentation of the DUP as a ‘no deal’ party is wrong. People get very alarmed when they see that sort of rhetoric, We do want to see a deal but it has to be a deal that works for everybody,” she said.The backstop has the support of industry and farmers, who have said that no deal could have disastrous outcomes for Northern Ireland. The Stormont economy department has said it could cost 40,000 jobs.The letter could be characterised as a plea for a soft Brexit. It envisaged a deal that would ensure new arrangements did not disrupt the peace process and accommodated the “particular significance for the agri-food sector and animal health” in border regions.It also noted it was critical that businesses were protected on the border and did not incur additional costs, suggesting the DUP could accept regulatory alignment if a Stormont assembly had a say in what EU rules would apply.In a separate interview with RTE, Foster said the so-called Stormont lock – a promise to consult the Northern Ireland assembly on any no-deal arrangements – was being misrepresented as a veto on future EU regulations.“We’re not looking for any control over the European Union, what we are looking for is control over what happens in Northern Ireland and I think that’s a very fair thing to search for,” she said.The DUP is hoping a shift in its position will be met with a compromise by the EU and the Republic of Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd1eb209b9fe87850a7aad493f2f1581e471430f/0_83_2637_1583/master/2637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac7f1075677648780039b00f8ff3f05","title":"david cameron saying queen purred down line terrible mistake","story":"Ex-PM tells Today programme he regrets comment made after Scottish referendum resultDavid Cameron has admitted it was “a terrible mistake” to announce the Queen had “purred down the line” after he phoned to tell her Scotland had voted no to independence.In a wide-ranging interview on the Today programme as part of the veteran presenter John Humphrys’ final show, the former prime minister also accepted “a big share of responsibility” for the situation the UK faces, but said there had been growing pressure throughout Westminster for a referendum on EU membership.On the day his memoirs were published, Cameron defended his time in Downing Street and listed a number of achievements, including Michael Gove’s education changes and Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare overhaul, but he conceded he should not have made the remarks regarding the Queen.“I don’t want to say anything more about this, I’m sure some people would think it may possibly even be that I have already said perhaps a little bit too much,” he said.The former Tory party leader added that his comments at the time – declaring the monarch had “purred down the line” to him following the no result – were a “terrible mistake” for which he apologised immediately.However, he said he did not ask the Queen for “anything improper” during the referendum on Scottish independence.Challenged over his stepping down following the UK’s decision to leave the EU, Cameron said he would not have been the person to deliver Brexit after campaigning for remain despite claiming he would have delivered the result of the 2016 referendum.He said he had not wanted to resign so quickly after the vote and hated giving the impression he was running away. However, he said he would have lacked the credibility a prime minister needs.Discussing the decision to hold a referendum, believed by many to have been an attempt to remedy isions within the Conservative party, Cameron said it had come from “honest” motives, referenced “growing problems” with the EU and said there was an increasing appetite for a referendum in the UK.However, he noted: “Do I accept a big share of the blame for the difficulties that we face in our country, do I think about it every day, does it pain me to see our politics frozen and our society ided? Yes it does, and I do take my share of responsibility for that, of course.”He was then questioned further over accusations that the country had been left unprepared for a vote to leave the EU.“I don’t think there was a huge amount more that could have been done than setting out the alternatives, recognising then that I wasn’t the right person to take this country forward, and giving the next prime minister the chance to choose between those alternatives,” he said.Nevertheless, Cameron said he had fought hard during the referendum campaign and claimed the Labour leadership had not been committed. “I wasn’t the slightest bit complacent, I worked incredibly hard,” he said. “There is still time for him to take the best path, which is get the deal, take it to parliament and try and win over people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b6f7e976d4f6275047584af31288451549c78e/227_468_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1708d394bec60cba8925b107244d06a5","title":"david cameron sought intervention from queen on scottish independence","story":"Former PM admits he wanted ‘raised eyebrow’ from monarch in referendum campaignDavid Cameron has revealed that he suggested to the Queen’s private secretary how the monarch could influence the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, before she went on to make an intervention that was widely seen as helping a faltering pro-union campaign.Cameron, as prime minister, was on a weekend break at the Balmoral estate in the Scottish Highlands in September 2014 when a YouGov survey put the campaign for Scottish independence in the lead for the first time.In the second part of a BBC series about his life in politics, which is to be broadcast next week, Cameron says the poll hit him “like a blow to the solar plexus” and led to “a mounting sense of panic”.He says: “I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen’s private secretary and I had with the Queen’s private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even you know a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference.”The equivalent of a raised eyebrow came a week later when, outside Crathie Kirk, the church where the Queen attends Sunday services while at Balmoral, a woman disclosed in widely reported remarks that the monarch had offered a coded warning about the impending referendum, telling her: “Well, I hope people will think very carefully about the future.”While the  has reported that Sir Jeremy Heywood, then cabinet secretary, and Sir Christopher Geidt, then the Queen’s private secretary, had discussed how she might register her concern at the prospect of a yes vote for independence while remaining “impartial”, Cameron’s remarks are an explicit admission that he sought intervention.The remarks are likely to be provoke the ire of Scottish nationalists.Pete Wishart, a Scottish National party MP, said there was no doubt the Queen’s remarks had an impact on Scottish voters, particularly those who had not decided which way to vote. “We knew Cameron was up to something at the time and for him to explicitly chronicle how he approached it, almost strategically, is almost beyond belief,” Wishart said.The revelation is potentially the most controversial element of the programme Cameron Years, the first episode of which will be broadcast on Thursday with a focus on the lead-up to the referendum on Britain’s EU membership.George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer in Cameron’s government, is particularly critical of Cameron’s approach, saying: “David Cameron was just one of a number of British prime ministers who had fed this idea that we were different than Europe, that Brussels was to blame, and that the public ultimately had to have a say – and we’ve all paid a price for it in my view.”Osborne and Cameron have also spoken openly about the increasingly fraught attempts to convince Michael Gove to be on their side. Gove tells the programme that he felt “some of the conversations we had were attempts on his part to reassure himself that our friendship would mean that I wouldn’t stray from the fold”.Others involved in the Tory government at the time also speak of how the emotional ties due to the closeness of Cameron’s family with Gove’s family had an effect on decision-making, coming to a bitter head when Gove, then education secretary, was demoted. Gove was moved in the reshuffle of summer 2014 to the post of chief whip. Cameron says Gove had wanted to become chief whip and speaks of his surprise when the other sent him an email in the midst of the reshuffle saying that he did not want that job.David Laws, a Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition government, tells the programme that the consequences of the breakdown of the relationship between Cameron and Gove were enormous for the future of the country.“Quite simply,” he says, “we might never have had that referendum vote to leave the European Union without Michael’s demotion in 2014.”In a preview of the series this week, at the BBC, the executive producer Denys Blakeway said that during hours of interviews Cameron was asked if he felt any remorse over the EU referendum. The former prime minister chose deliberately, he said, to use the word “regret” instead.Boris Johnson had agreed to be interviewed for the programme but cancelled on two occasions, according to Blakeway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81202ca1f6ee92bb837cec30411111cf8ab4ec08/0_1_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34592821af48910b1b0cd41ec6baabb2","title":"viral stars brexit britain eyeroll girl ana telma rocha","story":"Every day, ordinary people seem to cut through political debate and speak truth to power. But what is it like to go viral and how does it change their lives?“People have died because of austerity,” a woman told Boris Johnson, buttonholing him in Doncaster last week. “And you’ve got the cheek to come here and tell us that austerity is over and it’s all good now.” It was her words, caught on cameras and phones, that hit a nerve, because she spoke for so many. No one remembers what Johnson said, or what he was doing there. Only yesterday, a man with a sick daughter berated the PM in a London hospital over waiting times, and on years and years and years of the “NHS being destroyed”.A couple of weeks earlier it was the Portuguese woman who hijacked a live Sky News broadcast with an emotional plea. After 20 years living and working in Britain she didn’t know whether she was still welcome. “I need a voice, I gave this country my youth,” she said. “I looked after your children, I’ve looked after the elderly.”And who can forget Brenda from Bristol. “You’re joking!” she spluttered at the man from the BBC, when he asked her about Theresa May’s decision to hold a snap election. “Not another one! Oh for God’s sake, I can’t stand this. There’s too much politics going on at the moment.” Brenda was surprised by the fuss, then annoyed. “Oh God no, go away,” she yelled from a window at some journalists recently when they called for her wisdom. These are the viral stars of Brexit Britain, the ordinary folk who are suddenly and briefly catapulted into the limelight. With a sentence or two, or just a look, they strike a chord with the nation. What is it like for them? What happens after their brief moments of fame? Does it make any difference? I caught up with a few – all of them women, because, interestingly, most of them are – to find out.Harriet Ellis was in the queue to board the flight for her holiday. “The woman in front and her boyfriend kept taking selfies,” she remembers. “I was like: that’s so weird, why do you want to remember this moment, being in the Ryanair queue? And I kept getting in the picture, so I was dodging, I didn’t want to ruin this moment for them. Then I looked over at her phone and I just saw loads of pictures of my face. The woman had Googled me and was checking the picture to see if it was me.”Ellis’s eyes are a legend. They achieved this status in November when their owner was sitting right behind Nigel Farage in a Channel 4 Brexit debate. It was his claim that Theresa May was delivering a “remainer’s Brexit” that caused them to perform what has been described as a “double axis roll”. The clip went viral, Harriet became #EyeRollGirl.She was a student at Birmingham University at the time and got an email asking if she wanted to be in the audience for the debate. “I was like: I might as well, I’ve got nothing else to do,” she says. She is interested in politics and has always talked about it at home: “I know a bit, not like loads.”She was not aware of the roll at the time, didn’t even know she was a roller, although afterwards her mum told her she’d had plenty of practice she had spent years rolling her eyes at her. But after the debate someone asked if she had checked her phone. “Oh God, is someone dead? No, but there were 3,000 views on this gif, and I was like: wow, that’s fun. Then we were in the car on the way home and it just snowballed. If people were concentrating on my eyes it mustn’t have been that interesting a debate.”In the morning, her phone wasn’t working. “It overheated from all the notifications. It took a while to calm down, I had 68,000 likes in 24 hours.” On the way to her interview she spoke to newspapers and magazines. “You feel like you’re on top of the world. I think it helped with the interview.”Anyway, she got in, and will start the course this autumn – teaching in a secondary school (religious education, not politics). Does she think she has got Farage to thank for her career? “He did give me some confidence,” she says.Extraordinarily, in the referendum, Ellis voted to… leave! (Now who’s doing the double-axis eye-roll?) But this had nothing to do with Farage. “I was at sixth form at the time this was my first time voting I was very interested in Lexit, leftwing Brexit, reading about how the EU promotes the immigration of white westerners and is sort of like a racist ideology in that it is at the expense of immigration from more deserving countries and people of colour. Also I didn’t like the fact that you didn’t know who was running it you didn’t directly vote for the people at the top, and no one knows who their MEP is.” She would probably vote differently now though, because of the way it has turned out. “It’s an omnishambles, as Malcolm Tucker would say.”Ana Telma Rocha came to this country from Portugal in 1999. It made her into the liberal, tolerant person she is, she says. “I was super-Catholic, a xenophobe, I thought gay people were dangerous. It educated me, it’s been wonderful and I love it.”But, she says, recently the UK has become unrecognisable. In 2016, she was walking down the street in Sheffield, where she was living with one of her two sons. A man accelerated towards her at a crossing, stopping only metres from them. “He said: ‘Go back to your country, foreign scum.’”.That’s when she decided her boys – one of whom has autism – would go to live in Portugal while she stayed here to work. “The toughest decision,” she says, choking up. She moved to London, to carry on her work as a carer for an agency. She gets moved around the country when we speak she is on her way to a job in Suffolk. She has also worked as an actor.She was not arrested, but she did interrupt a Sky TV broadcast covering the protests. “I need a voice,” she said, passionately. “I’ve worked here for 20 years and I have no voice. The resettlement scheme is not working.” She did not realise it was a live show. “I thought, I don’t know, that they’d cut it, because I was just another nutter off the street. But then everybody started to ring me and I thought: ‘God, this has gone a bit mad.’”Soon she became Portuguese Brexit Woman, getting sympathy and abuse, especially when it emerged that she had helped set up a theatre company. She was a planted remoaner stooge, it was clearly fake news. “I knew that as soon as they found out I’m an actress they would say it was fake news,” she says. “But there were many more nice messages than – sorry – those idiots.”Rocha’s main issue – like many other EU citizens in the UK, has been the laborious process – of applying for the EU settlement scheme having to navigate seemingly endless technical issues, error messages and helpline hell while working up to 65 hours a week. Not as simple as the Home Office made out. But since her impassioned TV outburst, she has heard directly from the Portuguese consulate, which has offered to help. “I’m actually quite proud of Portugal,” she says. There is no such warmth towards Johnson. “God forgive him for what he’s done to England.”Amelia McDowell, 16, remembers getting the call. She was in the middle of an art class, at her school in Belfast. “I checked my voice messages and there was this really posh British woman. I said to my teacher: ‘This is important, do you mind if I get it?’”The teacher agreed, McDowell went into the art cupboard, sat down among all the paint and the clay and called the woman back. “She’s asking me all these questions and I try to answer as best as I can with these pots of paint falling on my head, then she’s like: ‘That’s brilliant, we’d love to have you, we’ll send you the tickets.’ I hung up and just screamed.”Tickets to a concert? The X Factor? Oh no. “I burst out of the art store and went, to my whole class: ‘I’M GOING TO BE ON QUESTION TIME!’”McDowell watches the BBC politics debate every week. When there was an announcement that the show would be coming to Belfast (“It never comes to Belfast!”) she immediately applied to be in the audience.A few days later, Dad dropped her off at the venue. “I knew I wanted to say something but it wasn’t like I had completely thought it out, it was mostly spontaneous.” What she did, when she got the chance, was to calmly deliver a damning indictment of the Conservative party. “David Cameron made the referendum policy because he didn’t want to risk losing 10 or 15 seats to Ukip, and look where it has got us,” she said. “This has always been because Tories are playing party politics with issues that are going to be huge, generational changes for all of us.”She was soon being hailed for her eloquence and clarity. She set up a Twitter account, wrote: “Hi, this is me,” under her clip, and collected 8,000 followers overnight. Celebrities – Rob Delaney, Richard Bacon, Amanda Abbington – were retweeting it here was the human embodiment of the argument to give the vote to 16-year-olds (a campaign that McDowell is now part of).In English class the next morning, “friends kept refreshing their phones under the desk, and going: ‘It’s on 215,000 views now.’ I remember when my mate Erin just stood up and said it had hit a million. That night my friend Amy rang and she’s like: ‘Mimi, your video’s on Jeremy Corbyn’s Twitter!’ Then I checked my Twitter and like John McDonnell’s followed me! What’s going on?” It was really good, to have a platform at last, and to know people don’t actually think you’re talking crap when it comes to politics. But also part of me is like: there are like so many young activists my age or maybe a bit older who maybe have an understanding like mine or close to it but didn’t have the chance to go on Question Time and say something. That was luck and I’m very thankful for it.”McDowell has certainly used her moment in the spotlight: she has been on the radio and written articles, and says she would have done more if her GCSEs had not got in the way. She is at sixth-form college now doing French, English language and biology. Not politics, incidentally. “I don’t want to seem up myself but it’s mainly things that I do already have a good understanding of.” That is very clear. As well as school, and school orchestra (violin), she is a Labour party of Northern Ireland youth activist.At the end of her Question Time speech she called for a general election. Is that still what she wants? “There’s obviously the danger of being so close to Brexit now, and I am quite worried that it will become another Brexit election, and we will end up with the Tories again, but I think Boris Johnson’s recent moves have been an electoral disaster. I do not think he’s going to get back in. So honestly part of me really wants an election because we probably would get an extension to do it and I think another government would get in even if Labour needs to be propped up for a while.” After college, she hopes to go to university – Oxford is the aim, otherwise Edinburgh or UCL – to study French and Russian, and then eventually go into politics. There were people saying she should be prime minister after Question Time what did she make of that? “I’m not saying right now, but maybe in the future like, if the opportunity comes up I’m willing to take it.” #VoteMimiWhen Kirsty Archer complained to her landlord about the state of disrepair of the London flat she rented, she was served with an eviction order. Then, following the announcement that the government was going to scrap these section 21 eviction notices – which enable landlords to evict tenants for no reason at all, so long as they give them two months’ notice – she agreed to be interviewed on Sky News. It did not quite go as expected.“I thought if you are a case study you would have the chance to talk about what happened to you,” she says. “But it didn’t really go like that. She was quite critical of me it emerged during the interview that she had been a landlord herself. I was quite surprised about the line of questioning.”She is the Sky journalist – and landlord – Jayne Secker. “That’s just the housing market isn’t it?” Secker said to Archer, on air, about the extortionate rents in London. And she went on to have a moan about some of her own experiences renting out properties to young people who don’t know how to do anything around the house and can’t even change a lightbulb. It had gone from a piece about scrapping section 21 to the woes of being a property owner, and Archer came away thinking it had gone really badly. “She said at the end that I swore, and apologised for me swearing.” (Archer had used the term “pissed off”.)Archer’s flatmate – and fellow evictee – did not think it had gone so badly for her, and did the sensible thing in the situation: he uploaded the clip to Twitter. Two days later – after retweets from, among others, Owen Jones, Philip Pullman and Ellie Goulding – it had garnered 4m views. The story then not only returned to being one about renters’ rights, but now it also became one about patronising journalists who are wildly out of touch with the living situations of the nation’s young people, and woefully ignorant of the renting crisis. Secker ended up apologising, saying that she “got the tone and content of an interview wrong” and had “taken the many comments on board”.“Obviously it resonated with a lot of people,” Archer says. “I think one of the nicest things was all the comments from random people online saying well done and it’s so good you are speaking out for us.”Archer works for the charity Rethink Mental Illness and knows a thing or two about the link between housing and mental health. She is one of the lucky ones she got a platform. Since – and as a result of – her TV appearance she has been to the annual OECD forum in Paris, sat on panels, spoken in schools. “I think it shows that if people take action and are willing to do something rather than just letting it happen, then they can actually change things and help maybe more than just themselves.”The renting situation is still rubbish. The ban on letting fees is positive, likewise scrapping section 21s, although that hasn’t come into effect yet, and who knows when it will, with everything else going on. Archer is renting a new place in Streatham, south London, £675 a month plus bills. The washing machine broke, but it got fixed. “The landlord is a lot more reasonable this time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c55007810f2b4f7c29b5ad4a73a58e7aa2a6ec5/0_400_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23cd43cf058062dfef582ca2021cacbd","title":"dust cloud sparked explosion in primitive life on earth say scientists","story":"Smashing of monster asteroid half a billion years ago thought to have caused mini ice ageAn enormous dust cloud that swept through the ancient solar system sent Earth into a mini ice age that sparked an explosion in primitive life on the planet, scientists say.The space dust was created when a monster asteroid was smashed to pieces in a violent collision somewhere between Mars and Jupiter nearly half a billion years ago.The destruction of the 93-mile-wide space rock scattered so much dust into the inner solar system that it blocked some of the sunlight falling on Earth, the researchers claim. As a result, temperatures dropped for at least 2m years.Because the cooling occurred over such a long time, life on Earth had time to adapt. And while many species carried on unaffected in the warmer spots near the equator, others evolved to make the most of the world’s freshly-formed colder regions.“This the first time it’s been shown that dust from an asteroid break-up can lead to cooling that triggers an ice age on Earth,” said Birger Schmitz, a professor of nuclear physics at Lund University in Sweden. Evidence from rock formations suggests that Earth experienced an unusual, short-lived ice age about 466m years ago. The drop in temperature locked water into ice that covered much of the planet, causing sea levels to fall globally. The period coincided with an apparent surge in the ersity of life on the planet, most of which was still in the oceans.In the hope of shedding light on the mysterious ice age, Schmitz and his colleagues went looking for clues in ancient limestone rocks exposed at sites in southern Sweden and near St Petersburg in Russia. In particular, they looked for remnants of the huge asteroid, which geologists call the “L chondrite parent body”.The researchers used acid to dissolve more than a tonne of limestone rocks of different ages from the sites. They then picked over what was left behind. They found that after the asteroid’s destruction, the abundance of grains matching its chemical make-up rose by between 1,000 and 10,000 times. The levels stayed high for 2m-4m years. “The grains come with the dust so when you see an increase in these, you know there’s been an increase in the dust,” said Schmitz.Further tests on the ancient limestone revealed a similar spike in levels of an isotope of helium that streams out of the sun in the surge of particles known as the solar wind. The researchers believe that the helium was brought to Earth when it became embedded in the finer space dust particles as they travelled through the solar system.Writing in Science Advances, the team describes how dust and coarse-grained particles from the asteroid’s destruction rained down on Earth and became locked into sedimentary rocks. “We can nail that this ice age started to form when the dust from the break-up fell to Earth,” Schmitz said. The asteroid still accounts for about a third of the meteorites that land on Earth.Scientists call the apparent explosion in marine life at the time the Great Ordovician Bioersification Event, or GOBE. David Harper, a palaeontologist at Durham University who worked on the study, said it was “the most spectacular hike in marine ersity in the history of life”.“Ice ages have been associated with major volcanic eruptions, but for the first time the team has implicated asteroid-derived dust in the initiation of global cooling and a major leap in bioersity that changed marine ecosystems forever,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eba8bb10d4686ac99fc92ae17ba6ab402e7a2b4/0_62_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59124025712d633bf8724207b269319c","title":"universal credit wait fuels poverty and food bank use says research","story":"Government urged to reduce five-week wait claimants must endure before first paymentMinisters have come under renewed pressure to fundamentally overhaul universal credit after fresh research claimed that the welfare benefit’s built-in five week wait for payment fuelled claimant poverty and increased food bank use.The Trussell Trust food bank network said the minimum 35-day wait for payment endured by claimants after signing on to universal credit could have a rapid, devastating and long-lasting impact on their finances, housing security and mental health.Claimants unable to cope without income during the waiting period faced destitution, Trussell said. They were unable to afford food, frequently went without meals, failed to pay utility bills, ran up rent arrears and risked eviction.The research cited the case of John, a man with severe mental illness, who did not eat for nine days after being left with no income after claiming universal credit. His health had declined to the point where he “didn’t feel well enough to leave the house to get a food bank voucher”.Government measures to mitigate the negative effects of the five-week wait were either limited or failing, Trussell said. Repayable advance loans issued to claimants to tide them over simply created long-term difficulties for claimants as they paid them back, in effect leaving them “deciding between hardship now or later”.“Universal credit should be there to anchor any of us against the tides of poverty. But the five-week wait fatally undermines this principle, pushing people into debt, homelessness and destitution,” said Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie.The scale of the problem was underlined by separate research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which estimated that that two in five families set to move on to universal credit in future – about 2m households – will be unable to meet basic living costs during the five-week wait.The foundation said there was “nothing compassionate or just” about the five-week wait for an initial payment, which it described as “immoral.” It backed Trussell’s call to shorten it, saying that universal credit was forcing families to go to food banks when it should be helping to reduce the need for them.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) dismissed the Trussell Trust report as unsubstantiated and based on unrepresentative data, and insisted its advance loans were working as intended. “It categorically does not prove that universal credit is the reason behind increased food bank usage,” a DWP spokesperson said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the five-week wait was wrong and advance loans were not the answer. “Labour will stop the rollout of universal credit and ensure that our social security system lifts people out of poverty and supports any one of us in our time of need,” she said.There are reports that the Labour party is set to announce that it will “scrap” universal credit at its annual conference next week. A year-long review of party policy is said to have recommended that it should adopt a policy of “transformative change” to make the benefit fairer.The design of universal credit built in a six-week waiting time for a first payment – later reduced to five weeks – to put claimants on to a monthly-in-arrears payment cycle, paid electronically, ostensibly to reflect the world of work. The benefits it replaces typically had a 15-day wait for payment.However, the designers seemingly failed to recognise that substantial numbers of claimants were used to one or two-week payment cycles, and few had sufficient savings to tide them over a lengthy period without income, making their transition to the new benefit an often traumatic struggle.Universal credit bundles together six working-age benefits into one monthly payment. It was originally due to be fully operational in 2017 but the current deadline is 2023, when about 7m people will depend on it. A devastating auditors’ report last year found it was unlikely to deliver planned financial savings or employment benefits.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the Trussell data echoed its own findings. “It’s clear, from the findings across the charity sector helping universal credit claimants, that the system is not providing everyone with the financial safety net people need,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b041656a657b845393a8dc034a4ce0047d5d7d6/0_294_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a46ea59dd75a7d00a55881b6a69d06","title":"talking horses are female punters discriminated against by bookies","story":"A trader with a well-known betting brand suggests practices could breach gender discrimination lawsAre some of Britain’s major bookmakers guilty of gender discrimination when they sign up new customers? The question arises following a conversation with a former employee at a major bookmaking firm, who suggests practices in the gambling industry could breach discrimination laws.The source of the claim worked as a trader with a well-known betting brand for almost 10 years until earlier this year, says firms routinely discriminate between male and female punters from the moment they open an account, purely on the basis of their gender.The development of internet betting over the last 20 years means that modern bookmakers have many times more customers than would have been the case 20 years ago, and often process huge numbers of bets at a bewildering speed, in particular in the moments leading up to the start of a big sporting event. As a result, all firms have sophisticated systems in place to defend their margins, and restrict or refuse bets from the most successful punters.The relative unprofitability of betting accounts opened by women when compared to those of male punters is also well known in the industry. It is possible that women are simply shrewder gamblers than men, but it is also likely that traders fear accounts opened by female customers are being used as a front by “faces” – punters who have previously been banned for winning too much money.“Where I was working, when you called up the details of an account, the page was flagged up in pink if the holder was a woman so you couldn’t miss it,” the ex-trader claims. “But I don’t think this is just something that was happening where I was working. Most of the big firms use the same software, and this is something that happens industry-wide.”The Equality Act 2010 allows service providers to provide “separate” services for men and women if it is a better or more effective way to conduct their business – but only if they can demonstrate that there is a valid reason for doing so. So the question here may be whether a bookie’s fears that big-hitting winners could be hiding behind new female customers are sufficient reason to treat those customers differently “from day one” solely on the basis of their gender?LadbrokesCoral, William Hill, Bet365, BetFred and Paddy Power were all asked on Wednesday what percentage of their account holders are female and whether they are satisfied that their business practices and procedures with regard to female customers are fully compliant with current gender equality legislation.As yet, only LadbrokesCoral have responded. The make-up of our customer base varies by brand, product and territory,” a spokesperson said. “For commercial reasons we don’t disclose specific details. In all cases we abide by gender equality legislation and our communication with our customers is based on their inidual playing preferences and not their gender.”If minds need concentrating, a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission, the industry’s regulator, said on Wednesday that any breach of equality laws by gambling firms could potentially be a threat to their licence to operate.“Were licensees found to be in breach of anti-discrimination laws this would certainly reflect on their suitability to hold an operating licence,” the spokesperson said. “As the gambling regulator we expect operators to protect their customers from harm and treat them fairly.”Ayr has had its share of problems in recent years, most obviously when the three-day Western meeting, including the Ayr Gold Cup, was abandoned in 2017 due to a small patch of unraceable ground on an otherwise raceable track. But that issue has since been addressed and even the weather seems to be behaving itself before this year’s edition, with plenty of sunshine and unseasonably warm temperatures forecast for all three days.The ground is likely to be drying steadily as a result but it remains good, good-to-soft in places at the moment and that should be ideal for What’s The Story (3.30) as he steps out of handicap company for the first time in the Listed Doonside Cup. Keith Dalgleish’s gelding looked better than ever when successful off a mark of 103 at York last time and does not have much, if anything, to find to see off this field. Queen’s Sargent (2.00) should go well in the seven-furlong handicap earlier on the card while Equidae (3.00) and the evergreen B Fifty Two (4.30) are also fairly priced. Punchbowl Flyer (1.50) has strong claims in the opener at Yarmouth, while the game and improving Anna Bunina (3.10) has an excellent chance to complete a hat-trick at Pontefract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecff1029900cec14746bf0c7df2c0b80164212a9/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b3c7d0e16c664b7714bfc003fba6be5","title":"best comedians of the 21st century comics standup comedy","story":"From apocalyptic standup Frankie Boyle to the many hilarious faces of Tina Fey, Steve Coogan, Sharon Horgan and Kristen Wiig, we present the funniest comics of the eraby  Hannah J Davies,  Paul Fleckney,  Harriet Gibsone,  Brian Logan and  Stuart HeritageThe queen of indie comedy announced herself as a sweet-natured woman-child, making not so much shows as scrapbooks of the things that made her big heart burst. Then, just as the coalition government came into power, the girl from Orpington pivoted towards outraged political comedy. She has gone on to become one of comedy’s most articulate chronicler of the left’s beleaguered decade. But what’s consistent through both incarnations and into her recent show about motherhood is a personality that fizzes with fun and – Tories be damned! – an indomitable love of life. BLTheir Brentford-set series followed a group of loserish friends, but its creators are anything but. Asim Chaudhry, Allan “Seapa” Mustafa, Steve Stamp and Hugo Chegwin gave the mockumentary a millennial spin with a web series that caught the eye of Office producers Roughcut. Over five series, the group nailed subcultural satire by drawing on their experiences in the world of garage MCing, making for a show that was authentic and absurd. With PJDN now over, the group seem to have the comedy world at their feet, with a film and a US version on its way. HJDWhile Coel’s statuesque skills have been lent to more serious thespian pursuits recently (2018’s Black Earth Rising), her self-penned series Chewing Gum was a landmark. Based around Tracey, a neurotic 24-year-old living in a tower block in London, the show had all the appeal of an Inbetweeners-era coming-of-age sitcom (such as the scene in which she tries to lose her virginity in a disabled loo). But with its misfit lead navigating her sexuality and identity, it was a revelation for a generation of black women who were previously made to feel invisible in comedy. HGHad Mindy Kaling just written and appeared on The Office (US), revitalising a flagging show with her livewire neediness, she’d make the list. Had she only written the books Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) and Why Not Me?, she’d make the list. Had she only made The Mindy Project, she’d make the list. Had she only written and starred in the Emma Thompson film Late Night, there’s a good chance she’d make the list. But she’s done all of these things, so question her place here at your peril. SHSuspend your expectations of comedy: like his hero, the great Dutch comic Hans Teeuwen, Brookes is here to scramble your sense of what’s happening on stage, what’s up next and why the hell you’re laughing. Maybe his antics – eyeballing his crowd, absenting himself, stretching his sinewy frame into odd shapes – relate to the currents of talking about incest, eco-angst and existential despair that pass for his material. Or maybe they’re just what this “hipster Nosferatu” finds funny. Either way, you can’t take your eyes off him. BLFans of the barrel-chested comic may have first witnessed him in Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, where his poker-faced arrogance became the stuff of cult worship. His roles often come from an alternate version of the 70s - his sophisticated, Bafta-winning Toast and its excellent interior design and music being one of the most innovative comedies on TV in years. While his face does minimal work, it’s his voice – described as “part bounty hunter, part 70s porn star” – that has soothed this century, from his BBC shorts to The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, Snuff Box, House of Fools and yoghurt adverts. HGWhen Cardinal Burns arrived on the comedy circuit, it was obvious from the quality performances, the sharp script and the range of characters that Seb Cardinal and Dustin Demri-Burns had talent. When their TV break came (on E4 then Channel 4), it wasn’t just funny, it was a cinematic treat, both in how it looked, and how the sketches were like entire worlds to immerse yourself in. See their suburban Banksy, the Made in Chelsea spoof Young Dreams, and one-off sketches (their Clowns sketch is a beauty). PFHannibal Buress would almost certainly like to be known for more than just being the guy who made a joke that triggered Bill Cosby’s downfall. But in the US at least, Buress has long had a following, thanks to TV specials, late-night chatshow appearances and his role in Comedy Central sitcom Broad City. His onstage style is relaxed to the point of almost complete stillness, a sort of mumblecore standup. It is a red herring, though, as his material is astute and often fearless. PFThe Glasgow comic, real name Brian Limond, is a rare thing in comedy: a comedian not known for panel show appearances or TV roles but rather for his online notoriety. His DIY efforts led to a linear series, Limmy’s Show on BBC Scotland, but his success has largely been on his own terms (think podcasts, blogs, tweets and clips on now-deceased video service Vine). Dark, subversive, weird, sad and absurd yet universal, Limmy proves that doing it your own way – via the odd fake obituary – is a risk worth taking. HJDThe “comedian’s comedian”, Lee is known for his meandering, oddball tales and surreal projects such as Jerry Springer: The Opera. Bridging the gap between 90s standup and the present (his influence is clear on bright, bizarre young things like James Acaster), Lee’s recent show, Content Provider, tackled Brexit with brilliant amounts of bathos (“Ooh no,” he coos on stage, “I only wanted bendy bananas, and now there’s this chaotic inferno of hate!”). HJDStandup in the 21st-century has been more emotionally intimate than anything we’ve seen before – and no one bares more soul than Simon Amstell. Having started the millennium hosting trashy C4 show Popworld, a flit to standup recast this celebrity irritant as one of our most intense, and most fretful, comedians. His over-thinking, self-abasing work – minutely chronicling the emotional life of a gay, Jewish, vegan B-lister who questions everything – s live comedy, cinema and sitcom (BBC2’s Grandma’s House), and is always brilliantly alive. BLFor much of the millennium so far, British telly has been searching for its own Daily Show – a stringent, sassy topical comedy vehicle to help shape the nation’s political conversation. The closest it’s come has been The Mash Report, whose very own Jon Stewart is the standup Nish Kumar. A multiple Edinburgh Comedy award nominee, London boy Kumar is the smartest, and often the silliest, political comic we’ve got: acute, furious and often the ridiculous fall guy of his own jokes. BLNow that Jordan Peele is a full-blown Hollywood darling, it’s easy to forget where he came from. And that’s a remarkable shame, because he came from Key and Peele, a Comedy Central show that burnished the art of sketch comedy to a golden sheen. Almost every sketch it ever produced is a masterclass of the form perfect little nuggets of set-up, escalation and pay-off. Substitute Teacher, I Said Bitch, Turbulence, Outkast Reunion these are all on YouTube and will improve your afternoon a hundredfold. SHAs sketch comedy disappeared from TV screens, you could have been forgiven for thinking the artform was moribund. Far from it: the ex-Footlights trio Sheeps have twisted it into new shapes – most notably in 2014 show Wembley Previews, which featured one sketch, repeated in a dizzying array of styles. As if that weren’t enough, one-third of the team, the morose Yorkshireman Liam Williams, launched a voice-of-his-generation solo career, which blazed across the standup stage and brought us the hit BBC4 YouTube spoof Pls Like, and People Time, made with peers Claudia O’Doherty, Jamie and Natasia Demetriou and Ellie White. BLCult comics Tim and Eric nailed the nightmarishness of American excess way before Trump-induced anxiety spread across world. Dragging a Gen X cynicism into the present day, their creations reflect the incessant yammering of advertising, reality TV surrealism and the onslaught of online images and information. Some of their humour has no deep meaning, either: the greasy-haired spook Spagett, waxy entertainer Casey Tatum, and heartbreak horror of Carol and Mr Henderson. From their Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! series to web shorts such as Tim’s Kitchen Tips, their layered, abstract nihilism basically invented meme culture. HGYes, comedy has to be funny – but it can be mind-expanding, too, and never more so than in the work of Sara Pascoe. Even before her bestselling book about the female body, Animal, the Essex-born comic wore her erudition – and anthropological way of seeing the world – on her sleeve. The result was a series of cracking standup shows applying Pascoe’s loveably nervy intelligence to pair bonding, Nietzschean philosophy, “sperm selection” – all the big questions, in other words, and never a hack gag in sight. BLTwenty years back, few had mime and clowning pegged as the hippest strands of 21st-century comedy. No one’s played a greater role in their revival than Phil Burgers – AKA sexy clown-comic Dr Brown. A graduate – like so many of the saucer-eyed acts who followed – of Ecole Philippe Gaulier in Paris, Burgers developed an instant cult following with his silent, late-night shows: beautiful, skilful and playful, but also terrifying, in that Burgers displayed zero inhibitions and required his audiences to leave theirs at the door. An Edinburgh Comedy award followed Burgers’ influence is still being felt on live comedy. BLA man with such comic gift he can make an HSBC advert watchable. Ayoade’s dry-as-a-bone humour may be an acquired taste, but it hasn’t stopped him piecing together a career of unusual breadth: as host of gadget and travel shows, a deft movie director, the droll voice of sanity in panel shows, author of two impeccably written books, and, perhaps most inspired of all, presenter of The Crystal Maze. His most straightforwardly comic role to date is as Moss the uber-geeky IT technician in The IT Crowd. The appearance of Ayoade in any show is a seal of quality. PFBridges was already marked out as a standup wunderkind before his brilliant debut show in 2009 aged 23. He’s barely put a foot wrong since, and now rivals Michael McIntyre as Britain’s finest exponent of that much-maligned form, observational comedy. What Bridges brings to it is a punchiness that never tips over into aggression, and an intelligence that steers him away from cheap shots and dumbed-down material. And best of all, he’s a rare example of a mass-appeal standup who has the courage to be openly political, and the charm for it not to be isive. PFYou wouldn’t want to be Amy Schumer. She releases a standup set (The Leather Special) and has to defend herself against rightwing trolls determined to reduce its Netflix rating. She releases a movie (I Feel Pretty) and has to defend herself against leftwing trolls who form a consensus about its message based purely on its trailer. This weight of expectation would crush most people, but not Schumer. This is probably because she is very, very funny. Watch Trainwreck, or Mostly Sex Stuff, or any episode of Inside Amy Schumer for proof. We’re lucky to have her. SHPut aside, if you can, his tabloid ubiquity and ropey oeuvre of Hollywood films. Turn a blind eye to his questionable role in the 2015 general election. Brand the cultural phenomenon isn’t always a laughing matter, but Brand the comedian is harder to resist. On stage, where he can control how the narcissism, verbosity and new age philosophy come across – and where they’re spliced with wit, self-mockery and a palpable love of people and life – Brand is a presence to conjure with, one of our most unique and charismatic comic talents. BLAnsari has had a career of two halves. First, he was the playful standup whose routines revolved around clashing cultures and botched romances, a style translated into Netflix’s Master of None. When allegations of sexual assault were made in 2018, it seemed his career might be over for good. He has denied claims, no charges were pressed, but Ansari is now tackling the subject in his work a review described his new tour as “a cry against extreme wokeness”. Whether he can regain his former success remains to be seen, but he’s determined to use comedy to make a statement. HJDWhen Daniel Kitson won the 2002 Perrier award, breakout success seemed just a matter of time. But that’s not what Kitson wanted. The Yorkshireman has since constructed the most respected bespoke career in comedy. He doesn’t do telly, panel shows or media – yet his gigs (sometimes standup, sometimes plays, sometimes solo storytelling) often sell out far in advance. And his voice is among the most distinctive in comedy: barbed but romantic, blunt but lyrical, fiercely protective of humanity’s fragile flame as the chill winds of soulless modernity billow around it. BLWhen he was team captain on Mock the Week and best known for comparing a swimmer to a spoon, few would have nominated Frankie Boyle as one of the comics of the century. But that was before the Glaswegian’s transformation into the most lacerating comic-critic of Tory Britain. On stage, in his newspaper columns, and on his terrific BBC show New World Order, Boyle has retained the brutality and joke-writing brilliance of his early work, but applied it to sociopolitics over celebrity. Boyle 2.0 is the appalling, apocalyptic comic-poet our end-of-days era demands. BLMost assumed that The Daily Show would end when Jon Stewart quit in 2015. To all intents and purposes, the show was Stewart intelligent, probing, angry and humane. So what do you do when you have to replace the voice of a generation? Easy, you find another one. Enter Trevor Noah. He’s younger than Stewart, and much slicker, but his Daily Show has finally found its voice. Noah is such an outsider – not only a foreigner, but a South African born to interracial parents at the height of apartheid – that his point of view can’t help but stand out against those of the white male Jimmys that make up the rest of late night TV. SHWhen he played the O2 in London in 2013, on the back of the cult success of his autobiographical sitcom Louie, Louis CK was greeted as the world’s best standup: a philosopher with great jokes, and a pitiless chronicler of the foibles of the midlife male. Then in 2017, several female comics alleged he had sexually harassed them. CK confessed, and withdrew from comedy – but not for long enough, say critics of his recent comeback. No one denies he delivered some brilliant standup in his pomp – but all those cynical gags about predatory maleness no longer sound quite so funny. BLDespite reaching their anarchic zenith in the 90s, the pair segued into the 00s with hits such as Shooting Stars (which ran until 2011), lost classics such as Catterick and Vic and Bob’s Afternoon Delights, as well as sitcoms (House of Fools) and reboots (Big Night Out). They’ve also prospered independently and in the most surprising places – Bob’s able to turn a panel show such as Would I Lie to You? into an odd Audience With performance. Between them they’ve survived a triple heart bypass and a visit to the I’m a Celebrity Jungle, to remain the reigning champions of surreal comedy. HGGadsby’s 2017 show, Nanette, was supposed to be her last before quitting comedy. An attack on homophobia and sexual violence, and an outpouring of pain and anger, Gadsby – a dry, modest comic from Tasmania – also turns her fire on standup itself, for giving the illusion of helping her mental health. Nanette was so bold, timely and devastatingly well written, that it’s taken on a life of its own. A Netflix special was a huge hit, and she has, thank goodness, reversed her decision to quit the business. PFFrom Ali G to Borat to Brüno, Sacha Baron Cohen’s audacious trolling and timely satire has made him one of comedy’s best-known provocateurs. His style might not feel as edgy as it once was, and there have been some blips along the way (see 2012 film The Dictator). However, when he gets it right he can still make a huge impact, with latest series Who Is America? highlighting the ludicrousness of US politics. HJDThe sadcom is the subgenre that takes the darker elements of the human condition – the ones previously reserved for standup – and fuses them with the tenets of TV comedy. Arguably, no comic has nailed this auteur trend better than Notaro, whose Amazon show One Mississippi focused on an annus horribilis that included the death of her mother, her cancer diagnosis and a breakup. In the wake of its (unpopular) cancellation, she brought her mix of deadpan and emotion to a Netflix special, Happy to Be Here, sealing her reputation as a pioneer of “traumedy”. HJDUS comic Rae harnessed the power of the webseries in the early 2010s, with her YouTube comedy The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl landing her a place on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Entertainment List in 2012. While an early project with Shonda Rhimes was canned, Rae’s star rose via her HBO series, Insecure. In a world still bound to tired stereotypes of alternately fierce and subjugated black women, this pop culture-heavy comedy stood out, as did the voice behind it, who plays the lead role with an understated confidence and, of course, lashings of awkwardness. HJDThe criticism commonly levelled at mid-career Ricky Gervais (the arena standup the outre awards host the man who made and played Derek) is that he’s turned into – or perhaps always was – his Office alter ego David Brent, forever tittering at how provocative he can be. Which at least goes to show what an unforgettable comic monster Brent was in the first place, a middle-management pipsqueak with delusions of charisma, fronting a pioneering cringe comedy and still-brilliant mockumentary nailing the pettiness and desolation of workplace life. BLNo one with half a brain ever doubted that female could be funny. But feminism? Even Bridget Christie fought shy of the subject early in her career, when she stepped out as a daft sub-surrealist in disguise as Charles II. Or an ant. But then came A Bic for Her, her breakout 2013 set, a fantastically daft – yet fiercely committed – cri de coeur against everywhere sexism. Alongside the book, and the radio show, Christie has gone on to enjoy a brilliant career in campaigning comedy, and not only for feminist causes – sometimes it seems that there’s nothing this terrific clown can’t make funny. BLRanganathan was on the brink of quitting comedy when he won the Leicester Mercury comedian of the year contest in 2013. Since then, the former maths teacher has done everything from presenting a travelogue with his mum (BBC3’s Asian Provocateur) to making a sitcom based on the real-life story of inheriting his dad’s pub (The Reluctant Landlord) to presenting a hip-hop podcast, as well as being a Mock the Week fixture. While he has stated that he doesn’t do “Asian comedy … I’m just an Asian man who happens to be doing comedy”, race features within a self-deprecating, off-kilter style. HJDTo call someone “random” may be slanderous in 2019, but when the Boosh arrived in the mid 00s with their hermaphroditic mermen, talking gorillas and giant lumps of evil bubblegum it was an illuminating antidote to the bleak mockumentary realism of the comedy that was booming at the time. Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt’s Boosh radio series introduced listeners to the zooniverse of strange wonders, but their 2004 TV show was totally transportive: from its art school aesthetic to its dreamlike characters, it was as visually stimulating as a Jim Henson creation, or like stepping into a Frank Zappa album. HGHis reputation has been damaged lately by some unpleasant material on gender – even if the 2017 Netflix specials in question went on to be the channel’s most watched comedy specials of all time. But for years, you’d have struggled to find a more authoritative standup worldwide than Dave Chappelle. Live performance aside, he entered the big league with Chappelle’s Show, the trailblazing sketch series that made a whole new kind of merry with race, politics and pop culture. Its status – and Chappelle’s no-compromise reputation – was secured when the star mysteriously quit the programme mid-recording in 2006, triggering a seven-year sabbatical from showbiz. BLTo watch a Maria Bamford standup set is to sprint full-pelt to keep up with her train of thought. Other comedians might take the time to state and reinforce a premise before launching into their punchlines, but not Bamford. Her sets are a free-associated cavalcade of broken logic and weird voices, and it often takes full concentration just to figure out what’s going on. Watch 2012’s The Special Special Special! if you haven’t already. It’s Bamford performing standup for just her parents, and it is glorious. SHPolitical views can kill a comedian’s mojo (hello, Eddie Izzard). So what will happen to Sarah Silverman? Her early standup persona was a sort of narcissistic brat with no boundaries. Then she got politicised. Silverman’s reaction to the rise of Donald Trump has been not just liberal rage, but attempts to reach out to his voters and understand them. Will this new-found earnestness kill her comedy mojo? It appears not. Her latest Netflix special, A Speck of Dust, shows she can inveigle her politics into her standup without compromising either. She’s a remarkably gifted comic, with incredible control and courage – that she is still evolving makes her all the better. PFFormer SNL cast member Amy Poehler got her big break as Pawnee’s most enthusiastic public servant on Parks and Recreation. Poehler’s hyperbolically feminist Leslie Knope pokes fun at lean-in culture, while also cementing the actor’s reputation as a master of weirdo characters. It’s a trend she continued as a mentor for Broad City’s Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, helping to bring their show to TV and acting as its exec producer. HJDMost SNL performers simply slope off when their time is up, but not Kristen Wiig. Her final episode, after seven years on the show, ended with a Lorne Michaels slow-dance as Mick Jagger sang Ruby Tuesday to her. By that point, of course, she’d already written and starred in Bridesmaids – a hit so colossal that it tends to overshadow her other work. Stick a pin anywhere in her filmography, though, and you’ll strike gold. Plus she’s playing the baddie in Wonder Woman 1984, which is likely to vault her into the stratosphere. SHHorgan has gone from portraying young drinking, shagging women (Pulling), to dysfunctional grown-up relationships (Catastrophe) to motherhood (Motherland) – and has nailed them all. Each show has been wickedly warts-and-all with almost documentary realism. Catastrophe remains the pick of the bunch, managing to be both funny and touching, and in Sharon and Rob she has created a comedy couple that will endure. PFThe first half of this decade saw an extraordinary flowering of creative live comedy centred around north-London production house The Invisible Dot. Jonny Sweet, Claudia O’Doherty and the stars of the Inbetweeners all made work here – but the flagship act was poet and performance-art comic Tim Key. Every Key show was an event, designed to upend – and expand – expectations of live comedy, and seduce us all with Key’s coy and slippery humour. A role as Alan Partridge’s sidekick gained Key wider recognition, but the live work is his indelible signature. BLEven during the six-year stretch when Curb Your Enthusiasm was off air, Larry David was funnier than anyone else. His Broadway play Fish in the Dark won rave reviews and millions of dollars in advance sales. His TV movie Clear History was much better than it should have been. And, in 2001, he wrote the world’s best op-ed on baldness. “If a hair guy has a girlfriend, he’s never threatened by a bald man. He doesn’t mind if his girlfriend has a platonic bald man in her life. ‘Come on in, bald man, make yourself at home.’” SHImagine how rubbish life would be without Julia Davis. Imagine how much happier the world would be. Everything Davis has written has been soaked in the worst excesses of human misery, but with a worrying degree of relatability, showing up the vulnerabilities of all of us. Human Remains was full of delusion. Nighty Night was a study of sociopathy. Hunderby exposed the dark guts of our period drama fetishisation. Camping felt like being drugged unconscious and dragged into the forest by woodspeople (or a clingy boyfriend). Her latest, Sally4Ever, is possibly her darkest yet. Even in the quaint format of the podcast – Dear Joan and Jericha – she manages malevolence. Inexplicably, she has not created a dud in her career. A spectacular achievement. SHHaving come up through standup and recurring sitcom spots, Haddish hit the mainstream with a breakout role as wisecracking Dina in the 2017 film Girls Trip, a comedy that put the spotlight on black US sisterhood. Haddish has since gone on to be the first black female performer on Saturday Night Live, and written a book, The Last Black Unicorn, about her difficult childhood and taking up comedy as an alternative to therapy. HJDNo comedy career this century has been as remarkable as that of Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, low-key Kiwi musical comics turned accidental global superstars. But if the scale has changed – from a dank cave on the Edinburgh fringe, via BBC radio, to breakout HBO sitcom success and award-hogging movie careers – the quality of the duo’s musicianship, wonderfully unexpected lyrics, and their deathless deadpan banter has remained hilariously sky-high. Business Time, The Humans Are Dead, Carol Brown – their comic songs are among the finest ever written. BLChris Rock was already a star at the turn of the millennium but the 21st century turned him into a megastar. His first two standup specials since 2000, Never Scared and Kill the Messenger, are full of trademark Rock fury but the third, last year’s Tamborine, is quieter and more humane. Plus in this time he made Everybody Hates Chris, Top Five and The Motherfucker With the Hat. That Chris Rock is one of the funniest people alive goes without saying. The scary thing is that, after 30 years in the business, he might actually be getting better. SHYes, there is Alan Partridge – a character of such magnitude that lesser comedians would have given up at that. But in addition, Steve Coogan has starred in three series of The Trip, seamlessly blending travelogue, impression show and gloomy indie drama into a brave new form all of its own. His film work has lurched from critically celebrated highbrow comedy (24 Hour Party People, A Cock and Bull Story) to hugely underrated would-be blockbusters (Hamlet 2, Around the World in 80 Days). And he’s Alan bloody Partridge, for crying out loud. Surely that’s enough by itself. SHTina Fey is having quite the busy century. In 1999 she became Saturday Night Live’s first female head writer, winning the show its first best writing Emmy for 13 years in the process. In 2004 she wrote Mean Girls. From 2006 to 2013 she wrote and starred in 30 Rock, winning 112 Emmy nominations along the way. In 2011 she was paid $6m to write Bossypants, opening the floodgates for dozens of essay collections by female comedians. She co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. She executive-produced Great News, one of the best lost sitcoms of our age. She has rapped with Childish Gambino. She performs the definitive Sarah Palin impersonation. She is one of the very few non-obnoxious people ever to host the Golden Globes. And she isn’t slowing down, either her new NBC sitcom – in which Ted Danson will play an obnoxious mayor of Los Angeles – sounds like it’s going to be a slam-dunk, and she’ll soon star in what’s likely to be the most successful film of her life in Pixar’s Soul. She remains precisely as exacting, hilarious and influential as she’s ever been. Remove any of her projects from your life, with the possible exception of Wine Country, and the world immediately becomes a much worse place. A true legend.

More than a handful, members of the shared office space WeWork found out this week.Employees of an unnamed company renting space in a Washington DC WeWork building returned to work after the weekend to find they were unable to enter the office – an umbrella had fallen sideways, jamming the door.Neeraj Agrawal, a spokesman for cryptocurrency non-profit Coin Center, tweeted photo evidence of the predicament, which quickly went viral.As the tweet made the rounds, dozens of armchair door-un-jammers weighed in on the best options to free the umbrella and get the workers inside. Among the suggestions: cut a hole in the door, drill a hole in the wall next to it or shimmy a wire through the crack in the door. But none of these solutions worked, said Mike Ponticelli, an employee who talked to Vice.“Two of my coat hangers went down in the fight,” he said. “It was a ‘does not compute’ moment, because the situation had absolutely no apparent solution.

Police are hunting a hoodie-wearing assailant who fled on foot.Wiersum was the lawyer for a state witness named Nabil B in a case against two Moroccan-born men dubbed the most wanted criminals in the Netherlands.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the killing in broad daylight in the capital was “incredibly disturbing” and that police were “on top” of the situation.“This is very alarming news. The police and the public prosecutor are investigating,” Rutte told reporters.The two suspects, Ridouan Taghi and Said Razzouki, are the subject of international arrest warrants for murder and drug trafficking.The lawyer’s murder came a year after Nabil B’s own brother was shot dead, raising questions about why Wiersum was not provided with better security.The justice and security minister, Ferd Grapperhaus, said he has set up a team of police and prosecutors led by the country’s counter-terrorism coordinator to intensify security around people working in the legal system.“This is an attack on our constitutional state,” Grapperhaus told reporters in The Hague, adding: “Organised crime has crossed a line.”One of Wiersum’s two children was at home at the time of the shooting, De Telegraaf newspaper said. Police covered his body with a white sheet while forensics teams investigated the site.“This is unprecedented,” Peter de Vries, one of the Netherlands’ best known crime reporters, told BNR news radio.Amsterdam has long been known for its tolerant attitude towards marijuana, but a report commissioned by the city council earlier this month said it now had a major problem with drugs.The report, titled The Other Side of Amsterdam, said that “drug-related organised crime - the ’underworld’ - exerts a significant influence on our city.”One of the main Dutch police unions said the shooting showed the situation in the Netherlands was getting out of control.“This is a confirmation that we live in a narco-state”, said Jan Struijs of the NPB police union. “It is an attack on the rule of law.”In 2018 the union made a similar warning, saying that the government and politicians underestimated the scale of crime, corruption, threats and money-laundering in the country.Meanwhile, a man died of his wounds after gunmen on a scooter fired shots at his car on Wednesday evening.

On Weibo, the video and a discussion thread about it has been viewed more than 32m times since it emerged on Friday. The video was covered by most major media, including the party paper Beijing Youth Daily and state broadcaster CCTV and China Daily.Some believed the visible part was just the top of a much larger animal, which netizens soon called the “Three Gorges Water Monster”. Some theorised whether pollution in the river could have given rise to the creature. Scientists dismissed any idea of a new species, saying the creature was most likely a giant water snake.But on Tuesday, workers at a ferry pier downstream from the reservoir fished out a long piece of tubing, likely discarded from a shipyard. Photos from local media also showed another large piece of black rubbish washed up on the shore near the alleged sighting.The Yangtze, Asia’s longest largest river, stretching from the edge of Tibet to China’s east coast, is now one of the most polluted as a result of industrial growth and overfishing. Environmental advocates believe those effects have been compounded by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, completed in 2012, the world’s largest hydropower project.An estimated one third of fish species in the river are endangered and the baiji dolphin, believed to have lived in Yangtze for more than 20 million years, has become extinct.While some observers lamented the end of the tale, and the poor video quality giving rise to theories of a sea monster, others said local authorities should maintain the mystery.One said: “Don’t take it out of the water. Seal the area, turn it into a tourist attraction and open it up to the world.”“Disappointed.

Gantz is due to speak at 2pm (1200 BST).The change of strategy reflected the weakened position of Netanyahu, who heads the rightwing Likud party, after he failed again in Tuesday’s election – which followed an inconclusive ballot in April – to secure a parliamentary majority.Netanyahu said: “During the election campaign, I called for the establishment of a rightwing government but to my regret, the election results show that this is impossible.“Benny, we must set up a broad unity government, as soon as today. The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation.”Likud lawmaker David Bitan told Israeli Army Radio: “Everyone will need to get off their high horse to prevent elections for the third time. Blue and White’s desire for a unity government under their terms will not work.”On Wednesday, Gantz said he hoped for a “good, desirable unity government”. But he has also ruled out forming one with a Netanyahu-led Likud, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.Many Israelis hoped the poll would provide clarity and pull the nation out of a political crisis. But the muddy results that trickled in on Wednesday appeared to deadlock the country instead.With nearly all votes counted on Thursday, the Blue and White party stood at 33 seats in Israel’s 120-seat parliament, and Likud at 31 seats.Netanyahu, is not only fighting for his political life but also potentially his freedom, with pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him opening in just two weeks. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant the 69-year-old immunity from prosecution.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.Speaking on Wednesday evening, Netanyahu insisted his party and its rightwing allies had chosen him to remain leader, even as it was unclear how he would form a government. “We decided unanimously that we’re going forward together to negotiations that will establish a government led by me,” he said.Late on Wednesday, he cancelled a trip to the UN general assembly next week, in order to deal with the political crisis at home.Gantz, a former general, has looked to centre and leftwing parties. But even those deals fall short of a parliamentary majority of 61 seats.In the middle stands Israel’s seeming kingmaker and staunch secularist, Avigdor Lieberman, who has called for a secular unity government of Likud, Blue and White, and his own party, the rightwing nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home).Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Brokered agreement will only work if factories step up on base price, says IFA presidentDoctors could face investigation if found over prescribing benzodiazepines and other similar drugsParamilitary-style attack on Quinn executive Kevin Lunney \u0026lsquosevere beyond comprehension\u0026rsquoImporters and exporters urged to \u0026lsquoget organised\u0026rsquo to deal with flood of new paperworkOwen Keegan calls on councillors to reverse stance due to pressure on Dublin\u0026rsquos financesPainters to lose railings pitches next summer to facilitate Uefa festivalSpecial arrangements leaving North within UK may be acceptable, says Arlene FosterMood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic despite boisterous claims by the British PMDenise McManus had to leave her apartment in what ultimately became an \u0026lsquoawful process\u0026rsquoInappropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines having corrosive effect on patientsFormer British soldier is accused of murdering two men during 1972 shootingExperts agree that accurate information among best ways to make policy decisionsTaoiseach says parents without card can \u0026lsquogo through the rigmarole\u0026rsquo of filling in formsChildcare needs more common in countries with \u0026lsquoless generous welfare states\u0026rsquo, says ESRIResearch claims trials between 2014 and 2016 raises \u0026lsquoserious concerns about low standards\u0026rsquoVictim is named as Brendan Kilduff (60s) who had stopped on way home from beef protest\u0026lsquoWhat we want to see is a recognition that we are on an island... but also we are in the UK\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoLong overdue review of the Defamation Act\u0026rsquo is needed, Oireachtas committee hears\u0026lsquoI enjoyed my whole life.

File Photograph: PAThe Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) has called on meat processors to come forward with a “strong base price” for farmers as factories slowly start to reopen.IFA president Joe Healy said the issue of a base price could not be discussed at talks last weekend to resolve the long running dispute over payments made to farmers at the factory gate.He blamed Ireland’s “flawed competition law” though base price is still the most important issue for beef farmers.Farmers outside the Anglo Beef Processors (ABP) plant in Ferrybank, Co Waterford called off their protest on Wednesday night. It follows a decision by farmers outside the Dawn Meats factory in Slane who ended their protest on Wednesday afternoon. The fate of the other 20 plants which have been blockaded is so far unclear.The seven week dispute is as a result of farmers frustration over the price they are being paid at the factory gate for their cattle which they state is under the cost of production, and they are therefore losing money.Mr Healy said the issue of base price had been raised in the talks last weekend though competition law prevents price fixing.Nevertheless, he stressed that “the success of the agreement, on the ground, would very much depended on the factories approach on the base price.“I would now urge the factories to re-open and to come forward with a strong base price. This would help to start the process of building some sort of trust and to get the industry up and running.”FearHe said there were real fears among farmers that the meat factories would seek to claw back some of the financial concessions they have made in relation to bonus payments following the agreement brokered by the Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed last weekend.“The potential for factories to undermine these by manipulating the base price was an obvious concern,” Mr Healy warned.“I would now urge the factories to re-open and to come forward with a strong base price. This would help to start the process of building some sort of trust and to get the industry up and running.”Mr Healy said the new beef price index will be available from this week and will go some way to providing more transparency on cattle prices in the weeks ahead.Angus Beef Ireland, which represents 7,000 members, says its members are suffering financially as a result of the blockade.Angus farmers would typically send 1,000 cattle each week to Irish and EU customers, but are prevented from selling their factory-ready animals due to the blockades.Angus Beef Ireland managing director Gerry Smyth said: “Our members are struggling to make ends meet at present. Their cattle are going over weight and fat, and moving out of specification, which means they will lose the bonuses that are typically paid for these high-quality animals.“These protests have gone too far, hard won customers for Angus beef may look to other markets if they can’t buy in Ireland, which would do long-term damage to our members.“No one is denying that times are tough for beef farmers, but these ongoing protests are damaging to everyone. It’s time to find a solution and allow time for the deal agreed over the weekend to try to work.”"},{"url":null,"title":"merrion square artists sidelined for football fans","story":"More than 100 artists who sell their work at Merrion Square each weekend will be banned from their traditional pitches next summer to accommodate Uefa Euro 2020 events.The artists who pay €240 for annual casual trading licences from Dublin City Council for pitches along the railings outside the square have been told trading will be suspended for six weeks next June and July when the square will be turned into a “festival village” for football fans.Four football matches will be held in the Aviva Stadium next summer, but the artists have been told the square will be required from early June to mid-July. The festival village will involve live match screenings, football activities and competitions, food and drink, music and entertainment as well as “artistic and cultural performances”. However the regular artists, some of whom have been trading on the square for more than 35 years have been excluded.Summer trading“This will involve a complete loss of livelihood for six weeks of the summer months, which is the busiest time of the year. We are outdoors in all weathers winter and summer but hours of trading are restricted by light so June and July days are also our longest.”Many of the 101 artists who trade on the square are dependent on the weekend sales which are particularly popular with tourists and Dubliners during the summer months.“This will be a catastrophic loss for many of the artists. Some have told me they will have to go on the dole for those six weeks.”Artists were informed of their exclusion from the square by letter attached to their annual licence renewal form and were given fewer than 10 days to respond, Ms Prendergast said. They have been offered a licence reduction of €60 by the council but have not been offered an alternative location, she said.‘Commercial branding’“The specific reason for the artists to vacate is to allow Dublin City Council to hang commercial branding on the exterior railings of the square, which is the location for which the artists hold their licence to exhibit.” However, she said it was unlikely the football festival would be compatible with the art sales.“The people who are going to these events won’t want to buy and the people who do want to buy won’t want to come in with these events on.”Labour city councillor Dermot Lacey said he would be calling on the council to make an alternative venue available to the artists.“I would be very supportive of the artists. I am always of the view that you can’t create new rights by displacing the rights of others. This is not acceptable and I will be fighting their case,” he said.“I don’t believe it is beyond the wit of the council to find an alternative exhibition space for the artists. Maybe at the railings of the National Art Gallery or the Natural History Museum.”The council said it is working to identify an alternative location for artists."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4023518.1568883250!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup signals possible compromise to facilitate brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster: party may accept a new Brexit deal which treats the North differently to the rest of the UK  subject to conditions. Photograph: Brian LawlessPADUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party could accept special arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit as long as they did not affect the North’s position in the UK.In a move that will raise hopes the DUP are ready to compromise to achieve a Brexit deal, Ms Foster said on Wednesday night there were solutions to the Brexit impasse that involved special treatment for Northern Ireland but did not affect the constitutional position of the North.However, she said such arrangements would have to be supported by politicians in the North.Her comments to journalists in Dublin suggest the DUP could possibly accept a new Brexit deal which treated the North differently to the rest of the UK, subject to conditions.Asked if Northern Ireland-specific solutions were possible if they did not affect the constitutional position of the North, Ms Foster said: “Well, I hope so, because what we want to see working . . . I think what we want to see is a recognition that we are on an island. We do recognise the unique history and geography, but we also have to recognise that we are in the United Kingdom.” Backstop roleMs Foster warned that the existing backstop – which could keep the North under EU rules to avoid a hard border – “is anti-democratic, unconstitutional and has to go . . . that is our position”.She said the backstop in the present agreement “would bring about customs between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that is unconstitutional and undemocratic”.However, her message in Dublin – that the DUP could accept different treatment to the rest of the UK for the North in a future new Brexit deal – will likely be seen as indicative of the DUP’s willingness to move in negotiations on a new Brexit deal.She insisted that the DUP was not “a no-deal party”.‘Single market’The DUP leader was in Dublin to address the Dublin Chamber of Commerce annual dinner. In her speech, she said solutions could be found which did not damage the integrity of the single market, but also did not “erect new barriers to trade within the UK”.Afterward, she met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for 45 minutes at Government Buildings where discussions centred on Brexit. Earlier, the Taoiseach told the Dáil the Government would seek to have a “consultative role” in the government of Northern Ireland if the British government imposed direct rule after a no-deal Brexit.The Taoiseach reiterated the Government’s opposition to the introduction of direct rule after Brexit, which is widely expected. But he also told the Dáil the Government would use the provisions of the Belfast Agreement to seek a role in Northern Ireland in such a situation.“However, if the sovereign British government were to impose it, we would seek a consultative role under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: GettyOn Friday it will be 30 days since German chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson during a Berlin news conference that a solution to the Brexit impasse could maybe be found within 30 days.Johnson, seizing on her remarks, welcomed the “blistering timetable” and declared “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) a “Yes we can!” type phrase previously used by Merkel about the refugee crisis.And off he went. On that swing through European capitals, Johnson seemed to impress Merkel and later French president Emmanuel Macron with his desire to agree a new deal with the EU. Last week, he did the same with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.But what Merkel and Macron, Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker (don’t mention Xavier Bettel) and every other EU leader to whom he has spoken have said to Johnson is that those proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty.But 29 days on, there has been no sign of British proposals which do anything of the sort. As EU leaders note with increasing irritation, nothing concrete has been tabled by the British government which could serve as a basis for negotiations with the EU.Neither have the British tabled workable solutions in the technical discussions that continue between Downing Street officials and the European Commission – meetings that Johnson now wants to intensify so that they take place every day. While Brussels sources wonder for what? A series of British ministers – most recently new Northern Secretary Julian Smith – have floated various ideas to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, as reported in Wednesday’s .But several senior Irish sources are clear as a whistle on these ideas and concepts: none of them go remotely far enough towards establishing a workable alternative to the backstop. In other words, not alone are there no negotiations on a new deal going on, we are quite a distance away from the starting point for such negotiations. Speculation as to whether Johnson is serious about wanting a deal comes and goes in Dublin and in Brussels. Some politicians and officials expect British proposals to replace the backstop to be tabled late in the day, with a frantic period of negotiating against the deadline of a no-deal Brexit looming. Others say this is all just part of a strategy to avoid the blame for no deal. What, if anything, is taking shape? Johnson has claimed the shape of a deal is becoming clearer. And despite protestations it appears that if there is to be a deal it will be a Northern Ireland-specific solution that involves treating the North differently from the rest of the UK, in some respects. There may be a role for Stormont to give it democratic legitimacy in Northern Ireland. It will include an all-Ireland food and agriculture zone (eliminating the requirement for animals to be checked on the Border) and a series of measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, checks on goods at a business level and other arrangements designed to reduce cross-Border friction.However, senior Irish sources familiar with Government deliberations say that even if the details of these measures were worked out – and they are not – they would be insufficient to replace the backstop.That is because the position of Theresa May’s government – that it would eliminate the need for a border – has been junked by Johnson and replaced with a commitment to try to make the Border as frictionless as possible. That is a very big difference. And it will make a deal very difficult to reach. The mood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Questions have similarly been raised about whether he was wrongfully convicted.Sir Geoffrey remained defiant as he was questioned about the court case on Tuesday morning, claiming it had spurred him towards voting Brexit in 2016. Questioned about his suitability for a knighthood on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme, he told presenter Martha Kearney: “25 years ago, love, in a French court.”He added: It\u0027s a court case in France where you\u0027re guilty, which is one reason I don\u0027t vote to remain in the EU. You\u0027re guilty until you\u0027re proved innocent. That\u0027s totally the opposite from England and it\u0027s very difficult to prove you\u0027re innocent in another country, another language. Most people in England don\u0027t believe it.

In reality, it offers one new feature that’s radically different and others that reveal how useful they are the more you get to know them.Apple announced its new smart timepiece, called Apple Watch Series 5, alongside the new iPhone 11 in Cupertino, California. It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow\u0026nbspentirely different.The design itself hasn’t changed from last year. That’s no surprise because 2018’s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.The Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.First, there’s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

said its analysis shows nearly one in 10 (9 per cent) free cashpoints across the country had closed or switched to fee-paying during a 17-month period after changes to how the network is funded were set out.\u0026nbspThe consumer group used data from ATM network Link to make the findings.\u0026nbspReductions to the fees card issuers pay to ATM operators have sparked fears that cash deserts could be created, with bank branches also closing.\u0026nbspPress Association\u0027Helpful news for consumers\u0027\u0026nbspConsumer price\u0026nbsprises slowed down from an annual rate of 2.1 per cent in July to 1.7 per cent in August.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s good for UK households, says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.\u0026nbspAugust’s moderation in inflation to 1.7 per cent\u0026nbspadds to the improvement in consumer purchasing power coming from annual earnings growth rising to an 11-year high of 4 per cent\u0026nbspin the three months to July.\u0026nbspImproved consumer purchasing power is particularly welcome news for an economy currently struggling markedly amid major Brexit, domestic political and global economic uncertainties – consumers have been the most resilient sector of the economy and their purchasing power will be critical to whether this resilience can continue.UK inflation slows in temporary respite for consumers\u0026nbspInflation in Britain fell to 1.7 per cent last month - the slowest pace of price growth since December 2016 - after a surprisingly high rate of 2.1 per cent in July, writes The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova.Economists had expected inflation to slow to 1.9 per cent in August.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the largest pressure on inflation came from a drop in the prices of clothing and shoes and much slower inflation in recreational and cultural goods and services, which include toys and computer games, as well as in sea fares.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story:\u0026nbspUK inflation slows in temporary respite for consumers\u0026nbspSo what is more expensive, and what is cheaper?\u0026nbspRecreation and culture saw the biggest fall in price over the year to August. Within that grouping, games, toys and hobbies fell 5 per cent between July and August 2019.\u0026nbspAir fares rose by more in 2019 than in 2018 but sea fares rose by less.\u0026nbspA number of essential costs have also risen in price, including\u0026nbspthe cost of owning a home, energy bills, and council tax.\u0026nbspClothes and shoes rose in price by 1.8 per cent.Cash-starved Air India putting crews on low-fat diet\u0026nbspNEW DELHI (AP) Cash-starved Air India is putting its crew on a diet, changing their inflight menu to special low-fat meals.\u0026nbspDhananjay Kumar, the state-run airline\u0027s spokesman, said Wednesday that the objective is to provide healthy and cost-effective meals to crews on domestic and international flights.\u0026nbspKumar declined comment on media reports that the cost per meal, mostly vegetarian, will come down to one-third of existing 500-800 rupees (up to $11) per meal.\u0026nbspThe new menu was introduced Monday on flights originating from New Delhi and Mumbai and will be extended to other routes soon.\u0026nbspAssociated PressThe chancellor is, unsurprisingly, upbeat about the the latest inflation figures.\u0026nbspSajid Javid, said: “Low inflation and high wage growth means people\u0027s hard-earned cash is going further, helping them to provide for their families.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re helping with the cost of living by cutting taxes for more than 30 million people and ensuring that almost a million of our dedicated public sector workers - including our soldiers, teachers and doctors - get above-inflation pay increases.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was well above the 75 per cent approval required.The proposal had met with staunch opposition from Lady Nadine Cobham, whose late husband Michael ran the business.She had called for the government to step in and on Wednesday welcomed the move by Ms Leadsom: “I’m delighted that the government has listened to the widespread concerns about this takeover offer and the risk it poses to high-tech jobs and our national security.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The Welsh government would not reveal the details of any support given.Any public funds pledged to support Mr Ratcliffe’s business interests are likely to raise eyebrows. In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They helped researchers confirm what kind of object the mysterious rock was – and that it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.The images show the clear tail streaming out the back of the comet, which is what identifies it as such. The tail is the result of outgassing, caused by material being spewed out the back of the object and propelling it through the universe.It is the first time any visitor to our solar system has shown such a behaviour. The only other known interstellar tourist was the object known as \u0027Oumuamua, which did not show any tail – a fact that continues to perplex astronomers to this day.The picture was nearly missed, researchers said, but was the result of astronomers rushing to take the picture soon after the msterious object was identified.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

The photo was taken soon after it was first seen, on the night of 9-10 September, by a telescope on\u0026nbspHawaii\u0027s\u0026nbspMaunakea.To take the images, researchers took observations in two different colour bands or filters and combined them into a colour image.For now, it is difficult for researchers to see more of the comet, because it has moved near to the Sun and is therefore difficult to see. But it is expected to swing into a better position in the coming months, as it continues its mysterious journey around the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t even know how to do a – I’ve never been on a stripper pole like that in my life.”Barbash said she wishes Cardi B (who has several cameos in the movie) had portrayed her instead of Lopez.She made similar comments in an interview with\u0026nbspVanity Fair, telling the magazine she “wasn’t really that impressed” with the film – though she did praise Lopez’s work on that occasion.“I was impressed with Jennifer,” she said, “She was incredible.

In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

David Phelan has been testing the iPhone 11 for the\u0026nbsplast weekThree iPhones go on sale in a matter of days, promising improved photography, tweaked design, faster speed and something which may mean more than all of those to many: improved battery life.The new phones are the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, replacing the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max respectively.There’s a new naming system, then. Last year, it was the iPhone XS that was the standard iPhone, with the XR seen as a cut-price alternative. Now, the successor to the XR is the definitive iPhone, simply called iPhone 11, with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max being presented as upscale versions. It’s a subtle repositioning.All of which is fine, if the iPhone itself earns its consideration as the mainstream phone.The iPhone 11 is a direct successor to the iPhone XR in design terms. From the front, it looks identical to last year’s models, with a 6.1-inch LCD screen that goes to the edges all the way around. This is a significant achievement in itself – most LCD screens require wide bezels at top and bottom at least. Apple found a way to reach the edges with what it calls a Liquid Retina display on last year’s iPhone XR and it’s the same here. The screen looks great, though at 326 pixels per inch, it’s much less detailed than the Pro models. Sometimes text can look a little less sharp than you’d like but Apple’s new software design, such as the gleaming wallpapers, for instance, emphasise the strengths of the LCD so well, so it’s rarely an issue.The newness in the design becomes apparent when you turn the iPhone 11 so you can see the sides. The XR was available in multiple colourful finishes and that’s the same here. This is visible from the edge because the aluminium antenna band which wraps around the phone is colour-matched to what’s on the rear of the phone.The colours this time are all new. Four of the six are gently updated from last year’s black, white, yellow and red, all of which are slightly different from the iPhone XR. The other two are completely new: a green that has a minty vibrancy and a striking purple. It’s nothing like purple, in my book, but is a mouth-wateringly appealing lavender shade that looks great. It’s the standout among this year’s colours, I’d say.The other changes to the design are on the back of the phone. First, the colours shine out brilliantly, with a polished-glass finish. Gloss all over apart from the camera bump which has a matte finish.How Apple’s new iPhones compare to the competitionThe camera bump had leaked in advance, or so we thought. But it turns out it’s very different from what was expected. The general belief was that it would be a deep, solid black bump with three flush cameras in, like the iPhone XS.In fact, the lenses protrude, so the bump is much less dominant than expected and the area around the lenses is coloured to match the rest of the back of the phone, not black as on earlier multi-camera phones. These two design choices make the camera area look significantly better.By the way, yes, multi-camera. Unlike the iPhone XR, with its single snapper, there are two lenses here – of which, more later. That’s the other big change to the look of the back of the phone, though there’s one more noticeable difference.On iPhones up until now, the back has always featured the Apple logo, the word iPhone and the words “Designed in California” and “Assembled in China”. In some “S” years, that letter would be there, too. There was also the CE mark and a do not recycle graphic.Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, USA, 10 September 2019 (EPAJOHN G. MABANGLO)Apart from the Apple logo itself, everything else has now gone. The logo has moved down the back to a more central position. As a result, it looks much cleaner, more elegant.In the hand, the iPhone 11 feels great. Despite its large display, it’s comfortable even in smaller hands and the smooth edges mean you can roll it through your fingers satisfyingly.The detailing is remarkable, as you would expect from Apple. The volume buttons, power button, mute switch and even the inside of the Lightning charging socket are perfectly colour-matched to the rest of the phone.The cameras here are both 12MP sensors, one wide and one ultra-wide. The iPhone 11 is significantly cheaper, £270 less than the iPhone 11 Pro, with pricing starting at £729. Last year’s iPhone XR, by the way, is still available and has dropped in price to £699.Despite the price difference there is a lot the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro share and that includes the cameras. These are identical to two of the iPhone 11 Pro’s three cameras – the Pro also has a telephoto lens.Two lenses mean that portrait mode with its sharp-focus-subject-blurred-background effect is now here with a vengeance. It was possible on the iPhone XR through software but that meant objects and, more importantly, pets didn’t register. It needed a pair of human eyes to work. Now, portrait mode works for everything. There’s also a high-contrast black-and-white mode that’s especially eye-catching.A new camera interface means the phone shows you what the wide lens sees and around the edges to fill the display with what the ultra-wide would see, if you were using that. If you decide it’s a better shot, you can switch to it. It’s a useful system and my only disappointment is that when you do flick to the ultra-wide, it no longer occupies the whole screen. However, that wouldn’t show everything the camera can see, so it’s unavoidable.Edelson  AFP)JOSH EDELSONAFPGetty Images)There’s also a new night mode which activates automatically when light is low. You can turn it off, but the results are mostly outstanding, so it’s worth letting the iPhone do its stuff. It takes multiple shots and puts them together to create an improved result. The shots are taken over a second, sometimes longer and a slider counts it down for you.The images are realistic, not impossibly bright and still catch the feeling of the moment. On a couple of occasions I found the colours were a little different from what my eyes saw but this was the exceptional, not the commonplace, result.The camera interface is also improved with a swipe mechanic on the screen to reveal extra menu options.The front-facing camera is now 12MP, too and comes with a wider field of view. When you turn the iPhone to landscape orientation, the camera knows to automatically choose that wider view. Apple also announced the slofie (I know, I know) which stands for slow-motion selfie video shot at 120 frames per second. These are actually quite fun.All these features are on the Pro phones, too, but for many, the iPhone 11 camera will be more than good enough.This is a major upgrade on all the new iPhones. The iPhone XR already had the best battery life of any iPhone and this one adds an extra hour to that. It’s hard to pin down exactly how many hours that really means, but in my testing, it has lasted from early to late every single day. This is a super-refreshing change. I’d still recommend nightly charges for peace of mind, but this is a big step forward. Anyone nursing an iPhone 7, say, whose battery may be needing a little boost during the day, will enjoy what the iPhone 11 has to offer.The release of iOS 13 on Thursday 19 September brings more features. There’s the dark mode which has proved highly popular, offering a less in-your-face design with black backgrounds instead of white. On the Pro phones with their OLED screens that will offer power saving, but not with LCD. Here it’s a clean, attractive look.Face ID, the fast, reliable and secure facial recognition system introduced on the iPhone X, is more effective now and works at more angles, so you don’t have to crane your neck forward when it’s on your desk, say – though you do still have to lean in. This improvement will also happen on the other Face ID iPhone models as it’s software-based.iPhones on 10 September, 2019, and slashed prices of older models (Apple)The processor, called A13 Bionic, is blisteringly fast. Right now, it’s easy to notice how quickly apps launch and respond when in use but as developers create more demanding apps, expect the new processor to step up to the plate.Note that the splendid 3D Touch effect of the iPhone X and XS is not here. That’s the subtle haptic feedback you get when you touch certain menus. It was replaced on the iPhone XR by Haptic Touch which works in a different way. Previously, Haptic Touch was limited in what it did but it’s now been expanded to wherever 3D Touch went. Haptic Touch is now on the Pro iPhones, too. You can feel a difference and it doesn’t feel quite as nippy as 3D Touch, but on the whole, I forgot about the change pretty much instantaneously.The new design is a gentle update, but the new iPhone is still a triumph thanks to its snazzy colours, great feel and super-fast performance. Though the display isn’t a match for the Pro models it’s still fine and works well. The considerably extended battery life will be enough to justify an upgrade for many, and the extra upgrades such as the truly excellent cameras may seal the deal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects.

It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.A BBC statement at the time defended Humphrys and said: “Viewers and listeners expect BBC interviews with politicians to be fair but also robust and testing. Day in and day out John Humphrys and his colleagues on the Today programme demonstrate with great professionalism how it is possible to achieve both those objectives.“We invariably take great care to investigate complaints from any party and we also have to be alert to the kind of pressures which in the past have tended to increase as a general election gets nearer.”BBC director general Tony Hall said that public figures would breathe “a sigh of relief” at Humphrys’ departure, in a piece for The .Describing him as “a journalistic great”, the director general wrote: “He is driven by a profound sense of justice and a deep distrust of authority. It means that he has always, unerringly, represented the listener and championed their right to know.”“There is perhaps no greater tribute than the collective sigh of relief issued by leaders and public figures all over the country,” he added.\u0026nbspAppearing on the Thought for the Day segment, rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks paid tribute to Humphrys, commenting: “We don’t have prophets nowadays but if we did, one place you’d probably find them would be the\u0026nbspToday\u0026nbspprogramme.“Today’s tough interviewers are recognisably in that tradition of holding power accountable to truth... John Humphrys has been one of the best of our time. What’s made\u0026nbspJohn distinctive has been his fearless moral passion, and his refusal to be fobbed off with evasions and equivocations. He’s been called ‘radio’s rottweiler’ and the BBC’s ‘scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier’, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.”“He’s been called the listener’s champion because he asked the questions we’d like to ask but don’t get the chance to. To do that for 32 years without loss of energy or integrity is quite something.”John Humphrys isn’t politically correct – but that’s why I like himJohn Humphrys criticised for questioning Rupert Everett on sexualityJohn Humphrys attacks ‘nasty person’ who leaked BBC joke audioIn a tribute in the\u0026nbspRadio Times, Justin Webb wrote: “There are plenty who don’t like him, who think he’s gone on too long, who want him ‘pensioned off’ or ‘put out of his misery’ or whatever the phrase is they use to suggest that being a man in his\u0026nbsp70s\u0026nbspon air is somehow an affront.“Most of these folks would see themselves as impeccable anti-sexists and anti-racists, but ageism is alive and well and apparently deeply acceptable in the anti-John movement.”Today editor Sarah Sands revealed that\u0026nbspMr Cameron joked\u0026nbsphe was coming on Thursday’s programme “to make sure he got the old bugger out of the building”.“He doesn’t let go,” Sands said of Humphrys on Radio 4’s The Media Show. “He’s a terrier, so I think you should expect something exciting.”The Today programme will continue with four main presenters – Justin Webb, Mishal Husain, Martha Kearney and Nick Robinson – rather than directly replacing Humphrys, who will continue to present Mastermind on BBC TwoThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is also a clear political vibe, with commentary on Brexit, the NHS, mental health and how we communicate with each other all strong themes on many of the shortlisted entries.\u0026nbspThe shortlist follows a shake-up of the judging panel, which added Stormzy, Gaz Coombes, Annie Mac and Jorja Smith, and critic and Vice editor Tshepo Mokoena to the group of experts who will decide the winner at a ceremony later this year.See the full shortlist for this year’s Mercury Prize:Idles – Joy As An Act of Resistance\u0026nbspThe 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsFoals have been shortlisted for the third time, having previously appeared on 2013’s list with Holy Fire (losing out to James Blake – Overgrown) and 2010 with Total Life Forever, when the prize was won by The xx for their self-titled debut.\u0026nbspReviewing part one of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost (the second half is being released this autumn), Mark Beaumont gave the album five stars and wrote: “It’s a dystopian vision becoming all the more real with every February heatwave, and Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 is a fitting vehicle.\u0026nbsp“Merging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.There’s a strong showing for both UK rap and also an apparent surge in guitar music, with the majority of shortlisted acts making prominent use of the instrument, including Little Simz on her album GREY Area.\u0026nbspSimz and Dave’s albums were also awarded five stars apiece from The Independent. Of Psychodrama, The Independent commented: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.\u0026nbsp“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”This year’s “token jazz album”, as it has become known, is the 10-piece SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass, which combines South African jazz with Sixties soul and hip hop influences. The project is helmed by composer Cassie Kinoshi, who also plays alto sax in the jazz septet Nérija and in Afrobeat band Kokoroko. Driftglass’s title is taken from writer Samuel R Delany’s image of glass fragments washed by tides, which Kinoshi adopted for the album as a metaphor for how the tides of improvisation form compositions.Notable omissions include James Blake\u0027s Assume Form\u0026nbspalong with albums by Florence + the Machine, AJ Tracey, Lucy Rose and previous winner Skepta. As per previous years, metal is ignored by the prize and so critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums by artists including Bring Me the Horizon, Black Peaks, Architects and Employed to Serve have been left off this year\u0027s list.\u0026nbspFoals interview: ‘Brexit feels like an act of self-harm’Little Simz interview: ‘If you get offended by me, that’s on you’Dave jokes he can ‘retire now’ following Thiago Silva shout-outGeoff Taylor, Chief Executive of BPI - home to the Hyundai Mercury Prize, said: “These 12 albums are essential listening!

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates and the film’s central trio embody an impossible movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to miss as soon as they appear on screen.We know. Where you stand on Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture questions we’ve all asked ourselves in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will. Annie Hall, admittedly, is a masterpiece, if you can look past the obvious.While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent book shop, but find love when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre.Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as clichés: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the ChristmasNew Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jewish man”“Shiksa goddess woman” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex, never bettered than in the film’s iconic diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only clichéd because When Harry Met Sally set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.Pretty Woman certainly isn’t good, with an undercurrent of sleaze so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn it was once planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. But Julia Roberts is pure star-is-born loveliness here, beloved by the camera and endlessly watchable as a result, her joyous pluck overshadowing the rest of the film’s murkier elements. That Disney, the studio behind the film, imagined its aspirational romcom hero as a rich businessman prowling Hollywood Boulevard for an escort is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow pulls it off… even more so.There are a few moments in this high-school re-telling of George Bernard Shaw\u0027s Pygmalion – in which, due to an elaborate bet, popular jock Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr) attempts to turn artsy nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the Prom Queen in six weeks – that pull the rug out from under your feet. One such moment is when Laney finds out about Zach’s ploy. “Am I a bet? Am I a bet? Am I a f**king bet?” It is raw, painful, and elevates the film well above your average high-school romcom.Saving Face is both a romantic comedy about gay women, and a romantic comedy about two Asian-Americans, making it a double rarity in the genre. But its loveliest quality is its Manhattan earthiness, with its smoky streets, subway cars, fire escapes and cheap take-out places, all backdrops to the tentative relationship between surgeon Michelle Krusiec and dancer Lynn Chen.Partly because she was its last high-profile “queen”, Katherine Heigl has often been positioned as the actor that killed the romantic comedy. Which is unfair for a host of reasons, but specifically because both Knocked Up and 27 Dresses are such pristine examples of how great the romcom can still be. 27 Dresses is the more traditional of the pair, Heigl surrounded by stock characters (including Judy Greer once again cast as the sad-sack best friend, as she did in the Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Wedding Planner) and playing a brunette and therefore unlucky-in-love single New Yorker obsessed with weddings. But she is such a delightfully prickly and neurotic presence that it makes up for the film’s lesser qualities. We truly didn’t appreciate her at the time.530 26. Playing by Heart (1998)Not strictly a romantic comedy, buoyed as it is by serious drama involving everything from infidelity to AIDS, Playing by Heart is one of those talky, interconnected, Robert Altman-esque indies that dominated so much of American cinema in the Nineties. But the reason it’s here is because two of its many storylines feature lighter pairings that appear unlikely on paper but somehow become incredibly compelling and tender in execution. In one, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe meet at an LA bar and begin a romance in another, Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart meet in a bookstore and begin dating. Both stories develop from there, with Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn and Madeleine Stowe among the recognisable faces orbiting them. But whatever the tone of each seemingly unrelated story, Playing by Heart is driven by a lovely, nostalgic sense of Los Angeles ennui at the end of the 20th century. No one has heard of this movie, and that’s a shame.Crazy Rich Asians may not have saved the romantic comedy last summer, as everyone predicted it would, but it remains a breathless celebration of the genre – with a far-too-late-in-the-day but still wholly appreciated ersity at its centre. Constance Wu is the New York economics professor who discovers her apparently Average Joe fiancee is in fact Singapore royalty. What follows is a fish-out-of-water comedy that both indulges in its gorgeous opulence while never becoming too in awe of it. Michelle Yeoh is a standout, as a high society matriarch intimidatingly protective of her son.Few romantic comedies are more nakedly aspirational about big-city jobs, capitalism and the social power of being busy than One Fine Day, a mid-Nineties comedy about two single parents thrust together when their hectic schedules mean their children miss the class trip. There are far too many big cellphones here, but Michelle Pfeiffer and an ER-era George Clooney, as the squabbling pair at its centre, must surely rank as one of the most beautiful romantic comedy couples in recent memory.The first black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as their white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a powerful, womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much sparkiness that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career.Released a decade after Knocked Up, Seth Rogen’s adorable if occasionally bro-heavy first stab at the romcom, Long Shot bears the fruits of a man who has fixed some of his more regressive tendencies in the interim, producing something smarter, more sensitive and as interested in the feelings, neuroses and dialogue of his female co-star as he is to himself. He is a left-wing journalist recruited as a speechwriter for his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), who is now the US Secretary of State, and the pair forge an unshakable bond despite their wildly juxtaposed looks and vocations in life. Against the odds, Theron and Rogen are adorable together, while the film strikes a wonderful balance between sweetness and crudity. Long Shot may have flopped at the box office, but it’s the closest thing we’ve had to a romcom classic in years.A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet-set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a bit like peering into a time capsule a reminder of a time when Russell Brand was (nearly) a Hollywood A-lister, and people believed Jason Segel could be a movie star. Of the post-Judd Apatow era of romantic comedies, this remains the best, however – nicely balancing genuine sweetness and pathos (Mila Kunis is at the peak of her adorability as Segel’s love interest) with A-grade smut (Segel’s two full-frontal nude scenes remain hilariously shocking no matter how often you’ve seen them). There’s also a puppet musical thrown in for good measure, which is never not welcome.Very loudly not fun but still something quietly extraordinary, The Break-Up is a romcom in reverse, with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn a couple at the end of their tether, who really shouldn’t be together and break up before the opening credits roll, and then muddle through the following 90 minutes figuring out what to do next. Aniston, always underrated as a movie star, is brilliantly magnetic, while Vaughn nicely downplays the manic energy that tends to suffocate his on-screen partners in his other roles. The film’s closer, a thoughtful, heartfelt celebration of having once loved someone regardless of how it all ended, is one of the bravest things an expensive studio romcom has done in recent decades.This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul).1430 17. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in this wry, warm-hearted ointment. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this film marks the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott-Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot.As much a ludicrously beautiful romcom as it is a nostalgic snapshot of the New York hip-hop scene at the turn of the 21st century, Brown Sugar casts Taye Diggs as an A\u0026ampR executive for a record label and Sanaa Lathan, magnetised to so many black romcoms during this time, as the editor for XXL Magazine. Friends since childhood, they’re perfect for one another, but involved with other people (the similarly too-beautiful-for-words real-life couple Boris Kodjoe and Nicole Ari Parker). Queen Latifah and Mos Def are their perfectly cast best friends, just to add to the film’s early-Noughties charm.Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one stand-out set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold.The secret masterpiece of the teen movie boom birthed in 1999, and truthfully one of the last of that era, Get Over It grabs so many elements from its subgenre predecessors (a Shakespearean undercurrent, sexually excitable animals and cameos from one-hit-wonders of the time) that it’s a wonder it’s so brilliant. Ben Foster is the recently-dumped high school basketball player who signs up for the school play (a musical version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, naturally) to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Surrounding them are an array of recognisable faces, including Mila Kunis, Martin Short, Zoe Saldana and the literal Sisqo, while it features one of the finest Backstreet Boys-era boyband spoofs this side of Josie and the Pussycats.1830 13. 500 Days of Summer (2009)Beloved and loathed in equal measure, 500 Days of Summer is notorious among a certain generation of young people who grew up with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel as quirky hipster pin-ups. And it’s likewise already something of a nostalgic masterpiece, beloved in first-year university film studies classes if then loudly rejected come graduation. There’s a lot to say about where its allegiances lie (is Deschanel’s Summer the movie’s villain, or its rational, realistic hero?), but that discussion also swallows up appreciation for what is for the most part a clever and funny comedy, and a movie that sincerely celebrates the conventions of the genre.It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renee Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-Millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively, and a perfect Christmas finale. It’s truly one of the best of the genre.2030 11. 13 Going on 30 (2004)If every romantic comedy is a fantasy, then 13 Going on 30 is the ultimate fantasy romcom. As if she has watched too many herself, unhappy tween Jenna Rink wishes she could be 30, flirty and thriving, and wakes up one morning a high-powered magazine editor who looks like Jennifer Garner, and whose dorky neighbour has transformed into Mark Ruffalo. By turns incredibly touching and genuinely funny, 13 Going on 30 is brought to life by Garner, who plays the adult-bodied Jenna as a guileless spark plug of self-doubt, glee and determination. Also features none of the weird child molesting undertones of Big, which we should forever be thankful for.With Nora Ephron having slipped off this mortal coil, Nancy Meyers has more or less claimed her spot as Hollywood’s most dependable creator of sensitive and funny love stories set within designer kitchens. She has a largely great filmography, but Something’s Gotta Give remains her masterpiece. Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, both twinkling with lived-in Seventies-movie-star ease, play variations on their off-screen personas: her the exasperated neurotic, him the womanising letch. They’re thrown together in the Hamptons, stumble upon an unexpected attraction, and wrestle with what it all means. Keanu Reeves, as Keaton’s doctor and secondary love interest, is additionally a dream.There’s a great Arrested Development storyline in which Jason Bateman’s character doesn’t realise his love interest is mentally ill because she’s an eccentric British woman who looks like Charlize Theron. It may or may not have been inspired by Serendipity, the greatest romantic comedy ever made about a deranged and beautiful Englishwoman fixated on fate, chance and the cosmos. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack meet by chance at Christmastime in New York, share a blissful evening together but then go their separate ways, Beckinsale sure that they must only date if the universe doesn’t otherwise intervene. Some time later, the pair are engaged to other people, but can’t shake their memories of that fateful Christmas Eve. Sweet, cosy and completely irresistible, Serendipity is a rare Christmas movieromantic comedy twofer and features two lovely performances at its centre. Absolutely bonkers, to be fair, but few films on this list aren’t.2330 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most convincingly heartwarming comedies of the last 20 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you never to turn away.Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendor than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, with two lonely souls both left dispirited by the holiday season yet finding each other hopelessly up in one another’s lives. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley Maclaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season.Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to re-discover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties-romcom sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best.You could argue that June and Joseph – the dead, park bench couple – have the most poignant love story in this film, but the one between world-famous movie star Anna (Julia Roberts) and very-much-not-famous bookshop owner Will (Hugh Grant at perhaps his most charming, foppish and floppy-haired) comes a close second.A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-haughtier Katharine Hepburn as a feisty heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiancé (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her.

Now I’m unable to support them or myself.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the five-week wait fatally undermines this principle, pushing people into debt, homelessness and destitution.“In a society that believes in justice and compassion, this isn’t right. But it is something that can be fixed. Universal credit was designed to have a wait. Now it’s clear that wait is five weeks too long, and we must change that design.”Margaret Greenwood MP, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said the “shocking” figures showed that universal credit was forcing people to turn to food banks to survive, despite ministers’ “repeated” efforts to “explain away” any link.“It is completely wrong for people to be left waiting five weeks or more for a first payment. Advances are not the answer they are loans that have to be paid back, pushing people further into debt and leaving them vulnerable to scams,” she added.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

So I had conversations with private secretaries and the like but I never asked for anything improper to be said or done.Pressed on why he had involved the Queen in politics, Mr Cameron said: I never asked for anything improper. I don\u0027t want to say anything more about this, I\u0027m sure some people would think, possibly even me, that I\u0027ve already said a bit too much.The former Tory leader said he had made a terrible mistake when he was overheard saying the Queen had purred down the phone when he informed her Scottish voters had decided to remain in the UK.The row emerged in a new BBC documentary about Mr Cameron\u0027s time in power, where he revealed he had been staying at Balmoral, when a newspaper poll came out putting the Yes campaign ahead for the first time, which he compared to a “blow to the solar plexus”.He said: “I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen’s private secretary and I had with the Queen’s private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even you know, a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc bias mash report kumar","story":"Butyou can’t even do that then you’re probably Nish Kumar and there’s no real need to worry.For as long as the BBC remains a going concern you’ll be hosting The Mash Report, which has been doing Auntie’s dirty political work for four series now without any change to the agenda, format or personnel.So we still get satirical news headlines presented by Ellie Taylor, the only team member with breakout potential.Offence finder general Rachel Parris continues to do a very convincing impression of a passive-aggressive public school nightmare.And there’s a guest slot for Geoff Norcott who, alone among the irregulars, treats it as a comedy show.Uniquely, Geoff is also the only person introduced by his political preferences: “The voice of Conservative Britain.”A tactic that, much like the host’s repeated references to, “BBC checks and balances”, is meant to give The Mash Report an air of neutrality but does the exact opposite, as none of the other guests are introduced as “left-wing student arse”, even though it describes all of them.Same applies, obviously, for host Nish, who has any number of unattractive presenting habits, the absolute worst of which is introducing the subject of race where no one  would think it belongs, including a picture of Boris’s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, with new puppy Dilyn.“People will lose their s**t over a nice white lady and a cute dog.”It hardly needs me to tell you the BBC would never allow a white presenter to go down the opposite road.Double standards and bias, though, are the calling cards of The Mash Report and its host, who’s one of those political obsessives who simply cannot cope with the fact the entire country doesn’t bend to his socialist will.So he’ll angrily denounce, “Sections of the Press” , for, “Failing to hold the Government to account”, while treating obvious anti-Boris anti-Brexit propaganda as absolute gospel.Here’s Nish’s version, for instance, on Jeremy Corbyn bottling out of a general election.“Labour don’t trust Boris Johnson enough to support a general election ’cos they fear he’ll set the date to force a No Deal Brexit and that lack of faith is totally justied.”I doubt even Jeremy Corbyn, in his cowardly heart of hearts, believes that cobblers. I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task.

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

over the summer.In the US, seven people are now reported to have died from vaping-related lung illnesses.India today announced that it was banning all e-cigarettes after the US deaths.The  today voted to adopt the prohibition, which applies to all flavoured e-cigarettes besides menthol, Cuomo’s office said in a statement.The state Department of Health pledged to provide retailers with a two-week grace period before conducting site visits to enforce the ban starting on October .New York is the second state in the nation to introduce such a ban, after Michigan did so earlier this month.Cuomo said: “It is undeniable that vaping companies are deliberately using flavors like bubblegum, Captain Crunch and cotton candy to get young people hooked on e-cigarettes - it’s a public health crisis and it ends today.Speaking on public radio on Monday, he said: We dont really know the health consequences of these devices.The number of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, according to preliminary federal data released last week.Their research found that . per cent of school kids reported using an e-cigarette in the past month.Last week, the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavoured e-cigarettes from store shelves.Nearly  people around the country have been stricken with a lung illness that is potentially vaping-related, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Investigators have said they are trying to understand what causes the illnesses.Michael Frennier, president of the New York State Vapour Association, criticised the New York ban.He said the recent spike in deadly lung illnesses was tied to illicit vaping of the marijuana component THC, not use of flavoured nicotine.Mr Frennier said: “It’s kind of like having a mayonnaise outbreak of E.coli and the politicians come forth and they say ‘We’re going to fix this to protect the people of our state and we’re going to ban peanut butter tomorrow morning.Meanwhile, health officials have warned people against buying vaping products on the street or using marijuana-derived oil.They have said people should avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some vaping products.New York state Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker is evaluating a proposal to extend the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes to cover menthol, which was excluded from the prohibition approved on Tuesday, Cuomo’s office said.In the UK, e-cigarettes are tightly regulated for safety and quality.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSJuul Labs Inc, the leading US e-cigarette maker, has insisted that it “never marketed to youth, period,” although the company has said it regretted that some of its early advertising “was executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.”On Tuesday, Juul Labs spokesman Ted Kwong said the company agreed with the need for “aggressive category-wide action on flavoured products,” adding that it “will fully comply with local laws.”Juul last year pulled many of its flavors from retail stores and suspended its social media accounts in an effort to curb use among teenagers."},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant mum lied baby real dad","story":"Louise Boyce, , pretended new lover Nathan Leggatt was the father and took him to register the birth.Leggatt even broke down in tears at the register office and told staff: Its a bit emotional to register the babys birth.Boyce had been embroiled in a bitter split with the babys real dad Ashley Sayce and acted out of spite when she lied on the form, a court heard.But she was rumbled when social services got involved and a paternity test proved he was the tots biological father.Boyce, who is pregnant again, has now been jailed for eight months after she admitted wilfully giving  information concerning registration of a birth.Her new lover was jailed for six months after admitting the same charge at Swansea Crown Court.The court was told new mum Boyce carried out the deception because she had a desire for Legatt to be the babys dad.Andrew Evans, defending Leggatt, said he had a genuine desire to play an active role in the babys welfare and wanted to be loyal to Boyce.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes after Michael Goveaposs we revealed the depth of her familyaposs feud with the Camerons after not seeing the former PM for more than three years. Journalist Sarah Vine shared how the Cameron and Gove children “grew up together in each other’s houses” and that the families holidayed together. But the friendship came to an end after Gove backed the UK leaving the EU.Vine spoke out after Cameron launched a scathing attack on Mr Gove in his memoirs, branding him a disloyal foam-flecked Faragist who twisted the truth when backing Brexit in the  referendum.   Speaking on LBC following Vineaposs piece in the Daily Mail, Cameron said heaposd like to try and have a friendship with the Gove Family. He added: “A lot of water has flowed under the bridge but it was very dficult at the time of the referendum.” Speaking to Nick Ferrari, Cameron said he and his we both thought the column was “incredibly sensitive and well written, and a rather emotional piece”. Vine, who is godmother to Florence Cameron, referenced her friendship with Samantha and reminisced of how they would share the school run. Cameron told LBC: We were very close and the children were friends and all the rest of it, I mean who knows, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge as I say.    A fall out between the families came at the start of  when Michael Gove decided to campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, and his party-comrade and close friend at the time, Cameron, was an insistent remainer. The two men have been distant since and Sarah Vine revealed she hadn’t seen ‘Dave’ since February  but that “by then it was already too late”. Cameron admits he feels that Michael Gove became “quite a dferent person” during the referendum but insists that “le moves on”.Michael Gove was Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary in Cameron’s newly formed cabinet after the  general election .In the interview Cameron acknowledged Goveaposs position in his cabinet and said he was a close member of his team who was central to supporting him.

A new BBC documentary last night revealed that the Queen’s unusual intervention ahead of the Scottish referendum came after a request from Mr Cameron. He suggested the monarch could ‘raise an eyebrow’ during the Scottish referendum campaign, at a time when the polls were narrowing in favour of the ‘Yes’ campaign.  He was staying at Balmoral, when a newspaper poll came out putting the Yes campaign ahead for the first time. Cameron described how it hit him “like a blow to the solar plexus” and led to a “mounting sense of panic that this could go the wrong way.”    The Queen made the surprise plea to Scots to ‘think very carefully’ about how they would vote, just a week before the September  referendum.  She told a member of the public: “I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.”  Mr Cameron wrote of this intervention: “I was delighted”. Scotland voted to remain in the UK by a % to % margin. A documentary about Mr Cameronaposs time in power also reveals that former chancellor George Osborne believed the Brexit referendum result was partly due to Mr Cameron stoking the idea that Brussels was to blame. Mr Osborne told the programme: We held a referendum we should never have held, and the consequences for the country are grave.    He attacked Mr Cameronaposs approach to the issue, saying: David Cameron was just one of a number of British prime ministers who had fed this idea that we were dferent than Europe, that Brussels was to blame and that the public ultimately had to have a say, and weaposve all paid a price for it in my view. I feel very sorry for what happened, and I feel responsible, I was the chancellor of the exchequer in that government, we held a referendum we should never have held, we then lost that referendum and the consequences for the country are grave, and the only thing I can plead in my mitigation is that a huge number of people wanted that referendum, and I made a case against it, but it wasnapost heard. Mr Cameron and the ex-chancellor also talked about their attempts to keep Michael Gove on their side in the referendum campaign. The ex-PM described the bombshell moment Mr Gove said he would support the Leave campaign.

Some  names, extremely popular back in the s, are now given to less than one tot a week, new research shows. Many of these names were shared by our loved TV stars in that decade, including characters from sitcom Friends and lestyle shows. Piers Morganaposs first name has plummeted from th in  to unranked now, meaning fewer than three babies shared the name in the last  months. And celebrity chef Ainsley Harriott has failed to cook up a storm with his name, as only five families chose it in the last year, compared to over  in . Official data from the Office of National Statistics shows hipster parents have also shunned the monikers Chandler, Ross and Monica - all favourites in the s largely as a result of Friends.    SJ Strum, a baby names expert for parenting site ChannelMum, said: Itaposs a lesson to modern parents that naming your child after the latest trend or popular TV show could see a swt decline in that name being one youaposll love forever. However, what goes down must come up. Highly unpopular baby names are often chosen by hipster parents as these mums and dads seek out a unique name which will make their child stand out in real le and increasingly online. While Sabrina the Teenage Witch has cursed that girlsapos name, the monikers Ada and Arthur now appeared to be popularised by the hit show Peaky Blinders. Among the most unpopular names for girls last year were Tammy, Justine and Tracy, with the names given to fewer than three babies each.    The rise of the terror group also saw the end of the name Isis. Not a single baby was given the name in , despite it being the th most popular name in the UK in . There were also only three named Norma, and four Carols. For boys, the least popular names are Jeff and Geoff, Melvyn, Greg and Graeme, with no babies given these monikers last year. Also unloved by mums and dads are Ken and Clive, with just three parents picking the names respectively for their children.  But the study also showed there is hope for some hated names, as nine in  parents are happy to consider a name which has fallen out of fashion in the hope of finding a hidden gem.

Although making a brew is a fairly routine task for most of us, the monarch has a legion of taxpayer-funded servants to carry out day-to-day chores. For this reason the workman said he was stunned when he realised what had happened. The story is recounted by royal upholsterer Kevin Andrews, who knew the builder, in Channel  documentary Secrets of the Royal Palaces. While dismantling a desk, The Sun reports , the workman was askedhe fancied a cup of tea.    He is said to have replied: “Yeah. In a mug. Two sugars. Builders’ tea. I don’t want any of that nonsense I had the last time I was here, all that fine china and all that saucer stuff.” A well-spoken woman came back and told him his beverage was on the table. He claims to have looked up and seen the Queen leaving the room.    A four-part series – Secrets Of The Royal Palaces – is due to be shown later this month on Channel  and the first episode focuses on Buckingham Palace. Dickie Arbiter, former press officer to the Queen, reportedly told the show there used to be a bar in the Palace but it was closed after some members of staff were too often worse for wear. They had to get rid, he claimed, according to the Daily Star. The show also reportedly reveals that upmarket bank Coutts, favoured by the royals, has installed an ATM at Buckingham Palace.

The group said it sent people - including convicted criminal leader Paul Golding - out to a beach near Dover on the lookout for desperate migrants who risk their lives to get to Britain from France. However a pro-migrant group called the move aposunsettlingapos, saying that people must respect British law when it comes to people landing on our shores. Britain First shared pictures of their patriot migrant patrol on its website, saying: Equipped with torches, binoculars and hi-vis jackets, our activists patrolled the beach keeping a close eye out for migrant crossings. It has been called Operation White Clfs by the group, who searched Samphire Hoe Beach near Dover last Saturday as hundreds of migrants have made it into the UK in recent weeks.    The group reportedly says it would alert police and the Coastguard to crossings. A spokesman for pro-migrant group, CareCalais, said: We are shocked and concerned to learn of this unsettling development on our Kent coastline. When deeply traumatised men, women and children arrive on our shores they are often in need of medical attention and should be met by professionals. We urge anyone who thinks otherwise to please think again.  Whatever your opinion regarding the arrival of people from France, we believe it is essential to maintain respect for British law and trust in the work carried out by our emergency response services. More than , migrants have crossed the Channel this year - more than the whole of . Last Tuesday a record  made it over in one day, and in August a total of  - also a record - crossed the Dover Strait, one of the worldaposs busiest shipping lanes. The perilous crossing has also seen two migrants - a man and a woman - die this summer. They are charged thousands by people smugglers, who send them over from Calais in small boats. Hundreds more are expected to make the crossing before the seasons change.  And many are anticipated to come from camps which have recently been shut down. An encampment holding , - including children - at a disused gym site in Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk, yesterday, while  asylum seekers were cleared from a site in Calais last week. On its page, Britain First writes about its patrols: This particular beach has been the main landing ground for multiple illegal migrant crossings. This new operation has been dubbed aposOperation White Clfsapos and will be escalated over the next few weeks. The group was mocked by a number of people on the page in a comments section.

It was the picture perfect moment as his proud daughter eagerly ran towards the classroom with her hair neatly plaited and her socks pulled up high. But tragically it was a bittersweet moment, because Laylaaposs mum Cheryl Hardy wasnapost there, after she died suddenly at their home in January . Ahead of the big day, devoted dad Fakir, known as aposZackapos, turned to YouTube so he could learn how to plait Layla’s hair to make sure everything was just right for her. Now Fakir, known as aposZackapos speaks for the first time to Mirror about how he is raising the five children they had together alone - with a little extra bit of help from YouTube. And he describes the heartbreaking moment that Layla asked him: aposWhen can mummy take me to school apos Another time, she worriedly asked: “You won’t leave us too, will you ”  Unable to answer the dficult questions, the grieving dad has instead tried to fill both roles of mother and father as best he can. Zack, , said: “Layla missed her presence every day. “But these are questions I cannot answer at the moment. “This might sound strange to some people, but I’ve not told any of my kids that their mum is not coming back. “I’ve never said it. At the moment, I don’t think the time is right given how young they are. “I don’t want them to get distracted and I’m waiting for the right time. “The time will come. Every time they mention mum, I just say she’s in a better place. “I don’t want them to get upset.”  The family had their hearts ripped out in January  as Cheryl, , passed away just seven weeks after giving birth to a baby boy. And as the last person to see her alive, Zack says he wishes he’d stayed with her after he woke up early and went downstairs. But he praises the support network of family, friends and neighbours who have helped anchor the family in their grief. Now he remains upbeat as he talks about how his family are continuing to thrive as they adapt to their new circumstances. Mum Cheryl, , was discovered unconscious by oldest daughter Rhiannah who immediately alerted Zack. But despite medics best efforts, she was declared dead  minutes after they arrived.  The circumstances were especially tragic as the mum, who hoped to become a midwe, had just given birth seven weeks earlier to a baby boy. And after Cheryl died, Zack pledged to raise the children they had together - Rhiannah, , Amirah, , Kameel, nine, Kesaar Mulla, seven, and Layla Mulla, five, - as a single dad. He said: “The biggest challenges are getting them what they need, rather than what they want. “And they go to three dferent schools so it’s all about handling that.” Before her death, Cheryl, who was training to be a midwe, had not been in good health following a trip to Disneyland Paris in December. And she had previously suffered a pulmonary embolism, which is when a clump of material like a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in the lungs.  But devastated Zack says the death “came out of the blue” and was completely unexpected. He said: “I couldn’t speak to anyone for about two weeks after it happened. “I refused to eat, speak to anyone properly, I just wanted to turn my phone off and disappear for about two or three weeks. “I was a mess. But at the same time, I knew I couldn’t give in because of the kids. “I knew that they only had me and I had to make sure I had a brave face on. “I was married to her for ten years, it’s dficult, I’m still brokenhearted.  He added: In the first few days after Cheryl died, I cried a lot. That upset my kids. They would beg me, apossmile, Daddy, smileapos. So I decided to try to hide my sadness. But my kids seemed to know that I was really sad and on the verge of tears. I told them that even though they couldnapost make my sadness go away, they could do something important by comforting me with all their hugs. I think their hugs have helped them as much as they have helped me. Now Zack says he is determined to make his we proud and keep her memory alive. He said: “We look through memory books with all the photos of our trip to Disneyland Paris. “They go through that a lot, which is good.”  And he says he sends her messages of gratitude constantly. He said: “I thank her, I thank her all the time. I’ll always pay tribute to her and mention her on social media. “I wouldn’t be here without her, she blessed me with the children. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re her kids and I’m doing everything in my le for her to make sure they’re looked after and loved all the time. “She’ll never be forgotten ever. I’ll mention her everyday around the house.” But the grieving dad admits he feels guilt over her death - even though it was due to medical issues. And he wakes up every day at half five, as that was the last time he spoke to her. He said: “I apologise to her when I wake up in the morning and I apologise to her when I go to bed. “I blame myself, I think it was my fault that I spoke to her at half past five in the morning and I didn’t stay in bed when I should have done. “Two hours later, she was found like that.”  Now Zack says he is not interested in another relationship as he focuses his attention on raising his children. Ahead of Layla joining Year One at primary school, Zack watched tutorials on the social media channel before practicing on his daughter’s doll. He said: “She’s been asking me for a while but I told her I couldn’t do it. “I can just about put two bobbles around her hair. “But I watched a few YouTube tutorials and tried it on a dolly. “It’s not a fantastic job but I’m doing what I can do. She was pleased.” Zack says Cherylaposs unexpected death sent shockwaves across the community as she was a keen volunteer.

The fast food giant is trialling a move to let diners swap the toy for a fruit bag instead. It comes as Burger King axes plastic toys from kidsapos meals - and will offer free meals to people whounwanted toys. And McDonaldaposs bosses are also planning to introduce paper-based toys next year. Explaining the move, Paul Pomroy, CEO of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said: We recognise that some people may not want a plastic Happy Meal toy, but we also know that the gts provide fun for many families and children. That’s why we’ll be running these trials, in order to give our customers a choice they also can choose not to have a toy or gt at all.    It’s important we understand what our customers want and we’ll learn a lot from whether they choose a fruit bag or a book over a toy. It is the latest in a series of moves aimed at reducing plastic consumption. These include using paper straws, withdrawing plastic lids from McFlurrys, and ending the use of single-use plastic in salads. Burger Kingaposs Meltdown campaign - which starts tomorrow - will see plastic toy amnesty bins placed in every restaurant across the UK. Burger King UK marketing director Katie Evans said: “It is impossible to ignore the growing problem excessive plastic waste is causing and we are glad to be taking action.    At Burger King we know we can positively contribute to finding new, more sustainable solutions, long term. “We’re inviting customers to donate their unwanted plastic toys and working with Pentatonic, we’re excited to give them a fresh start.

The mother, from Oklahoma, insisted it was a joke after the boy was taken away from her. A clip of the incident was circulated on Snapchat in which the child is seen drinking from what looks like a bottle of alcohol at their home in Payne County. The mum then takes the bottle from him and pours two capfuls of the liquid. Another child is then heard saying: Do it mom, do it.  The mum then feeds them to her son as the girl filming the video says: Thataposs my bro, thataposs my dude right there. Oh hell yeah.

It is alleged the boy, named only as Anton, was regularly beaten by his parents and he became overwhelmed. The youngster was found dead on the road last month in what police say was a suicide. His parents had shouted at him that day for damaging clothes, reports claim. Zhanna, a witness in Enerhodar, Ukraine, said: The parents yelled at the boy for ripping his clothes. I also heard them beating him. Then everything went quiet and I heard the child’s quick footsteps. Several seconds passed and there was that horric thud when a body hits the ground.    I looked out of my kitchen window and saw the boy lying below. I called an ambulance and the police. Another neighbour said: I saw the family going upstairs to their flat. Ten minutes later the boy was lying on the ground as his parents were racing downstairs in the street. Paramedics dashed to the scene but were unable to save Anton.    Police have now launched a criminal case on failure to fulfil parental duties against the victim’s parents. The suspects allegedly told them he jumped out of his room window right after the abuse. They also said they regularly beat up their son for misbehaving, according to reports.

Neil Parker, , from Queensland, Australia, was trekking alone on Sunday at Cabbage Tree Creek, near Brisbane when he fell  feet over the edge of the waterfall. The experienced hiker told the reporters from his hospital bed on Wednesday: I cartwheeled and slammed into the rock and landed in the creek at the bottom. He said he had to carry his leg after it clean snapped in half and the whole bottom of his limb came loose.    He also fractured his wrist during the fall. Neil damaged his phone in the waterfall and he decided to self-rescue and crawl to a clearing where he hoped he would be seen. He told of his agonising journey to the reporters: Iaposd get about a metre, a metre-and-a-half, each time before I had to stop and take a break. I just couldnapost believe it. Itaposs only kmbut it took two days to cover km. I was thinking that I was never going to get there.    His family launched a search operation with the help of Brisbane Bushwalkers community on Monday. A search-and-rescue helicopter spotted Neil and winched him to safety the next afternoon before taking him to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane.

Archaeologists were wowed to find the artact - called the Burnt Church - and have since combed it for historical evidence.Theyaposve found the mosaic somehow remained unscathed after a fire in AD which destroyed the fth-century church. The mosaic was part of the churchaposs flooring in Hippos, northern Israel. There can certainly be dferent explanations to the descriptions of loaves and fish in the mosaic, but you cannot ignore the similarity to the description in the New Testament, said head archaeologist, Dr Michael Eisenburg. For example, from the fact that the New Testament has a description of five loaves in a basket or the two fish depicted in the apse, as we find in the mosaic.    The expert was part of University of Haaaposs research team, which claims the find is new evidence that the accepted location of the miracle performed by Christ may have to be reconsidered. Hippos overlooks the Sea of Galilee - also known as the Kinneret - where it was once the site of a Greco-Roman city. The hilltop city was abandoned in around AD after a devastating earthquake struck.

The part of town where Dundee Harp was founded is long removed, but that section of town was still there in the s.”Rob continued as he traced Dundee Harp’s once fertile source of talent: “We can start at Pat Cassady’s barber shop, or across the street at the premises of Terry McMahon’s pub – The Harp.“Both were on Brook Street in the Westport area of Dundee, otherwise known as The Burn. Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/SNS-19281556-MS-Dundee-v-Alloa.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake blasts horrific decision that could have cost side three points","story":"Dundee boss James McPake blasted referee Alan Newlands for a “horric decision” that could have cost his side a vital three points.The Dens gaffer was annoyed to be talking about what he said was “as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see” when he should have been talking up a “controlled” win over a good Alloa Athletic side.The spot-kick would have given the Dark Blues the opportunity to see the game out easier as the Wasps piled on the pressure late on.McPake said: “It was a horric decision that could have in the end cost us – I have to say I don’t like criticising referees but it’s decisions like that that can cost points.“We had one at Tannadice that I was honest enough to say wouldn’t have mattered in the grand scheme of things but that one really could have mattered.“It was as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see.“I’m being genuine when I say I don’t like doing it because they have a hard enough job as it is but it was as stonewall penalty as I’ve seen.“They said nobody saw it.“I end up talking about something I shouldn’t be when I should be talking about the dominant display from us.”First-half goals from Danny Johnson and Jordan McGhee either side of Liam Dick’s th-minute equaliser for the visitors were enough to give McPake’s side victory.“It was a good three points,” he added.“I thought the performance was decent in spells. Alloa were decent, we knew they would be, and credit to them for playing some good football.“We really controlled large parts of that game and I thought the front three were a real threat. Josh McPake was excellent, it was a good first start for the kid, and Fin Robertson coming back was very controlled in the middle of the park.“I thought he dictated the play for large spells.

That was good momentum but it’s also a reminder that it can so easily just be dashed.“We just need to keep going the course. We’ve always spoken about one game at a time and I think that works both ways – you don’t get too high when it’s going well and you don’t get too low when it’s going against you.“We’ve looked at it early this week and seen why we weren’t as good as we should have been.“As we have done with everything, we’ve looked at all the details to see what we can do better and to stop that happening again.“We’ll be looking for a reaction on Saturday.”United host the Red Lichties just a fortnight after Dick Campbell’s side dumped them out of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup on penalties.Although United fielded a makesht team that day, defender Reynolds is wary of the quality Arbroath possess and has warned they must be on their game to see them off this time.“Arbroath are a good side, they’re going well and picking up results,” he added.“We saw that first hand in the cup – we still put out a decent enough team and we’ll need to be on our game.“If we turn up and play the way we did on Saturday, we’ll be in trouble. We’ll go away, look at the tapes from the cup game and see what we need to do to beat them.“We’ll re-group and go again. We said at the start, even after winning the first four games on the spin, it’s a long season and it’s a hard league.“People will drop points when you don’t expect it and there’ll be twists and turns. All we can do is focus on ourselves and we’ll focus on the Arbroath game on Saturday. That’s as far as we’ll look.”Former Aberdeen man Reynolds lined up alongside his third central-defensive partner of the league season last weekend as Troy Brown made his debut.And Reynolds admits he is hoping to find a settled relationship with Brown or Calum Butcher while Mark Connolly remains out injured.“You can see there’s a quality player there but, as with anyone that comes in, it’s going to take a bit of time to get used to the way we play and what the manager wants us to do.“I’m sure he’ll get there, he’s settled in well and the more game time he gets the better he will become.“It’s been dficult but, when Butch has come in, we’ve done well.

No drugs can give that sort of feeling.“The first time I did it, I came off stage and felt brilliant and it wasn’t brought on by any substance.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photos-show-royal-visit-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-evening-times-takes-look-back-glasgow-39-s-political-past","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"old-albion-motors-site-39-s-new-lease-life-celebrated-glasgow-39-s-doors-open-day","story":"PETER Burt can still remember his job interview at Albion Motors in Scotstoun, more than  years ago."},{"url":null,"title":"council-agrees-166m-loan-help-pay-equal-pay-deal","story":"Glasgow city council has secured another property-backed loan deal to help pay for its pound million equal pay settlement."},{"url":null,"title":"emeli-sande-cancels-performance-hmv-glasgow-argyle","story":"Emeli Sandeacute hascancelled herperformance in HMV Argyle street which was due to take place tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"set-free-dance-legends-n-trance-perform-glasgow-bingo","story":"DANCE music legends N-Trance will perform in a city bingo hall next month."},{"url":null,"title":"ariana-grande-surprises-staff-anchor-line-free-tickets-hydro-gig","story":"Ariana Grande has surprised staff at a city centre restaurant with free tickets to her show."},{"url":null,"title":"fewer-three-10-scots-want-second-scottish-independence-referendum-poll-suggests","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has been challenged to ditch plans for a second independence referendum after a new poll suggested fewer than three out of  Scots want there to be another vote in the next  months."},{"url":null,"title":"time-vote-top-glaswegian","story":"THE DEADLINE to vote for your Greatest Glaswegian of all time has been extended."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-take-look-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"east-end-dance-group-bringing-together-generations-gets-almost-100-000-cash-boost","story":"An intergenerational dance company that helps young people creatively connect with older generations through dance is amongst a number of groups sharing in . million of dormant bank account funding."},{"url":null,"title":"diageo-workers-suspend-strike-action-last-minute-pay-deal-offered","story":"Workers at Diageos distilleries have suspended strike action after a last-minute pay deal was offered."},{"url":null,"title":"stereophonics-play-hydro-next-year-part-uk-tour","story":"THE Stereophonics will play the Hydro next year as part of their UK tour."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-hotel-changes-hands-3-15m---turned-hostel","story":"A HOTEL in Glasgow has changed hands for pound. million, with its new owner planning to convert it into a hostel."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-lodge-leader-calls-respect-marches-ahead-weekend-glasgow-parades","story":"AN open letter from protestant and loyal order organisations in Glasgow has called for discipline from supporters as a de-escalation of tensions is worked towards across Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-weather-sizzle-mini-heatwave-brings-21c-weekend","story":"It may be September in Glasgow and Christmas goodies are already filling supermarket shelves."},{"url":null,"title":"new-farm-shop-kitchen-heron-takes-flight-lanarkshire-countryside","story":"FRESHLY foraged brambles in home-made scones.Scottish gins from nearby distilleries on the shelves of the deli.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

I would not want to send my children through that woods lit or unlit at night and would not want to go there alone as a single person in this day and age.During the meeting, an agent for developer Cala said they could only build a footpath to the northernedge of the site where it meets land owned by Muirfield Grove residents.He said: ldquoResidents of Muirfield Grove have refused to engage with us to allow us to usethe site.ldquoIt is up to East Lothian Council to use statutory powers to developa path.However, Mr Findlay asked: ldquoAre we really in the business of enforcing residents to give up the right to their own land Martin White, from Gullane Area Community Council, urged councillors to invite the developer to take another look at the access paths from the hew housing.He said: ldquoNo path that goes by a wood, evenit is lit, is a safe path to school.ldquoWe believe the plans need more work to be done on them it is not that thorough, it is not ready and it needs to be sent back.However, Councillor Lachlan Bruce said he did not believe the path posed a danger to children.He said: ldquoI do not understand why walking by the wood would be dangerous. I walked through woods to primary school.The committee approved the conditions with an added condition which called for the developer to produce details of a footpath link to the south of the strip of land owned by Muirfield Grove residents for approval before building begins.It also added an additional condition asking for a Construction Method Statement to be submitted prior to work beginning amid concerns about access to the site which is through a narrow C-class road and reports of heavy construction vehicles parking off site.A third additional condition, addressing the local authorityrsquos recent pledge to take action against a climate emergency, called for a report on actions taken to reduce carbon emissions on the site to be submitted.Following the meeting, Councillor Findlay, who was the sole member to vote against approving the plans, said: ldquoIam very disappointed with the decision of the planning committee in approving Calarsquos application for detailed planning permission for Saltcoats Field despite the fact that, in my opinion, it falls far short of fulfilling Policy T of the Local Development Plan  in terms of connectivity to the rest of the village.ldquoI am also disappointed that it did not approve of my proposed amendment to delay permission until connectivity issues have been sorted out as, at present, the two proposed pedestrian cycle routes either go over land owned by Gullane residents who have not given their permission to use or via the much longer route through Millennium Wood which is not a safe route to school or for use in low light or nighttime conditions.ldquoIt seems that, once again, members of the planning committee have ignored the wishes of the local community, the community council and their own planning policy."},{"url":null,"title":"electric-car-users-pay-use-council-owned-charging-points","story":"Plans to introduce fees across the countyrsquos public charging points, which are currently free to

That impacted on sales and our online audiences.The solution was to rebrand The Sunday Herald and launch a Sunday National to cater for an independence-supporting audience seven days, and to produce a Herald on Sunday fully aligned with the political stance and values of Monday to Saturdayrsquos Herald.A unique marketing opportunity beckoned.A Bafta winner I had a positive response to allowing the cameras in when, as Editor of The Sunday Post, we celebrated its centenary, and the experience of others in the spotlight, such as Glasgow Central Station and Edinburgh Airport, shows that providing the public with a unique insight helps provide a welcome understanding of our roles, responsibilities and challenges.However, it was important for our brands, The Herald, Evening Times and The National, to ensure that the production company had a track record of excellent work.Documentary producer director Sarah Howitt made the first series of ldquoScotlandrsquos Superhospital ndash following the move to the new hospital and more recently The Force: The Story of Scotlandrsquos police, which was nominated for a Scottish Bafta for Best Factual Series and for a Royal Television Society award for the same.Maurice and Sarah first worked together in  on a documentary entitled The Bridge: Fty Years Across The Forth, which won the Bafta Scotland best single documentary in . They also collaborated on The Town That Thread Built and Six Weeks To Save The World.Importantly, it was commissioned for the BBC, where context and impartiality are regarded as critical. Again, in the same way, we ask our public to trust our journalists to be fair and balanced, there is an expectation of the same from the BBC.So in rolled the camerashellip but for much longer than expected. More of that later.: Jeane Freeman announces public inquiry into building flaws at QEUH and Edinburgh Sick KidsTrust, credibility andfake newsSadly, despite our remarkable -year history, The Herald is not immune from the same criticism levelled at all mediandashthat we produce fake news, suppress and distort the truth. We are the worldrsquos longest-running national newspaper, but that counts for little amongst the online trolls who only want an echo chamber fort views.Our critics often use it as to beat us with. What better opportunity to show our integrity, balance, fairness and lack of bias.In addition, like most journalists, nothing irritates me more than seeing our profession and industry portrayed in dramas, soap and films as insensitive, intrusive and reckless with the truth.I am sure when you sit down to enjoy the shows you will see professional, dedicated and caring staff interested only in their audiences quality journalism.The Herald is staunchly apolitical. Importantly, audiences will see how wrong accusations of any political bias are. We represent all views and have brilliant columnists ndash given complete freedom to express their opinions.Insight and understandingThe news industry is challenged by growing digital consumption and declining print readership. We reach record overall audiences and are getting ever closer to the point where digital revenues and growing commercial partnerships exceed the more traditional revenue s in print. As we make that seismic transition, we need to manage our costs to allow us to continue to invest in the multi-media offering that will protect our long-term futureQuality journalism, be it in print or online, is expensive. Balancing that equation means streamlining processes, increasing efficiencies, structural changes and dficult conversations. The cameras were there to capture it all ndash painful though it was.Almost every industry has its own challenges and as journalists, we report without fear or favour. For viewers to have trust in us and our brand to have credibility it was important to be open and honest. Our readers will have a better insight and understanding of the complexities and dficulties of delivering quality content across many s and see that our commitment remains as strong as ever.Brexit madnessThe documentary features our comprehensive coverage of Brexit, free of any partisan agenda, and delivered for a Scottish audience. It shows our specialist teams at Holyrood and Westminster providing insight and analysis amid the chaos and confusion.It was to be a three-month period where we had to mind our language as the cameras covered the build-up to the UKrsquos exit from the EU.

So all that would be picked up as part of the assessment process but we wouldnt start with any position at all.\"He added: \"No-one should think that just because theres been a  referendum where Remain and Leave was used, there would be any reason why that would be relevant or appropriate for another referendum, or not as the case may be.\"Head of the Electoral Commission Andy ONeill said allowing it to test the question would mean people would be able to focus on the issues of the debate, rather than discussing the question itself.He said: \"We believe context can change, it may not change, we dont know that until weve done the question testing and given you the advice.\"I think one of the things you get from our expertise is confidence in the question and I think people - the voters, the campaigners - can have confidencewe provide a good product in terms of the advice.\"You can choose to accept it or not but we give you our advice.\"That confidence brings acceptance and it brings acceptance from the voter and the campaigners so you can then go off and debate the issues rather than the question.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: ldquoThere shouldnrsquot be another referendum as it would lead to economic turmoil and deeper ision, but -there ever is one - itrsquos vital that itrsquos legal and fair, and doesnrsquot have a rigged question chosen by the SNP.ldquoThe Electoral Commission has said that yes no questions are unfair, and recommended a remain leave question in the EU referendum.ldquoBut this Referendums Bill is taking up parliamentary time that could be better spent on focussing on how to improve public services in Scotland - not ways to create more ision.The Referendums Bill is designed to create a general framework for referendums.However it is aimed primarily at paving the way for Indyref next year,the UK grants Holyrood the required powers for a new vote."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-move-shut-scottish-government-39-spin-39-economy","story":"The Scottish Parliamentrsquos economy committee wants to end privileged ldquopre-release access for ministers and special advisers, thereby aligning the Scottish system with the UK one.At present, Scottish ministers can see Scottish economic growth and retail sales index data up to five days before they are made public.:Scotlands economy is on the brink of a recessionIn June, the committee said by a majority - with all SNP MSPs opposed - that early access should end entirely for both data sets, and access to other economic data be cut to one day.The intention is to stop ministers working up ldquospin operations to put the most positive gloss on potentially embarrassing numbers, and so frame their reporting in the media.The practice of early access to data for UK Government ministers has not been used by either the Bank of England or the Office for National Statistics since .The economy committee will today propose a Bill at Holyrood to follow suit.The move is supported by all opposition parties in Holyrood, and so should become law.Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: ldquoFor too long SNP ministers have got away with trying to bend statistics to suit their narrow political agenda.ldquoThe excellent work of the countryrsquos leading statisticians is being weaponised by the SNP before they have even published.ldquoThis Bill will seek to put a stop to that and bring the SNP government into line with best practice on statistical publications around the UK.ldquoThe fact that the SNP was the only party not supporting the Bill in Committee tells its own story.Green Andy Wightman MSP said: ldquoThe committee has taken evidence from a series of experts who expressed their concern about the privileged access to statistics that Scottish Ministers continue to enjoy.:David Cameron secretly asked the Queen to back the Union in the  Scottish independence campaign\"This flies in the face of statistical best practice.

It helped to put a slightly dferent perception on things.Shortly after the referendum result on September  , the ex-PM was caught on a TV camera during a visit to New York, telling Michael Bloomberg, the then cityrsquos mayor, how Her Majesty had ldquopurred down the line when he informed of the referendum result.Mr Cameron later apologised to the Queen, admitting he had felt ldquoextremely sorry and very embarrassed for confirming she had wanted Scotland to remain in the UK.Todayrsquos bombshell revelation comes in the week that marks the fth anniversary of the referendum result - when Scots backed maintaining the -year-old Union by  per cent to  per cent - and when the UK Supreme Court deliberates on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks was lawful and which many politicians protested had dragged the Queen into politics.Last night, Alex Salmond, the former First Minister, said: ldquoBegging a constitutional monarch to make a political intervention is not only totally improper but an indication of how desperate Prime Minister Cameron was in the final stages of the Scottish referendum campaign.ldquoScotland should always remember that Westminster does not recognise any political rule book, declared the ex-party leader.He added: ldquoCameron started the campaign uber-confident and ended up in a blue funk.

North of Dundee, there are no Catholic high schools and very few primary ones, likewise in the Borders, there is effectively ldquocomplete integration in education. Yet anti-Catholic hate crimes are still committed in these areas in flagrant contradiction of her abolitionist panacea.It is of course, complete tolerance that should be the goal together with a willingness to accept that a plural society should have a erse and pluralistic education system. Perhaps those who attack Catholic schools should reveal their true motivation they might admit that they loathe religion in general, Christianity in particular and the Catholic manestation of Christianity most especially.They might also admit that atheist or humanist parents who indoctrinate their children in accordance with the Gospel of Richard Dawkins are imposing upon them a belief system or dogma which brooks no counter or challenge, and which considers itself to be truer, purer and altogether more enlightened than any religious system of belief and infuses its adherents with a zeal to convert non-believers by law or by force.Dawkins or Ms Goring can no more disprove the existence of God than I can prove it. They have no stronger claim to veracity for their belief system than I have for mine. The dference between us is that I respect theirs and do not wish to impose conformity with mine upon them. It is in this crucial distinction that we see why atheism inevitably becomes tyrannical.Ironically, the conflict between a small number of marchers on a few Glasgow streets recently is of course political not religious. Although irrelevant to the existence of Catholic schools, it is as depressing as it is instructive to see the flames of those conflicts being fanned by some who would use them as a stick to beat Catholic schools with.Peter Kearney, Director, Catholic Media Office, Glasgow G.IT is most unfortunate that Rosemary Goring takes the view that Catholic schools must be abolished.The secular agenda in Scotland is that faith not be taught as true but as a matter for relative study. The insistence is that faith be excluded from the schools criteria for employment and admission, something which would have the effect of destroying the much-vaunted \"Catholic ethos\".Schools are an extension of the family and the community, not the state. Education is about the formation of habits and virtues it cannot exclude the religious dimension. Serving the most disadvantaged and underprivileged has always been central to the mission of Catholic education ndash Catholic schools are the most ethnically erse and international of all maintained schools. Catholic schools are oases of ersity and tolerance they instil a strong ethos of service to wider society and the sense of identity and belonging which independent inspectors consistently applaud in them is what leads to broad-minded citizens.Martin Conroy, Cockburnspath.ROSEMARY Goringrsquos journalese is deeply flawed. The diminution of active living Christian faith and practice by using the sociological category \"religion\" renders her arguments invalid. She would not write about politics without distinguishing the philosophies of the political parties who constitute our democracy.Richard Dawkins is himself an exemplar of indoctrination and is well recognised as a shallow and pejorative commentator on religion.Irish Catholic immigrants were ordered by the hierarchy not to integrate with Protestants. Now there are many marriages between Protestants and Catholics in the west of Scotland. Not everyone is at each otherrsquos throats even though the Catholic Church continues to discriminate against Protestant members of these families by refusing to recognise us as equals in Christian Faith.Rev Dr Robert Anderson, Dundonald.IT is naive to view Catholic schools as sectarian and other schools as neutral.Every school,it is to address questions of value, meaning and purpose, must do so from a particular philosophy. Failure to address these issues leaves education dry and barren.Catholic schools present a belief system and le philosophy that pupils can ultimately embrace or reject, but they know that they are being educated in a Catholic context.Meanwhile, most other schools induct pupils into a left-leaning liberal secular humanist progressive therapeutic feminist environmentalist LGBT-activist ldquosocial justice philosophy that happens to be remarkably similar to that of the Government. These pupils are usually unaware that they are being educated according to a particular philosophy.The key feature of Catholic schools is the offering of a distinct ethos that appeals to many parents and pupils, and yields better outcomes than the Governmentrsquos educational ideology. The Government is trying to squeeze Catholic schools into its own failed mould, but many of their distinctives have survived so far.Rosemary Goring overlooks all of this and focuses on the alleged contribution Catholic education makes to the bizarre tribalism known as sectarianism. But the answer to irrational hostilities is not to deprive families of the option to have their children educated according to their own values ndash values that have no place for mindless tribalism.Richard Lucas, Leader of The Scottish Family Party, Glasgow G.THOUGH the heading on Rosemary Gorings article is contentious and somewhat simplistic, she nevertheless offers relevant and tangible evidence for the ending of denominational education in Scotland.The origins of Ms Goringss report emanate from a recent newspaper article by Tom Wood, former Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police wherein he contends that Catholic schools need to be abolished to eradicate sectarianism. Mr Wood carelessly dismisses the origins of the sectarian ide in Scotland as fundamentally an Irish problem that was transported to Scotland in the th century and infers an equal responsibility for the perpetuation of the issue throughout the next century. This is far from the truth. Catholics in Scotland suffered from widespread institutionalised discrimination in employment, housing, education and in most walks of Scottish le until more recent times.At the opening of St Modans High School in Stirling in , a school I was proud to attend both as a pupil and as a teacher, JL Foxworthy, the redoubtable headteacher, addressed his audience of young people and parents with the hope that the school could produce future lawyers, doctors and teachers. It was his sincere wish that the Catholic community could integrate itself into Scottish le and gain acceptance in a society where prejudice remained commonplace, through their roles in middle class professions. As Ms Goring observes, separate schools were considered necessary at this time as they were the only vehicle for Catholic advancement in existence in an intolerant and prejudiced Scotland. This rationale is now, however, largely redundant.In an increasingly secular age, Catholic schools and the Orange Order have one thing in common ndash they appear archaic, isive and cling to an image of Scotland that has all but disappeared into the mists of time. It is dficult to argue, as Ms Goring rightly states, that st century Catholic schools are an obstacle to complete integration and that denominational schools have become an anomaly. The Catholic Churchs ambiguous teachings on LGBT rights, same-sex marriage and the continuation of the inequitable and antiquated approval system which vets applicants for posts in Catholic schools to determine their religious suitability are not sustainable in a liberal and inclusive Scottish society. It is time to try and see the bigger picture through the prism of future generations. It is time for the phasing out of Catholic schools in Scotland.Owen Kelly, Stirling.Evidence suggests prejudice and bias are learned rather than being innate and I agree with Rosemary Goring that therefore denominational schools have no place in todayrsquos society. I would go further as I see no place in our schools for any form of religious education. However in the absence of sectarianism I guarantee some zealots would still vent their collective spleen at a minority over some other perceived dference. ldquoBloody vegans coming over here refusing to eat haggis itrsquos an insult to Burns our heritage. Build a wall, send them back to Vega they are not the same as us, stone them!Ms Goring does of course ignore the ldquoelephant in the room of private education as the problems it causes by reinforcing societal isions and the preferentially enhancing future le-prospects of their alumni is far more destructive than religious bigotry.However, currently there is as much chance of removing religious education from schools as there is of ending private education, as it suits the Establishment that they exist and as long as we are fighting amongst ourselves we pose no threat to them.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.Read more: Rosemary Goring: If we want to end sectarianism, we must abolish Catholic schools"},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-soap-television-diluting-impact-nonsense","story":"We all took readily to Brookside and its Scouse scallies and great writing by Jimmy McGovern.

The one-time soap fan claims the genre now faces ldquopotentially fatal crises.Is he right  Viewing figures support the argument. EastEnders once pulled in  million for an episode. .

The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

She added: “Christmas and New Year is a time which should be spent with family, and there are few days in the year when families are off at the same time. “The results of Usdaw’s survey show that the overwhelming majority of respondents want to spend more time with their families during Christmas and New Year.“I hope all of my MSP colleagues will recognise that everyone deserves a day off for New Year and will support the motion that I have tabled in the Scottish Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister announces extra funding for scots farmers","story":"Scotland#s farming leaders have welcomed #. million of extra funding announced by the Prime Minister on a visit to Aberdeenshire.The cash, over the next two years, is in addition to the £ million package for farmers unveiled earlier this week as part of the Government’s Spending Review.Boris Johnson announced the additional money, recommended in the Bew Review, during a visit to a farm near Banchory where he met NFU Scotland officials.He’d earlier toured Peterhead fishmarket.Speaking after meeting Mr Johnson, NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said: “On top of the Chancellor’s welcome announcement in his spending review that Scotland is to receive £ million in convergence funding, we welcome the positive outcome of the Bew Review into future funding allocations and Government’s speedy response to the review’s recommendations.“Taken together, the two announcements will inject £ million into Scottish agriculture over the next two years.

Transport is our biggest decarbonisation challenge, with our remote and rural setting placing our islanders in the position of producing a signicant carbon footprint.“Initiatives like this are presenting us with opportunities to reduce this carbon footprint and support Orkney Islands Council’s climate emergency declaration. I look forward to the project progressing.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Launched by new charity Center for Countering Digital Hate, stars lined up to show their support, some of whom will hopefully start following the suggestion more closely themselves.As a phrase, ‘don’t feel the trolls’ has been in use since the early days of internet forums, where the word ‘troll’ came to mean someone sometimes malevolent, but always time-wasting, users who got their kicks from bothering others. They weren’t always nasty. Sometimes they were the jesters of a group, deploying practical jokes and making mischief. This kind were an early example of what’s now known as ‘s***posting’, the creation and sharing of content that is, by design, pointless and insincere, underpinned by a nihilistic view about the state of current affairs, and the sense that why not fritter away time being surreal and annoying to public figures online,society is in meltdown anyway. Dictionary defines the term as “to post off-topic, , or offensive contributions to an online forum with the intent to derail the discussion or provoke other participants”.But at their worst, trolls were abusive, often racist, homophobic, sexist and threatening, and they prolerated in online spaces dominated by young men banding together and hostile to others, where it was possible to use anonymity with sinister intent, encouraged by the toxic bravado that set the tone of belonging in so many humour and gaming forums.: High profile celebs pledge not to publicise social media abuse they receive from vile trollsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereWhen online abuse began to be discussed in the mainstream as a result of social media usage becoming widespread, there was a conflation of ‘trolling’ with ‘abuse’ that wasn’t especially helpful to understanding either, because while trolling could encapsulate abuse, the word minimised and was inaccurate about what was happening. Traditional media has often been slow off the mark to understand and analyse online behaviour.It’s easy to brush off abuse as just some online thing when it’s called trolling, and that propagates the idea that online threats have minimal inpact when the reality is not only can they be as law-breaking as threats and intimidation in the offline world, but studies have shown they have a diminishing effect on demographics already under-represented in public discourse.Amnesty International has been looking into the impact of online abuse, specically aimed at women, and in  released a study conducted in eight countries showing that almost a quarter of women online had experienced online abuse or harassment, and that  per cent of those felt their physical safety was threatened as a result of online abuse. The impact has slowly begun to be understood as a freedom of speech issue, with abuse leading to self-censorship and stress, preventing women from expressing themselves freely and joining in public le.Shockingly, Diane Abbot alone received  per cent of abusive tweets sent to MPs in the weeks prior to the  election. Similarly, when thetook the interesting and commendable step of analysing comments, they found that women and black writers received a disproportionate amount of abuse. There is a school of thought that the internet, and particularly social media, is the cause of abuse. Certainly, there are many exacerbating factors. But social media also makes existing thoughts and tendencies visible, and what’s on view here is racism and sexism that already exists in iniduals, expressed in violent and threatening ways.: Humza Yousaf: I would meet Twitter trolls who send me racist messages: Nicola Sturgeon urges online trolls to ‘take a long hard look at themselves’In her recent book of essays, Trick Mirror, a brilliant and excavating look at contemporary culture, there is a section where author Jia Tolentino examines trolling and the “mutual dependency” that can encourage it. Arguing online can be addictive and cathartic. Who doesn’t want to swear on Twitter sometimes  But while blocking can feel like doing nothing, it’s still taking an action, and a more decisive one than engaging with and providing attention to those who seek it.For a very small minority of users who are highly visible, engaging with ‘trolls’ also becomes part of their personal brand. Let’s be clear – this is not about taking a stand in a useful or important way, but performatively squabbling with anonymous or clearly malevolent accounts, sometimes to depict themselves as at the forefront of a social movement. It’s also frustrating to see an easy supply of responses to career controversialists like Katie Hopkins and Piers Morgan, who dangle bait and always get a bite. Common sense seems in short supply in these instances.But where is corporate responsibility in all this  Blocking and muting is good advice, but it’s also treating the symptom of a larger disease. We’re encouraged by social sites to put more and more of ourselves online under the guise of making connections and networking. Social media has been an important tool for people under-represented in mainstream public expression, and has helped communities and movements bolster one another and flourish. But just as capitalism encourages us to create personal brands and turn ourselves into walking advertisements in increasingly insidious ways, the ultimate goal of social media sites is to profit from their users. The negligence over cracking down on content which is abusive and prejudiced cannot be overlooked. When Amnesty International began to examine the impact of online abuse on freedom of expression, they discovered much of it was against the terms and conditions of social sites which let it flourish unchecked. Facebook has infamously banned images of breast-feeding, including any nipple shots on its sister site Instagram, but far-right propaganda and hate speech run rampant.Blocking and muting, in order not to feed the trolls, is for the most part a sensible coping strategy for iniduals. But placing the onus on social media users to solve the problem sites have failed to, which disproportionately impacts women and racial and sexual minorities, lets social behemoths who make staggering profits from our data off the hook. Perhaps it’s time for legal requirement for social media sites to enforce their own community standards and deal with hate speech adequately, at risk of financial penalty.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron reveals he did urge queen to intervene in scottish independence referendum","story":"Former Prime Minister#David Cameron#has revealed he did influence the Queen to intervene in the  Scottish independence referendum and back the No campaign.In a bombshell revelation, which breaks with conventional protocol, he admits he askedthe monarch would \"raise an eyebrow\" in support of Better Together after a shock poll put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time, just  days ahead of the vote.In a two-part BBC series looking at his premiership, Mr Cameron reveals that he communicated with the Queens Private Secretary about how she might be asked to show her support for keeping the union together.Mr Cameron was staying at Balmoral when the poll findings were revealed in a Sunday newspaper, and he says the result was like a \"blow to the solar plexus” and led to a “mounting sense of panic that this could go the wrong way.”He says: “I remember conversations I had with my Private Secretary and he had with the Queen’s Private Secretary and I had with the Queen’s Private Secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional but just a raising of the eyebrow even you know, a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a dference.”As a result, just four days before voters went to the polls, the Queen made a rare intervention, telling a well-wisher outside Crathie Kirk that she hoped people would \"think very carefully about the future\".The remark was welcomed by No campaigners, as it received widespread press coverage. Mr Cameron says: “It was certainly well covered [by the media], although the words were very limited, I think it helped to put a slightly dferent perception on things.”The revelation again jeopardises the Queens traditional political neutrality - which Mr Cameron had also previously thrown into doubt.In the aftermath of the No victory, he was overheard telling businessman Michael Bloomberg, that the monarch \"purred down the line\" at news of the result. He told Mr Bloomberg: “The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying: ‘It’s alright, it’s OK’. That was something. She purred down the line.”The SNP declined to comment on Mr Camerons latest revelations, with a party source saying they had been \"unfazed\" by the Queens remark at the time, and were now \"focused on the future, not the past\".However, former First Minister, Alex Salmond said: “Begging a constitutional monarch to make a political intervention is not only totally improper but an indication of how desperate Prime Minister Cameron was in the final stages of the Scottish referendum campaign.\"Five years on Scotland should remember that Westminster does not recognise any political rule book. Cameron started the campaign uber-confident and ended up in a blue funk. I doubtScotland will let the establishment off the hook next time around.\"He added: \"As to Cameron’s suggestion that he was successful in securing a royal intervention, I doubt that.\"What I can vouch for is that the week after the referendum I was asked to meet the Queen at Balmoral. We discussed Cameron’s “purring comments” to Michael Bloomberg in New York in the aftermath of the referendum where he again blurted out what he claimed were her private thoughts.\"Unlike David Cameron I will not ulge what she said but suffice to say she was very far from amused at his behaviour.”In his book, For The Record, Mr Cameron has also revealed how on the day of the poll which put the Yes campaign ahead, he had to prepare for an audience with the Queen \"the woman who had reigned over the UK for  years\" while he was \"the man who had allowed a vote on its possible disintegration.\"He wrote: “Of course, she was completely charming — the whole household was. But as Prince Philip showed me the barbecue he had designed to roast grouse and sausages up at the hillside bothy, the referendum was clearly on everyones mind. They gingerly asked questions, but knew they shouldnt express too strong an opinion.“And then, the next day at breakfast, there it was in cold print. Among the kippers and the kedgeree was The Sunday Times, with the headline \"Yes vote leads in Scots poll\".“The Queen wasnt there — she usually had breakfast alone. Instead, I was surrounded by ladies-in-waiting, equerries and the moderator of the Church of Scotland. I tried to reassure them about \"rogue polls\", but I was struggling to convince myself, let alone them.“One week later, however, the Queen spoke to some of those gathered outside Crathie Kirk and said she hoped Scots would \"think very carefully\" about the vote. I was delighted.”His latest revelation comes in the BBC One series, ‘The Cameron Years’, which begins tonight, and which charts the key milestones of his political career, while also hearing from allies and critics who worked closely alongside him.The series also sees George Osborne blame Cameron for feeding the idea \"Brussels was to blame\" for the UKs domestic troubles, and Michael Gove saying he thought Mr Cameron believed their friendship meant he wouldn’t \"stray from the fold\".Mr Osborne also tells the programme he is “very sorry for what happened” and admits he feels “responsible” because of his role of Chancellor of the Exchequer, adding that “we held a referendum we should never have held” and “the consequences for the country are grave.” He says: “I feel very sorry for what happened, and I feel responsible, I was the Chancellor of the Exchequer in that Government, we held a referendum we should never have held, we then lost that referendum and the consequences for the country are grave and the only thing I can plea in my mitigation is that a huge number of people wanted that referendum, and I made a case against it, but it wasn’t heard, and David Cameron was just one of a number of British Prime Ministers who had fed this idea that we were dferent than Europe, that Brussels was to blame and that the public ultimately had to have a say, and we’ve all paid a price for it in my view”.Reacting to Mr Osbornes remarks, Martin Whitfield, Labour MP for East Lothian, said: “The Cameron Osborne government got us into this mess and they must take responsibility for the economic hardship and isions in society they have caused.“Nationalists are always looking for someone  to blame, whether that be Scottish nationalists blaming Westminster, or English nationalists blaming Brussels. We need to build bridges, not erect barriers. “The only way out of this mess is to give the people of the UK the opportunity to remain in the EU.”In the programme both David Cameron and George Osborne also speak openly about the fraught conversations they had in the Downing Street flat, trying to convince Michael Gove to come down on their side.Michael Gove says he felt “some of the conversations we had were attempts on his part to reassure himself that our friendship would mean that I wouldn’t stray from the fold.”Mr Gove says: “I think David understandably felt that since I’d been prepared to knuckle under on a number of occasions beforehand and put my own feelings to one side in order to serve the team, that on this occasion, that I would do the same.”Mr Cameron describes as a “bombshell” the moment when Gove said he would support the Leave campaign.George Osborne remembers the moment he warned Gove “ you go to the Leave campaign you will destroy this Government,we lose this referendum, David Cameron will have to go, there’s no way he’ll be able to survive, and everything we’ve worked on will fall apart.”* The Cameron Years, is on BBC One tonight at pm.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -.

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set. Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"almost 3000 polish people left northern ireland in past year over","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Weir was featured in the party election broadcast before the Westminster election in .Speaking in the broadcast the DUP leader Arlene Foster said: \"Farmers, like Charlie, know the opportunities leaving the European Union will present as well as acknowledging the challenges.\"Only the DUP can secure the best deal for Northern Ireland as we leave the European Union.\"Mr Weir acknowledged he voted leave in the  referendum but said he know believes he \"didnt know the full story\" data-dfpadtargetingCharlie Weir said he supports the idea of a backstop for Northern Ireland\"And nowI was to vote again, Id vote to remain, personally, from an agricultural point of view.\"Here in Northern Ireland, for example, we receive £m in CAPfunding from Europe andfarmers werent getting that money they couldnt survive.\"Farmers would be at a loss.\"Mr Weir said he had listened to the \"stories that were told about the big red bus and all the extra money there was going to be for the health service and I thought that we could probably get a better deal\".However, he no longer believes the UK will get a deal. \"I dont think theres going to be a deal at the minute andwe leave with a hard Brexit, I think that agriculture will be decimated.\"I think the only option left for the government at the minute is to go for an extension until theyre in a position to sort things out, whether that [is] with Boris going for an election and getting a government that he can actually control with the power to vote things through.\"He said he supports the DUP on % of its policies but not Brexit.\"I think the backstop is being overplayed big time, \" he said.\"I dont see a big problem with the backstop. In fact, the backstop would have been good and it would have meant the best of both worlds.\"Youd have countries wanting to invest in Northern Ireland so that they would have traded with Europe and the UK.\"It would have brought a lot of inward investment and would have made Northern Ireland a very rich and wealthy country,\" he said.\"The DUP are completely against the backstop.

For my part, I know we can do that for the benefit of all our citizens without compromising the constitutional arrangements.\"The DUP leader said her party recognised that many in the Republic were \"shocked and disappointed\" at the result of the  Brexit referendum.\"I respect the fact that Ireland has sought to bring about solutions which would keep the UK in the closest possible future relationship with the EU,\" she said.\"But equally Ireland has to recognise that the referendum result has to be upheld and that ultimately it is for the Government of the UK to determine whether future arrangements are compatible with the referendum result.\" Mrs Foster insisted that a Brexit deal would not be achievedthat involves a backstop, whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland-specic.\"Those who know anything about Northern Ireland will appreciate that long-term arrangements cannot be secured in Northern Ireland unless supported by a majority of unionists and nationalists,\" she said.\"The majority of unionists do not and will not support the arrangements as envisaged in the backstop as set out in the draft withdrawal agreement.\"Some commentators say DUP influence in Westminster is on the wane and that a deal can be achieved without DUP input. \"The reality, however, is that regardless of particular numbers, no agreement will pass Parliament without the buy-in of the unionist community.\"The DUP leader said Northern Ireland must leave the customs union and the single market with the rest of the UK.\"Northern Ireland trades more within the United Kingdom single market than all other markets combined - % of all goods leaving Belfast Port are bound for Great Britain,\" she said.\"While recognising the importance of north-south trade, economically Northern Ireland is integrated with the Great Britain market in a way that cannot be damagedour economy is to flourish.\"Mrs Foster argued that the DUPs \"incredible influence\" at Westminster, through its confidence and supply deal with the Tories and the extra funding secured for Northern Ireland, \"is not a barrier to devolution but rather should help oil the wheels of devolution\".Earlier, the DUP leader told UTV that her party would consider a Brexit deal that didnt include a role for Stormont.

They have also appealed for sanitary products.A Facebook post, accompanied by pictures of almost empty shelves, said: \"We are almost empty. This is a statement we never thought we would make, but with the pressures of school unorms, the long summer break and of course Universal Credit, we have been very busy in the food bank.

Thats why weve written to the Secretary of State to request an extension of the provisions in the absence of an Executive.\"It is so frustrating that I cant do what I was elected to do and help change the law to protect the most vulnerable here. The price for political failure is being paid by those least able to cope.

His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final

the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures llanfair caereinion celebrates deri woods centenary","story":"Caereinion High School Sixth Form students give a helping hand on the barefoot wltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtalking trail at Deriltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Woods.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever. We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus.

He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I opened my eyes wider, I closed my mouth more, I pushed my hair back and did ious things, changed clothes as well ndash I tried an alternative camera.Ms Hallam said she begrudged paying extra to have an image taken in a photo booth when free smartphone photos work for others.ldquoHow many other iniduals are probably either spending money unnecessarily or having to go through the process on numerous occasions of a system that really should be able to factor in a broad range of ethnicities  she explained.Ms Hallam proceeded with one of the images and received her passport without any further problems.When posting about the issue on Twitter at the time, the Passport Office tweeted back to her, saying it was sorry the photo upload service hadnrsquot ldquoworked as it should. --Ms Hallam was told by the system that it looked like her eyes were closed and that it could not find the outline of her head  --The Home Office responded to PA, saying: ldquoWe are determined to make the experience of uploading a digital photograph as simple as possible, and will continue working to improve this process for all of our customers.ldquoIn the vast majority of cases where a photo does not pass our automated check, customers may override the outcome and submit the photo as part of their application.ldquoThe photo checker is a customer aide that is designed to check a photograph meets the internationally agreed standards for passports.Noel Sharkey, professor of articial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield, believes lack of ersity in the workplace and an unrepresentative sample of black people is one of the reasons why the error may have happened. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The online photo checker system tells users whether the image is suitable for their passport, such as lighting and expressions  --ldquoWe know that ithas problems with gender as well, it has a real problem with women too generally, andyoursquore a black woman yoursquore screwed, itrsquos really bad, itrsquos not fit for purpose and I think itrsquos time that people started recognising that, he said.ldquoPeople have been struggling for a solution for this in all sorts of algorithmic bias, not just face recognition, but algorithmic bias in decisions for mortgages, loans, and everything  and itrsquos still happening.Dr Saurabh Johri, an AI and data science specialist at Babylon, said AI is only as good as the data it uses and for some time it has been known that these systems are prone to exacerbate biases in the data.ldquoIn this instance, itrsquos possible that there is bias in the training data but equally it could simply be a wider limitation of the technology, he added.The Race Equality Foundation said it believes the system was not tested properly to seeit would actually work for black or ethnic minority people, calling it ldquotechnological or digital racism.ldquoPresumably there was a process behind developing this type of technology which did not address issues of race ethnicity and as a result it disadvantages black and minority ethnic people, Samir Jeraj, the charityrsquos policy and practice officer, commented..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Passport photo checker ly flags black man us lips as open mouth article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

is encouraging schools here to take advantage of beneficial dog safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

a woman arrived at the premises suffering from anaphylactic shock.Emmett McCann , whose parents Mary and Barry McCann live at Kelly Gardens in the Co Armagh town, qualied as a pharmacist in , graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams. I know mum and dad were glad to see me get through it.”‘Make my day... give us a wave’ says cop\"  \"  Malcolm McKeown Murder: Police release C.C.T.V. footage of car used by gunman Coremetrics

The medical teams were incredibly calm, and it was very helpful in such a frightening situation.” Trevor continued, “I was in hospital for five days. I knew it would be traumatic for my two young boys to visit, so we waited a few days before bringing them to the hospital.“I have had surgery on two occasions already with more to follow.“As a joiner this has of course had a massive impact on my livelihood and while I would love nothing more than to be back at work, I’m also aware that it will take some time. “I am very grateful that my limb has been saved and I now want to give something back to this charity as I know it takes £, a day to keep it going.“It was fantastic to be able to visit the air ambulance base recently to meet with the HEMS team who treated me at the scene. I have two sons and they thoroughly enjoyed being able to finish school a bit early for the important visit to the base and see the helicopter and meet the team. “I’m so grateful to them and also to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and all of the other medical professionals who have treated me so far.”Dr Darren Monaghan said: “It was great for the team to be able to welcome Trevor and his family to the base. Trevor’s story is a prime example of how important it is to be able to provide early clinical intervention and le and limb saving medical treatment at the scene.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues.
